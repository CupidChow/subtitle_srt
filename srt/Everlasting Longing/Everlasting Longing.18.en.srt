17
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,790
I know

18
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,200
your heart longs for Jun Qiluo.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,340
But don't forget

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
that she is from Yannan.

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,920
No matter what,

22
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,230
she can't be your main wife.

23
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,120
After marrying Sun Zhaomin,

24
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,280
you can still take Jun Qiluo as a concubine.

25
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
I cannot comply, Xu.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,590
Please reconsider it carefully.

27
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,030
What?

28
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,560
Are you going to defy me for a Yannan woman?

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
No, Xu.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,360
But the marriage

31
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,030
needs Zhaomin's approval.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,630
She's currently handling
her father's funeral,

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,360
and I'm afraid

34
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,960
this might come across as too autocratic.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,630
Stop using unfounded accusations

36
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,560
to justify yourself.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm discussing this with you first
because Zhaomin

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
is still mourning.

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,750
Otherwise, I could just issue the decree.

40
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,910
Yes, Xu.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,310
I will never defy you,

42
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,360
but this matter still requires
Princess Zhaomin's approval.

43
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,470
You...

44
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,150
Never mind.

45
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,590
I will

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
speak with Zhaomin before making a decision.

47
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,680
Tomorrow, we will go back to the Royal City.

48
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,870
The Wolf Lord will be invested in five days.

49
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,360
Before then,

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,840
focus on the Sacrifice Ritual

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,960
and do not cause any more trouble.

52
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,630
As for the Yannan spy,

53
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,000
keep searching

54
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,960
until you find him.

55
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,150
Lie.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,770
I failed to catch the Yannan spy.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
It's my fault.

58
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,470
Looks like Xi Changkun
was just trying to distract me

59
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,890
by talking to me today.

60
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,530
What did he say?

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
Nothing, just trying to
cause a rift between us.

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,590
Ridiculous. How could he

63
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,150
ever cause a rift between us?

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,150
By the way, the king

65
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,000
has ordered the ritual

66
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,360
to take place five days
after we return to the Royal City.

67
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,430
By then, Xi Lin may have the evidence.

68
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,430
In five days?

69
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,150
We don't have much time.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,520
Lie,

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,560
when we're back in the Royal City...

72
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,240
Our statuses might change,

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,600
and we may not be able

74
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,630
to walk side by side like this again.

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
That's nonsense.

76
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,870
We'll be best friends forever.

77
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,040
Whenever you want,

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,680
I'll be there.

79
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,310
Princess!

80
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,360
Princess, you can't go in!

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
Aunt Xiao,

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,690
please save my father.

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,600
Get up.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why are you crying?

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Aunt Xiao,

86
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,070
only you can save my father.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
It isn't concluded yet.

88
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,870
Take it easy.

89
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,630
The king didn't consult me

90
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,210
before sending your father
to the Royal City.

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,480
He must be avoiding suspicion
because of my ties

92
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,750
to the Xi Clan.

93
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,180
Don't worry.

94
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,040
If your father is truly innocent,

95
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
he will be released.

96
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Aunt Xiao,

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,430
my father was wrongly
accused by General Lie.

98
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,240
Stop overthinking.

99
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,430
Go get some rest.

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,310
Take the princess back to her tent.

101
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Yes.

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,590
Your Majesty.

103
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,120
What are you doing with this?

104
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,600
Someone once flew a kite
outside Consort Li's tent.

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,120
She was so pleased.

106
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,360
So I had this one made
to match that kite.

107
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,310
Since you haven't seen her for a while,
maybe...

108
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,480
You're bold to guess my thoughts.

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,640
I wouldn't dare.

110
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,630
Do you know who flew the kite?

111
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,120
I heard

112
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,200
it was Mr. Luo.

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,220
(What should we do if our ally fails?)

114
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,480
Did the king ask you here?

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
Yes.

116
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,750
So, he knows about Jun Feifan

117
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,040
helping Xuan Lie compete
for the Wolf Lord?

118
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,880
Yes.

119
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,190
The king heard about it

120
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,600
and was worried about you and Jun Feifan,

121
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,510
so he sent me to help you
and escort him back.

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,390
What else did you find out?

123
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm just following orders.

124
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,530
We trained together since we were little.

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,480
You've always been tight-lipped.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,390
I won't push you this time.

127
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,070
Thank you, Commander.

128
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680
I'll send a letter to the king.

129
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,310
Your mission's complete.

130
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,310
Place it over there.

131
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,120
And then mop the floor.

132
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,440
There you go.

133
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,790
Father!

134
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,190
Yujue! Come here.

135
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,120
Everyone, keep it tidy.

136
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,430
Set up the tables and chairs properly.

137
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,830
Look at you, a stand-up businessman.

138
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,800
This family should've been
in your hands ages ago!

139
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,110
You bet!

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,400
Yujue,

141
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,190
you bring the business conference forward.

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Have you informed the family elders

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
and the shopkeepers?

144
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh, Father.

145
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,160
There's no need to worry.

146
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,000
I've informed them all.

147
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
What are you doing?

148
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,270
What are we doing?

149
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,400
Can't you see?

150
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,270
It's for the business conference.

151
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,360
Feifan hasn't returned yet.

152
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,040
How dare you move the meeting up?

153
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,390
Jun Jiangjuan!

154
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,480
A girl uses her tongue, not her fist.

155
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,560
And who says we moved it without permission?

156
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,870
I've consulted the family elders!

157
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,840
Yujue, Uncle,

158
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
Father is still unconscious,

159
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,390
and you're so eager to take charge.

160
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,660
He's done so much for you.

161
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,150
How can you turn your back on him?

162
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,480
We're just helping

163
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,360
to lighten your father's burden.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Exactly!

165
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,550
Xiukun,

166
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,910
you don't understand.

167
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,440
Taking charge of family business
is not easy work.

168
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,790
See? Preparing for the conference

169
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,440
has left me skin and bones!

170
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,910
Don't give me that face here.

171
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't believe
the family elders agree to this.

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,750
You must've manipulated them!

173
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Watch your mouth!

174
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,360
Don't go around
accusing people without proof.

175
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,790
Jiangjuan, you're out of control!

176
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,200
You still owe me

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,750
for injuring my back last time.

178
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,510
Baby girl, you're not grown up yet.

179
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,680
Go drink your milk!

180
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,350
Father,

181
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,320
don't get angry over my two cousins.

182
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,350
It's not worth it.

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,240
Let me tell you two something.
A human...

184
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,390
Failures have their reasons.

185
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,320
Right back at you!

186
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,120
You know there are reasons, huh?

187
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
You have time

188
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,630
to mess with us, but why not go home

189
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,270
and take care of your father?

190
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
Go take care of him.

191
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,840
Yeah. Let's go.

192
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,120
Lay down the best carpet on the stage!

193
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,030
Are we really going to let them

194
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,510
take over the family business?

195
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,750
I won't let them.

196
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,960
Father, Mother,

197
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,150
we haven't dined together for a while.

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,940
Today, I had the kitchen

199
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,380
(Late Father, Xuan Shu, R.I.P.)
prepare your favorite dishes.

200
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
(Late Mother, De Anke, R.I.P.)

201
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,000
Xi Changkun has been captured.

202
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,320
The king's agreed to reopen the case.

203
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,180
You may now rest in peace.

204
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm sorry

205
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,710
it took me 12 years.

206
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,320
This toast is for you.

207
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
(Late Father, Xuan Shu, R.I.P.)

208
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,300
(Late Father, Xuan Shu, R.I.P.)

209
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,460
(Late Mother, De Anke, R.I.P.)

210
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,550
Young Master, a message from He Jiyao.

211
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,750
Xi Lin helped intercept

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
a big shipment of Yannan weapons.

213
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,790
They're on their way back.

214
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,630
Also,

215
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,120
we've got all the black iron crystal.

216
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,150
No loopholes, right?

217
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,620
We disguised ourselves as bandits

218
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,600
and robbed the entire He caravan.

219
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Let's go.

220
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,120
Robbed by bandits?

221
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,900
He caravan was attacked by bandits

222
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,860
at the Uncontrollable.

223
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,180
All of the goods were nabbed,

224
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,870
including the black iron crystal.

225
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,440
Luckily, I had it prepared.

226
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,550
Thanks to you
for getting Xixiang caravan to help.

227
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,910
The goods should reach Yannan soon.

228
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,750
My Lady, I'll take my leave.

229
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,670
You can find me at the west inn.

230
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,910
The weapons have arrived.

231
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
Thanks to you,

232
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,910
I could set the trap.

233
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,590
After Xi Changkun's convicted,

234
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,910
I'll go ask you for my reward.

235
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,390
You both have been through a lot lately.

236
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,870
Now you're finally back home.

237
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,850
Have some tea to warm yourselves up.

238
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,560
Dongyin,

239
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,480
the wind is strong.

240
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,910
Please close the door.

241
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,800
Yes, Miss.

242
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,110
Dongyin,

243
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,790
it is cold today.

244
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Here's a cup of warm tea for you.

245
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,270
Thank you, My Lady.

246
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,000
My tea is too hot.

247
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Let's swap the tea.

248
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,150
Why did you put poison?

249
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,470
Luo Qi!

250
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,390
Take her away.

251
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,280
Yes.

252
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,870
I spare you from torture

253
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,750
out of respect for your being Qiluo's maid.

254
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,440
If you care for her,

255
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,960
tell me the truth now.

256
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,120
Who gives you the orders?

257
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,790
Is it Xi Changkun?

258
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,200
Dongyin,

259
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,390
just tell us who is it.

260
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,790
Or you won't survive

261
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,480
the dungeon's punishments.

262
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,000
I heard your punishments are the harshest.

263
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,550
I'd like to have a try.

264
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,360
I thought you were obedient and kind,

265
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,840
but never imagined
you'd be this unyielding.

266
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Xi Changkun doesn't have anyone

267
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,750
as unyielding as you.

268
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,440
General, no need to guess.

269
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,150
No one gave me the order.

270
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,440
Young Master,

271
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,240
Xi Lin is back.
The king summons you.

272
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,870
Think it over carefully.

273
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,390
No one can save you if you stay silent.

274
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,560
Untie her.

275
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,590
Your Majesty,

276
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,120
with Xi Lin's help,

277
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,390
He Jiyao found

278
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,030
the hidden arsenal

279
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,630
and these weapons in it.

280
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,670
Now,

281
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,750
what do you have to say?

282
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,270
Your Majesty,

283
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
I have no idea how these weapons

284
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
were found in Xi's arsenal.

285
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,510
I suspect Xi Lin is framing me.

286
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,230
Your Majesty.

287
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,630
This brochure details the weapons

288
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,910
Xi Clan secretly manufactured

289
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,480
based on the designs

290
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,150
stolen from the Baigong's heir.

291
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,930
This went on for 12 years.

292
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,350
How can you prove these weapons are mine?

293
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,910
Because

294
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,830
you've ordered me to manage
the arsenal for 12 years.

295
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,640
Scoundrel!

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,200
And yet you still deny it?

297
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
This fragment

298
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,640
matches the material
of Xi Changkun's illegal weapons.

299
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,680
I've looked into this secretly.

300
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,200
This fragment is only for crossbows,

301
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,750
nothing else.

302
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,110
Where did you get it?

303
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,750
It was found

304
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,670
in my father's body.

305
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,510
Is that so?

306
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,550
Twelve years ago,

307
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,070
the weapons of Baigong's heir
surfaced in Beixuan.

308
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,310
My father investigated it under orders,

309
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,400
but you framed him

310
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,070
and had him killed in the Uncontrollable.

311
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,480
So what if I did?

312
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,310
Both of you deserved to die.

313
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,550
If your father hadn't pressured
the late king to centralize power,

314
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,110
I wouldn't have had to stockpile arms.

315
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,590
He even had the nerve
to investigate the arms case.

316
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,550
He brought all this

317
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,110
on himself.

318
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,070
And you, Xuan Lie,

319
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,550
I had planned to
move some weapons to Xixiang,

320
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,790
but you ruined it.

321
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
As long as you and your father are alive,

322
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,960
the Xi Clan can never grow stronger.

323
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,240
Xi Changkun!

324
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,960
You conspired with foreign forces,

325
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,590
manufactured illegal weapons,

326
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,510
and killed loyal officials.
Your crimes are unforgivable!

327
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,910
Guards,

328
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,190
put him in prison.

329
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,920
Execute him in ten days!

330
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,190
- Yes.
- Yes.

331
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,400
I wasn't sure what you'd like,

332
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,070
so I made something simple.

333
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,110
My Lady,

334
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,960
how do you know I poisoned the tea?

335
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,450
My family is in the silk business.

336
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,450
I've been around dyes since childhood,

337
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,160
so I'm sensitive to colors.

338
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,070
You might not see the difference,

339
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,750
but I can clearly tell.

340
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,590
I see.

341
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,920
You knew I wouldn't harm you,

342
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,160
so you switched cups with the general.

343
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,070
My Lady,

344
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,070
I'm so sorry.

345
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,790
Take care of yourself.

346
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,080
I'll go now.

347
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,110
My Lady,

348
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,590
aren't you going to ask me
who's behind this?

349
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,350
You'd rather be tortured

350
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,070
than tell me, wouldn't you?

351
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,920
He saved my life.

352
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,920
For him,

353
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,590
I'd do anything.

354
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,720
But he put you in danger.

355
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,350
Is it worth it?

356
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
He's worth it.

357
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,620
(Heavenly Prison)

358
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,590
You finally avenged your father.

359
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,160
From the day you killed him,

360
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,880
you should've known this day would come.

361
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,550
Your father deserved to die.

362
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,790
Don't you know illegal weapon manufacturing
condemns a whole clan?

363
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,590
Even if it's your own choice,

364
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,000
what about Xi Jixiu?

365
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,960
What do you want?

366
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Tell me everything

367
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,750
about my parents' case,

368
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,590
and I'll spare her life.

369
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,720
I can tell you,

370
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
but only if you promise
Xiu's safe return to Xi territory,

371
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,440
with food and shelter guaranteed.

372
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,390
Okay.

373
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,000
Back then, Beixuan had just stabilized.

374
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,070
Your father urged the late king
to centralize power.

375
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,270
He said that unifying the Five Clans

376
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,440
was the only way to strengthen Beixuan.

377
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,070
I feared the late king
would take control of my army,

378
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,160
so I bought designs from Baigong's heir,

379
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,590
- Move along.
- made weapons in the Uncontrollable,

380
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,270
and transported them to Xi.

381
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,510
Your father discovered it
and started investigating.

382
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,880
He blocked every pass.

383
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,480
We're ordered to inspect every caravan.

384
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,330
Sir...

385
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,480
Go ahead.

386
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,510
What are your goods?

387
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,440
Just fabric and silk.

388
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,870
Pass.

389
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,430
Thank you, Sir.

390
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,240
- Next one.
- Then he noticed the totem on the soldier.

391
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,400
It's the mark

392
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,470
- of Xi's Cangshui Army 12 years ago.
- Move.

393
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,260
(Leather City)

394
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,680
Fearing exposure,

395
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,350
I set an ambush

396
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
in the Uncontrollable.

397
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,350
Something's off.

398
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,160
- If it's just fabric and silk,
- Quickly!

399
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,790
the tracks wouldn't be so deep.

400
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,000
- Something's off!
- You, and you guys,

401
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,070
- follow me!
- Let's go.

402
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,070
My father died of
weapons of Baigong's heir.

403
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,350
What is your relationship Baigong's heir?

404
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,510
We were business partners.

405
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,640
He was a merchant

406
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
and wanted steady profits.

407
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,030
He sold me the designs and went all out

408
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,640
to get rid of anyone

409
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,720
who stood in the way of our deal.

410
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Have you ever met him?

411
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,830
They're meticulous
and never show themselves.

412
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,000
But he did give me the crossbow

413
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,350
that killed your father.

414
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,160
That's for real.

415
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,030
If I find out you lied to me,

416
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,240
I'll make you wish you were dead.

417
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,400
You lured me into the forest to kill me,

418
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,640
injured Luo Qi with an arrow,

419
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,880
and caused Mr. Sun's death.

420
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,240
All these crimes combined,

421
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,400
you could never afford to repay them.

422
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,200
I never did

423
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,440
any of those things.

424
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,670
Xuan Lie,

425
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,160
it seems I'm not the only one

426
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,510
who wants you dead.

427
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,060
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

428
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,190
Since you're here,

429
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,720
why leave so soon?

430
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,800
What's wrong?

431
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,950
Nothing.

432
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,680
I didn't want to disturb you.

433
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,680
How did the interrogation go?

434
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,150
Are you alright?

435
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,550
Did you go see Dongyin?

436
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,350
She still won't give up the mastermind.

437
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,880
I can still remember

438
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,270
the taste of the red bean soup

439
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,830
she made for me that snowy night.

440
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,480
It's only been a few days,

441
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,510
but it feels like a lifetime has passed.

442
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,890
One's mind is hard to fathom.

443
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,680
Those who were once close

444
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,080
might become

445
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
enemies one day.

446
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
If one day,

447
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,440
you and I become enemies,

448
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
what will you do then?

449
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,720
We...

450
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,310
We will never be enemies.

451
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,750
I was just kidding.

452
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,440
Why so serious?

453
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,400
Xi Changkun has confessed

454
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,000
that 12 years ago,

455
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,070
he conspired with a Yannan man
to kill my parents.

456
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,270
Did he tell you who it is?

457
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,000
He said

458
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,440
it was Baigong's heir.

459
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,830
Baigong's heir?

460
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,720
Baigong's heir sold

461
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,030
the weapon designs to him for money.

462
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,240
But he has never seen his true face.

463
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,110
Since he has never seen the heir's face,

464
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,400
anyone could impersonate Baigong's heir.

465
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,270
But my father

466
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,270
did die from a Baigong heir's weapon.

467
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,680
Besides, 12 years ago,

468
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,850
the heir wasn't yet
working for the King of Yannan.

469
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,480
Someone else could have obtained

470
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,400
the weapon designs,

471
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,550
made the weapons, and used them to kill.

472
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,680
We can't rule out that possibility.

473
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,510
If I go back to Yannan,

474
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,640
I'll find out who did it,

475
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,880
no matter who it is.

476
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,190
Qiluo,

477
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
it's not just Xi Changkun
who wants me dead.

478
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,110
There's someone else.

479
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,480
Haven't you found out who is it?

480
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,240
Not yet.

481
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,450
Luring me into the forest,

482
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,790
the attack at the festival,

483
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,790
and Mr. Sun's death,

484
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,350
Xi Changkun did none of it,

485
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,880
nor did Dongyin.

486
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,840
What did you say?

487
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,480
Xi Changkun claimed
Baigong's heir is his accomplice?

488
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,830
He must have done it deliberately.

489
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll find a chance to ask him.

490
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,720
Since he did it deliberately,

491
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,720
there's no point in questioning him.

492
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,880
I thought with Xi Changkun captured,

493
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,270
the case of Xuan Lie's parents
would finally be resolved.

494
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,750
Didn't expect him turns the tables on me.

495
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,950
My Lady,

496
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,590
if Xuan Lie finds out
you're Baigong's heir...

497
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,510
If he knows I'm Baigong's heir,

498
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,400
he would still trust me.

499
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,680
You still trust him so much?

500
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,270
Whether I trust him or not,

501
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,240
if that day ever comes,

502
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,680
there'll be no future for us.

503
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,760
By the way, Qimin.

504
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,200
I came here today
to ask you for one more favor.

505
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,280
Please, take a seat.

506
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,790
Besides Xi Changkun,

507
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,270
someone else wants Xuan Lie dead.

508
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,350
They've made several moves
during the contest,

509
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,070
seemingly targeting
the position of Wolf Lord.

510
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,590
If Xuan Lie dies,

511
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,070
who is most likely
to be the new Wolf Lord?

512
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,350
According to Beixuan's laws,

513
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,440
if the clan leader who ranks first
in the Hunting Event dies,

514
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,200
the position passes to the next in line.

515
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,830
Xuan ranks first,
and Luo is second.

516
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,550
If Luo Zhizhou wants...

517
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,680
It can't be Mr. Luo.

518
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,510
They've been best friends for years.

519
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,000
When it comes to power,

520
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,880
nothing is impossible.

521
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,310
My Lady, what can I do for you?

522
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,030
Since Xi Changkun insists
I'm his accomplice,

523
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,170
I suspect

524
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,270
that Yannan spy earlier is involved.

525
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
Go look into his whereabouts.

526
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,270
Xi Changkun has confessed

527
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,830
that Baigong's heir is his accomplice.

528
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,510
You shouldn't get involved
in Beixuan's politics anymore.

529
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,960
Once this is settled,

530
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,880
can you promise me

531
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,920
that you'll leave for Yannan?

532
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,550
After I uncover the person
behind Xi Changkun,

533
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,160
I'll think about it.

534
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,350
What?

535
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,790
How could my father be poisoned?

536
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,000
It can't be...

537
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,750
It can't be.

538
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,480
How could my father...

539
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,270
You're lying to me, aren't you?

540
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,350
We've checked everything.

541
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,440
No one went to visit him.

542
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,590
Only you had the guard deliver pastries.

543
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,750
And someone poisoned them.

544
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,510
That's impossible.

545
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,640
I made those pastries myself.

546
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Only Li Tao and I touched them.

547
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,000
How could they be poisoned?

548
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,080
Young Master,

549
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,110
Li Tao is dead.

550
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,270
- Step aside.
- Who did this?

551
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,480
I don't know. This is horrifying.

552
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,110
She got strangled.

553
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,510
Could this be left by the murderer?

554
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,720
Tell them to leave!

555
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,520
Young Master,

556
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,960
if I remember correctly,

557
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,550
Miss Jun has been wearing

558
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,960
this type of red bean bracelet recently.

559
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,480
The maid must've struggled desperately

560
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,590
before she died,

561
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,000
breaking the murder's bracelet.

562
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,240
Young Master,

563
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,020
if this bean truly
belongs to Miss Jun...

564
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,400
Wait until it's sorted out.

565
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,320
Go find out

566
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,830
who this maid met before she died,

567
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,240
and

568
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,880
don't tell anyone

569
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,480
about the red bean bracelet.

570
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

571
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,160
Didn't we just meet last night?

572
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,920
Why are you here so early this morning?

573
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,750
Your maid said

574
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,110
you went out early this morning.

575
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,630
Where did you go?

576
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,360
When did you start
caring about where I am?

577
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,230
I didn't see you around here,

578
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,360
so I was worried about you.

579
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,030
I went to the west of the city
to get some sesame cakes.

580
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,150
Since Dongyin isn't around,

581
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,320
I have to get whatever I want myself.

582
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,600
Want one?

583
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,070
Next time, let a maid take care of it.

584
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,800
It's cold. Don't catch a cold.

585
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,070
I saw the king's bulletin
on my way back.

586
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,360
The king has decreed

587
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,630
that Xi Changkun will be
publicly executed in ten days.

588
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,280
Your parents

589
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,710
can finally rest in peace.

590
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,000
Xi Changkun is dead.

591
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,070
He was poisoned in the prison.

592
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,030
Is there any clue?

593
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,440
Li Tao, Xi Jixiu's maid, did it.

594
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,400
But she must've been bribed.

595
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,110
In her room, we found poison traces

596
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,230
and a stash of silver.

597
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,510
Did you get anything from her?

598
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,630
She's dead too.

599
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,440
Xi Changkun was already condemned.

600
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,190
Whoever went this far to kill him

601
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,000
must have been his accomplice,

602
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400
worried he'd spill something,

603
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,590
and silenced him.

604
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,000
I agree.

605
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,390
Have some tea.

606
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,330
Where is your bracelet?

607
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,710
You've always worn it.

608
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,440
This morning at the West Street,

609
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,440
a crazy beggar

610
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,800
grabbed my hand

611
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,710
and broke my bracelet.

612
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,920
But luckily,

613
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,920
I picked up all the beads.

614
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
What's wrong?

615
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,950
Nothing.

616
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,110
Give me the beads,

617
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,230
and I'll have someone restring them for you.

618
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,000
After all, it's something special to you.

619
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,070
So, it seems

620
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,920
the red beads the maid
broke off before her death

621
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,280
must belong to Miss Jun.

622
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,720
Young Master,

623
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,880
there's something else.

624
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,230
You asked me to look into the Jun family.

625
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,420
I found something,
but I didn't think it mattered,

626
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
so I didn't report it.

627
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,030
But now...

628
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,320
What is it?

629
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,860
Years ago, Miss Jun's uncle
was a gambling addict.

630
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,760
He almost lost the Jun family business.

631
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,710
Fortunately,

632
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,710
the Juns suddenly
came into a large sum of silver,

633
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,920
saving the business.

634
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,670
This happened 12 years ago.

635
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,920
- If they...
- That's just your speculation.

636
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,670
Yes, it could be just a coincidence.

637
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,990
Maybe it isn't true.

638
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,190
There's one suspicious detail.

639
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,880
Today, Miss Jun said

640
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,920
a crazy beggar broke her bracelet.

641
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,550
But I searched West Street all day

642
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,880
and didn't find any beggar like that.

643
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,320
So Miss Jun must be lying.

644
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,800
Why are you looking for that beggar?

645
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,030
Are you hiding something from me?

646
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,720
General!

647
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,000
The king summons you.

648
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,840
I have to go to the palace.

649
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,550
