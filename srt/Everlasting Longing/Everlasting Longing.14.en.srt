17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Qiluo,

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,150
you are perceptive,

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,310
even seeing through Father's plans.

20
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,710
If you continue to assist me,

21
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,230
not just Xuan Lie,

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,790
even Beixuan

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,310
will be within my grasp.

24
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,200
With your ambitions,

25
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,640
Mr. Xi must be pleased.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,920
So I must make Father the Wolf Lord.

27
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,560
I want him to be proud of me.

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,150
Where is the ambush set for tomorrow?

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,710
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,710
Rest assured.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
There's an inevitable path

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,310
to the forest.

33
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,310
I've had men set up spike traps there.

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,560
The moment Xuan Lie passes,

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,630
they'll be activated.

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,630
Tomorrow,

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,910
the path will be his burial ground.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Qiluo,

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
don't stand with him anymore.

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,430
Miss Qiluo is my strategist now.

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,630
Isn't it normal that she stands with me?

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,210
- But you...
- I've arrived.

43
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,800
Mr. Xi, thank you.

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,080
All right. See you tomorrow.

45
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,470
I thought you didn't want to be near me.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,590
Why are you here?

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Qiluo,

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,470
I've been thinking.

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,010
Since you're going
to the Xi Clan for the mine,

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
after it's done,

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
you can still be with General Lie.

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
But you haven't reconciled.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,870
I'm afraid when you want to return,

54
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,680
General Lie might still be upset.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
Wouldn't that be a pity?

56
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,470
So today, I plan to help out.

57
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,560
I'll ease the tension between you two.

58
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,550
Zhaomin.

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,750
I know you're hesitant.

60
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,190
Don't worry.

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,190
I'm here for you.

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,630
I'll help you out.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,030
Just talk to him.

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,910
I'm sure you can work it out.

65
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,640
Zhaomin.

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,120
General Lie, Zhaomin seeks an audience.

67
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,750
Come in.

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
General Lie,

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
are you a good man?

70
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
If you are,

71
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,870
stop avoiding Qiluo.

72
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
She works with Xi Mo now.

73
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,920
It's so disturbing.

74
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,080
I can't stand it.

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,870
How could you take it?

76
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,960
I can't, either.

77
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,430
Then it's easy.

78
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,160
Look, I brought Qiluo here

79
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,240
to mediate between you two.

80
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,000
Since you don't want to

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,270
see them together,

82
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,310
you should reconcile with Qiluo.

83
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,270
Sir, just as you predicted,

84
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,430
your brother's been found.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
Everything is now arranged.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
Just waiting for your command.

87
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Where are you going?

88
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,270
I haven't finished.

89
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,580
Qiluo and I have something to do.

90
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,120
What's going on with you?

91
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,560
We should split up

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,630
to avoid Xi Mo's suspicion.

93
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,350
Princess,

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,190
could you do us a favor?

95
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,790
So beautiful.

96
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,190
There's more.

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
It is... good.

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,560
That's Xi Manor in Royal City.

99
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,070
Woshan discovered long ago

100
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,430
the blast wasn't natural.

101
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,290
I suspect it was Xi Changkun's doing,

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,720
but I couldn't find any evidence.

103
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,000
Today, I went to his tent

104
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,070
and took his pass token.

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,360
Woshan entered his manor with it

106
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,040
and found the gunpowder stash.

107
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,460
When no one was around...

108
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,920
You blew it up.

109
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,390
That's ruthless.

110
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,390
He almost got you killed in the mine.

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,430
I must teach him a lesson.

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,240
His target is you.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,040
Not me.

114
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,470
By the way,

115
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,390
tomorrow,

116
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,800
when you reach the entrance,

117
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
you must be careful.

118
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,430
Xi Mo has set up spike traps there.

119
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,680
That's deadly.

120
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
You're ruthless, too.

121
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,070
That's why I keep reminding you.

122
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,360
You're worried about me?

123
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,120
Is it that hard to admit?

124
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,160
It's over. Let's go back.

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,510
Don't leave. There's more.

126
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,270
More?

127
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,120
♪We come from a time of chaos♪

128
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,190
It's so beautiful here.

129
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,120
What kind of flower is this?

130
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
It's a blue snowflower,

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
blooming once every decade.

132
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,510
I've never seen them bloom like this.

133
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,270
Seems like we're quite lucky.

134
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,230
You know,

135
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,750
there's a legend in Beixuan.

136
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,600
If you make a wish
in a sea of blue flowers,

137
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,040
it will come true.

138
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,430
Make a wish.

139
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,470
I, Xuan Lie,

140
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,950
vow by the sun and moon:

141
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,870
Jun Qiluo shall be my
only wife in this lifetime.

142
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,480
If I break this vow,

143
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
may I face endless doom.

144
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:29,580
♪Allows you to camp in my heart♪

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
Father.

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,750
This wine is from Cangzhou.

147
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,960
Tomorrow, when we triumph,

148
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,270
we will celebrate here

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
with this fine wine.

150
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,360
How are you sure we'll win?

151
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,870
Qiluo has planned everything.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,960
Not just the contest,

153
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,440
even the Wolf Lord's position

154
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,550
belongs to the Xi Clan for sure.

155
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,200
Answer me.

156
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,600
What's the story with the official seal?

157
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,110
Father,

158
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,510
I made a deal with Qiluo privately.

159
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,840
She made Xuan Lie lose the first contest,

160
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,720
and I allowed her to transport
some black iron crystal.

161
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,860
Since she fulfilled her part,

162
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,600
I can't break my promise to her.

163
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,560
Otherwise,

164
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,910
she won't work for us in the future.

165
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
Did she make you steal the official seal?

166
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,150
She had no idea the seal was at the manor.

167
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,080
I figured

168
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,810
you wouldn't take
something that important

169
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,720
with you,

170
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,750
so, I went back to the manor.

171
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,840
Usually, you're not so meticulous.

172
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,320
Why do you think so much

173
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,360
when she's around?

174
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,510
Perhaps because of her carefulness.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,720
These days, I've been close with her

176
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,910
and learned a bit.

177
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
Well,

178
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,750
she will cause the death of you.

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,750
Why do you say that, Father?

180
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,790
That woman is full of tricks.

181
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,550
Don't believe anything she says.

182
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,670
In Liangzhou,

183
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,240
haven't you suffered enough?

184
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,600
She offers you small favors

185
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,910
to gain benefits.

186
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,370
Yet you speak for her all the time.

187
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,750
How can I be at ease?

188
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
But she did put Xuan Lie at a disadvantage.

189
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,120
How do you know they're not acting

190
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
to deceive you?

191
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,990
Oh no.

192
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,790
I've told her tomorrow's plan.

193
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,360
If she's deceiving me, then...

194
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,790
You fool.

195
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,840
- Sir.
- What's wrong?

196
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
The manor got blown up.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
What?

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
How did that happen?

199
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,300
It's under investigation.

200
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
Maybe the gunpowder for mining

201
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,910
- exploded.
- No way.

202
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,600
I stocked it in a damp room

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,630
facing north.

204
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,470
How could it explode?

205
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,040
My token.

206
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,110
It's Xuan Lie.

207
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Mr. Xi.

208
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,120
My lady is not available.

209
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,600
Is she unavailable or absent?

210
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,030
What do you mean?

211
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,160
Step aside.

212
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,750
Mr. Xi.

213
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,270
Let me see if she's really here.

214
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,110
Mr. Xi.

215
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,160
You can't go in.

216
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,270
She is bathing.

217
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,510
She...

218
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,960
Mr. Xi, look,

219
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,240
she is upset.

220
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,510
My lady values honor most.

221
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,030
Mr. Xi, do not ruin her reputation.

222
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,260
Qiluo,

223
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,390
I didn't mean to intrude.

224
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,600
I need to confirm a few things.

225
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,720
Mr. Xi, please leave.

226
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,720
If you insist on staying,

227
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,480
it's going to cause a scandal.

228
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,030
I'll come back later.

229
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,630
Stop looking.

230
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,910
He left.

231
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,390
Good thing

232
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,230
he didn't intrude.

233
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,440
I had my fist ready for him.

234
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,550
Are you still mad at me?

235
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,390
I had urgent business last night.

236
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,680
What gave you the audacity
to barge into my tent

237
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,870
so disrespectfully?

238
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,360
Last night, Xi Manor caught fire,

239
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,000
and Father suspects it's Xuan Lie's doing.

240
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,150
You and he...

241
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,150
You said it was Xuan Lie's doing.

242
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,550
What does that have to do with me?

243
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,120
After returning to my tent,

244
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,150
I didn't leave again.

245
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,120
Mr. Xi,

246
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,600
don't accuse me of false charges.

247
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,320
I lost my temper last night.

248
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
I broke the rules.

249
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,680
I apologize to you.

250
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,960
The contest is near.

251
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,200
We'll settle this afterward.

252
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,550
I heard the Xi Manor had an explosion.

253
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,440
It caused quite a commotion.

254
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,360
Have you discovered the reason?

255
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,600
General,

256
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,870
don't listen to the nonsense.

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,480
Things are dry in winter.

258
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
Fires are normal occurrences.

259
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,670
There was no explosion.

260
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,200
Mr. Xi, you're right.

261
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,240
An explosion requires gunpowder.

262
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,510
Your manor isn't a gunpowder storehouse.

263
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,750
How could it explode?

264
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,750
It must be exaggerated rumors.

265
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,590
General,

266
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,240
I suggest you focus on the contest.

267
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,870
Last round, your clan got only three plaques.

268
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,550
If you lose the next round,

269
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,240
the Wolf Lord's position
will be out of reach.

270
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,550
Thank you for the reminder.

271
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,740
(Su Sun Luo Xi Xuan)

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,320
The second round
is the hunting exercise.

273
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,550
It lasts for four hours.

274
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,670
Each clan sends five participants.

275
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,600
This contest tests

276
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,360
strength and reflexes.

277
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,480
The result is based on the prey's weight.

278
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,360
If the weight is equal,

279
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,750
the one with more prey wins.

280
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,320
The trap is already set.

281
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,870
Why should we watch it here?

282
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,870
Winning the contest is key.

283
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,320
Leave the contest to Father.

284
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,320
I just want to see Xuan Lie fall.

285
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,390
Let's go.

286
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,080
Was it you?

287
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,030
Have you been deceiving me?

288
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,870
What do you mean?

289
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,080
Father was right.

290
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,630
Your words are worthless.

291
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,550
Luckily, I was ready for both.

292
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Xuan Lie is doomed today.

293
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,990
Let go.

294
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,080
Where are you going?

295
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,230
Jun Qiluo.

296
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,120
Don't follow me.

297
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
What are you doing?

298
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,710
Stop it.

299
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,360
Don't try to warn Xuan Lie.

300
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Jun Qiluo, stop!

301
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,000
Xuan Lie, it's an ambush!

302
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,710
Jun Qiluo!

303
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,270
I will end you!

304
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,310
He's committed many wrongs.

305
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,030
In the end, he harmed himself.

306
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,550
What a pity.

307
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,590
Let's go.

308
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Young Master.

309
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,430
Young Master.

310
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,630
Miss Jun, why are you here?

311
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,160
Earlier, Xi Mo set a trap,

312
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,240
intending to harm Qiluo in the woods.

313
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,030
- What?
- Anyone hurt?

314
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,080
No harm done.

315
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,430
He Jiyao,

316
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,000
escort Qiluo out of the woods.

317
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,350
Make sure no one sees you.

318
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,550
Especially those from Xi.

319
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,590
Understood.

320
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,290
Luo Qi and I will continue the contest

321
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
while there's still time.

322
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
We can't surrender easily.

323
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,930
Once out of the woods,
head straight to the tent.

324
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,870
And remember,

325
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
we know nothing

326
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
about Xi Mo's death today.

327
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,800
Be careful.

328
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
My Lord.

329
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,960
Why was Xi Mo here?

330
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,240
My Lady...

331
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,790
Are you worried about Jun Qiluo?

332
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,790
No, it's not that.

333
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,640
Xi Mo came with Miss Jun.

334
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,680
Now, only Xi Mo is seen.

335
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,440
I suspect

336
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,960
Xi Mo's death is her doing.

337
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,590
Your first reaction betrayed you.

338
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,550
I heard she saved you when you were hurt.

339
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,790
She even carried you back, ignoring status.

340
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,720
Compassion will prevail.

341
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,720
If it stirred compassion in you,

342
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I can understand.

343
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,000
She saved me,

344
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,920
and I owe her.

345
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,000
My Lord,

346
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,960
your opponent is General Lie.

347
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,600
It has nothing to do with Miss Jun.

348
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,030
Let me kill him for you.

349
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,870
No.

350
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,960
I never intended to harm Lie.

351
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,550
Even if we share the same goal,

352
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,110
fighting would only lead

353
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,880
to our mutual destruction.

354
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,960
That's why I've been trying

355
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,680
to stop him from competing.

356
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Your foot is injured,

357
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,110
so don't join me this time.

358
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,880
Thanks for your concern.

359
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,920
But the Xi Clan
has been ambushing in the forest.

360
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,440
You were worried about exposure

361
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,110
and haven't had time to plan.

362
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,350
No worries.

363
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,070
Consider this

364
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,400
as an open rivalry between me and Lie.

365
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,520
Your Majesty,

366
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,960
time is almost up.

367
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,720
Send someone to remind them.

368
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,390
Yes.

369
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,910
Mother,

370
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,480
you're making my hand sweaty.

371
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,350
It's much warmer

372
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,030
at noon.

373
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,880
Your riding skill's improved.

374
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,640
You're giving it your all.

375
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,920
They've caught so much.

376
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,400
Don't worry.

377
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,350
Keep practicing more,

378
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,350
and you will get better.

379
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,910
My Lord.

380
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,920
Mo's not with you?

381
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,550
I haven't seen him.

382
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,920
Take it back first.

383
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,800
The Xuan Clan won.

384
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,370
General Lie's prey weighs the most.

385
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,040
Your Majesty,

386
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,160
the Xuan Clan won.

387
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,880
General Lie's prey weighs the most.

388
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,340
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

389
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,200
Excellent.

390
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,590
Next is the Xi Clan, followed by Sun Clan,

391
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,030
Luo Clan, and Su Clan.

392
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,350
Yet Mr. Xi hasn't come back.

393
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
What?

394
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,400
Mr. Xi is still in the forest?

395
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,720
It's reported

396
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,720
Xi Mo hasn't returned,

397
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,510
so Mr. Xi entered the woods again

398
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
to look for him.

399
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,550
He hasn't returned yet.

400
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,070
Announce my decree,

401
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,030
the curfew starts earlier tonight.

402
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,830
No one is to wander without reason.

403
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,720
Send more people to assist Mr. Xi.

404
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes.

405
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,720
Mo!

406
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,550
Mo!

407
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,480
Mo...

408
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,400
Mo!

409
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,430
Mo...

410
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,350
Mo...

411
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,390
Mo.

412
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,510
Mo.

413
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,110
It's Xuan Lie

414
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,110
and Jun Qiluo.

415
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,430
Mo,

416
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,350
I will avenge you.

417
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,860
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)

418
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,350
Jun Feifan is a woman?

419
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,830
That's right.

420
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Do you have proof?

421
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,190
Chancellor,

422
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,680
I've captured Jun Qiluo's nanny.

423
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,640
This is enough to prove

424
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,480
that Jun Qiluo is indeed Jun Feifan.

425
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,950
Chancellor,

426
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,310
what do you think of this news?

427
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,480
What reward do you want?

428
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,270
Please help me become Jun Manager.

429
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
Once this news spreads,

430
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,270
she won't be a threat to you.

431
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,750
Jun Chengliu is now unconscious.

432
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,640
The Jun family's enterprises

433
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,160
are almost under your control, right?

434
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,560
Chancellor,

435
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,960
I, Jun Yujue,

436
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,830
will become Jun Manager rightfully.

437
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,920
Also, I must

438
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,790
crush Jun Feifan.

439
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,870
Very well.

440
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,880
I am aware of it.

441
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,160
Proceed as you see fit.

442
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
Thank you, Chancellor.

443
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,840
Chancellor,

444
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,960
I shall take my leave.

445
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,150
Mr. Zheng.

446
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,520
Chancellor,

447
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,550
do you truly intend to help Jun Yujue?

448
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,400
What surprises me is

449
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,680
Jun Feifan is actually Jun Qiluo.

450
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,160
Jun Feifan is Baigong's heir.

451
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,070
As Jun Qiluo,

452
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,720
she has stayed in Beixuan for long.

453
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,920
She might inevitably know things

454
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,110
she shouldn't be aware of.

455
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,310
Set off to Beixuan to find her.

456
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,590
If she doesn't follow the rules,

457
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,510
just end her there directly.

458
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,400
As for the King...

459
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,920
Baigong's heir belongs to His Majesty.

460
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,920
If we condemn her

461
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,680
for betraying Yannan,

462
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,830
the king will handle it himself.

463
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
Has the crystal been moved?

464
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,160
I've arranged for them to split up.

465
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,350
One group will go by water,

466
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,310
and the other by land.

467
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,000
Be more cautious lately.

468
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,720
Xi Mo died on the field.

469
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,750
Tonight, Beixuan will not be peaceful.

470
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,930
My Lady,

471
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,590
why don't we leave now?

472
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,550
It's not the right time.

473
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,350
Where have you been?

474
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,750
I blow the whistle every day.

475
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,880
Why did you never show up?

476
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,110
What for?

477
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Even if there's nothing,

478
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,440
you must stay close for safety.

479
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,350
The venue is heavily guarded tonight.

480
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,000
If you bump into someone,

481
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,480
you'll be in danger.

482
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,230
I'm handling matters for Miss Jun.

483
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,640
No one will harm me.

484
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,920
Miss Jun.

485
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,110
That's all you think about.

486
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,070
You just ignore me.

487
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,150
I told you

488
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,030
whenever I blow the whistle,
you must appear.

489
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,640
Otherwise, our deal is off.

490
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,540
Mr. Shao.

491
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,640
It's no longer safe here.

492
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,440
Tonight, I'll sneak in and get her out.

493
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
You'll back me up.

494
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,240
If Beixuan's troops notice,
they will send pursuers.

495
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,830
Kill them all and leave no loose ends.

496
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,910
Understood.

497
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,630
(My Lady,)

498
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,000
(I will take you back to Yannan.)

499
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,080
My Lady.

500
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,150
My Lady?

501
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,080
Qimin?

502
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,960
You did this?

503
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,520
Where are you taking me?

504
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,350
Back to Yannan.

505
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,030
How dare you act on your own?

506
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,870
Stop.

507
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,070
You said,

508
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,640
once we get the crystal, we'll leave.

509
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,440
Now that we have it,

510
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,200
we have no reason to stay.

511
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,720
I am already with Xuan Lie.

512
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,670
Qimin.

513
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,590
Brother.

514
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,870
Brother.

515
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,950
Brother.

516
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,800
Father.

517
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,670
Xiu,

518
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,960
mark my words.

519
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,270
Xuan Lie and Jun Qiluo

520
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,200
caused your brother's death.

521
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,110
From now on, they are your enemies.

522
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Impossible.

523
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
It can't be General Lie.

524
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,920
It must be Jun Qiluo.

525
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,880
Neither of them is innocent.

526
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,720
From now on,

527
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,350
you must not see Xuan Lie.

528
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,590
Do you hear me?

529
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,480
Lie,

530
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,790
Xi Mo is dead.

531
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,720
Are you involved?

532
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,590
While trying to kill Qiluo,

533
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,880
Xi Mo triggered his own trap and died.

534
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,160
It's that Yannan woman again.

535
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,030
Your Majesty,

536
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,160
it has nothing to do with Qiluo.

537
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,550
She only pretended

538
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,030
to join the Xi Clan to help me.

539
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,350
This trap was set by Xi Mo.

540
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,400
He seeks my demise.

541
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,730
Luo Qi requests an audience.

542
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,670
Your Majesty.

543
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,440
Young Master, Miss Jun's missing.

544
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,720
Xi Mo just died.

545
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,200
Yet this Yannan woman vanished during curfew.

546
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,840
Lie,

547
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,680
how can I plead for you?

548
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,040
Fine.

549
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,790
If she really assists you,

550
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,070
I'll spare her for now.

551
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,880
Go find her.

552
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,070
Don't cause trouble during the contest.

553
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,800
Yes.

554
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,560
Young Master.

555
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,750
When did this happen?

556
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,000
Dongyin reported

557
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,280
she had only gone to get a bowl,

558
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,260
and Miss Jun disappeared.

559
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,080
Xuan Lie.

560
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,350
Qimin, stop now.

561
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,390
If Xuan Lie gets you,

562
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,510
he won't let you off easily.

563
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,480
(Arrow in black.)

564
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,030
The arrows are poisoned. Be careful.

565
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,270
Who are those people?

566
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,430
Qimin.

567
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,590
Qiluo.

568
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,510
Stop them now.

569
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,320
Stop them!

570
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,160
- My Lady!
- Qiluo!

571
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,880
Threatening me with your life?

572
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,880
You know me.

573
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,870
Jun Qiluo,

574
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,150
he poisoned the arrow.

575
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,510
He's trying to kill me.

576
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,750
- Drop the knife.
- Let him go.

577
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,760
I want you to let him go.

578
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,320
Drop your weapons.

579
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,240
Jun Qiluo.

580
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,480
You risked your life
to save Shao Qimin?

581
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,280
Qimin is my family

582
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,840
and my friend.

583
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,880
I must save him.

584
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
But he is a man

585
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,840
who has feelings for you.

586
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,360
Why can't you
be with me wholeheartedly?

587
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,590
Wholeheartedly?

588
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,670
How about you?

589
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,320
You cooperate for the crystal,

590
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,070
but you have your own motives.

591
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,870
Am I right?

592
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,190
You've never been wholehearted with me,

593
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,230
so why demand it from me?

594
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,920
Qimin's been by my side since little,

595
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,630
if I had feelings for him,

596
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,190
I wouldn't have been with you.

597
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,510
If we don't trust each other,

598
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,000
there's no point in being together.

599
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,070
Let go.

600
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,800
Let me go.

601
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
If you leave, I'll kill him.

602
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,420
Don't you dare.

603
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,150
Stop looking. Let's go.
