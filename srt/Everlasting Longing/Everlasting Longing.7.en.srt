17
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,990
My mother is from Yannan.

18
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm half Yannan, half Beixuan.

19
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,550
So, I'm not welcome here.

20
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,300
I won't wear it anymore.

21
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,390
Why not?

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,420
The weaving of the Jun family

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,650
is famous all over the world.

24
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,140
Others would

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,860
be craving for it.

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,700
Right, General?

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,900
Don't be afraid.

28
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,420
I am a merchant from the Jun family.

29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,020
My Lady,

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,830
you are from the Jun family?

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,700
My mother often told me about them
when she was alive.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,860
Their manager, Jun Feifan,

33
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,830
with his incredible business acumen,

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,740
made their business the No. 1 in Yannan.

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,860
He is truly admirable.

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,760
Sorry for my being talkative.

37
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,080
I didn't expect Mr. Feifan's reputation

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,930
to spread so widely.

39
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,740
Mr. Jun is naturally the best.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,990
You've spoken of his legend all the way,

41
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,140
but I think you're also outstanding,

42
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,390
not at all inferior to Jun Feifan.

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,390
You flatter me, General.

44
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,180
How could I compare to Mr. Feifan?

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,820
I had the servants prepare

46
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,250
Beixuan's special delicacies for you.

47
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,300
Have a try.

48
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,670
Why are you so kind to me, General?

49
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,390
It's just hospitality.

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,040
Don't worry about it.

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,260
What else do you need?

52
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,790
I'll have the servants prepare it.

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,270
Seeing these Beixuan dishes

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,400
reminds me of the red bean soup
from Yannan.

55
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,020
In Yannan, red beans are also called
longing beans.

56
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,070
They carry our longing for loved ones.

57
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,110
Red bean soup.

58
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,850
Young Master,

59
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,620
the guys from the Xuanyu Army's
Rite of Passage

60
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,420
are all strong and tall.

61
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,390
With the support of the Danyang Army

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,020
and the Qingtang Army,

63
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,990
this time, we'll surely
get the Wolf Lord's

64
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,020
Pentagram Military Token.

65
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,660
- Young Master.
- Have a look!

66
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,710
What are you looking for?

67
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,240
Where is the black market here?

68
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,710
The black market?

69
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,910
It's ahead at the fork in the road.

70
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,430
Everyone,

71
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,590
General Lie is here.

72
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,180
Bring out the good stuff.

73
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,830
Hurry up.

74
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,710
Don't move. Put your hands down.

75
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,550
You.

76
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,590
It's you.

77
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,430
Put it down.

78
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,460
Why laugh? Don't move.

79
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,220

81
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,350
Don't move.

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,550
Manager, do you have red beans?

83
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,910
How about red bean seeds?

84
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,070
General,

85
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,150
this is all I have.

86
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,380
Are these the good products from Yannan?

87
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,300
(Good products from Yannan)

88
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,140
What is this?

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,590
Who hung the sign here?

90
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,030
General, these are good products
from Beixuan.

91
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
It's a misunderstanding.

92
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,890
Young Master, why don't you
wait outside for a while?

93
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,990
I'll ask them.

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,670
Maybe after you leave,

95
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,350
they'll have it.

96
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,110
Since you promised this,

97
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,030
if there's nothing,

98
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,820
you'll be held accountable.

99
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,390
Why are you sighing?

100
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,580
Any red beans?

101
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,180
Do you have them?

102
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
(Xuan Mansion)

103
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,420
This is the longing jade necklace

104
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,020
made of Beixuan's most precious
black jade and Yannan red beans.

105
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,300
It suits you perfectly.

106
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,620
Where did you find
these Yannan red beans?

107
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,470
There's nothing I can't find
in Central Town.

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,110
What? You don't like it?

109
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,460
I like it,

110
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,030
but compared to this necklace,

111
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,990
I'm more used
to wearing the trade token.

112
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
Can't my gifts beat

113
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,500
the ones from Jun Feifan?

114
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,310
Besides,

115
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,840
since it's a token of our pact,

116
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,860
how can you take it back?

117
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,500
It's getting late.

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,870
Rest early.

119
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,300
(Xuanwu Palace)

120
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,060
I've been waiting for your return
for a long time.

121
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,550
Today, I specially prepared
fine wine and dishes.

122
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,870
Come on.

123
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,740
Let's go back to the carefree old days.

124
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,670
Today, let's enjoy drinking.

125
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,030
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

126
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,770
This time, your journey to Liangzhou

127
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,420
not only helped the affected victims

128
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,260
Lie also gained the support
of the Sun Clan.

129
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,990
I must reward you heavily.

130
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,260
It's thanks to your consideration
for the people,

131
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,670
or the commoners might have complaints.

132
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,230
Lie's always been loyal to Your Majesty.

133
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,710
Whatever your commands,

134
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,290
Lie will do his best to accomplish.

135
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,640
I know Lie's character

136
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,950
very well.

137
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,500
Cheers.

138
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,430
Now that Lie has the support of the Sun

139
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,140
and your clan,

140
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,830
I am at ease.

141
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,780
Some time ago, the Queen Mother
mentioned your marriage.

142
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,190
You were out fighting wars before,

143
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,530
but now that you have time,

144
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,820
and the Hunting Event is near,

145
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,620
you should think about it.

146
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,340
Especially you.

147
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,860
The ladies of other clans will enter

148
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,830
the Royal City in a few days.

149
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,830
You must plan ahead.

150
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,810
Your Majesty,

151
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,720
I suddenly feel some discomfort
in my stomach.

152
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,590
I'll be back shortly.

153
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,230
Did you find the Baigong's heir
on this trip to the Uncontrollable?

154
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,950
Jun Feifan is not in the caravan,

155
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,740
but I've captured his maid.

156
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,150
Perhaps we can get some info

157
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,990
about Jun Feifan from her.

158
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,670
His maid?

159
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,110
It's been several days now.

160
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,500
Have you found any clues?

161
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,380
This maid is clever and resourceful.

162
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,860
She refuses to reveal
Jun Feifan's whereabouts.

163
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,230
I'm still investigating.

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,140
I think you should be cautious.

165
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,770
After all, she's a foreign woman.

166
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,710
What if she came here
with ulterior motives?

167
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,070
Rest assured.

168
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,950
I've spent many days with her

169
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,380
and I know her well.

170
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,540
She has the Jun Trade Token

171
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,380
and can facilitate trade
between the Sun and the Juns.

172
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,230
These signs indicate

173
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,860
that she must be connected
with Jun Feifan.

174
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,540
As long as I keep her by my side,

175
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,660
I can find Jun Feifan's whereabouts.

176
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,950
Glad you have a plan.

177
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,810
Don't let this ruin the bigger picture.

178
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,700
Understood.

179
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,620
(Xuanyu, son of Xuan Xu)

180
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,460
Take it.

181
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,340
Take it.

182
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,550
Take it.

183
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,790
Yi,

184
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,760
today, I'll definitely

185
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,710
make you lose miserably.

186
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,500
(Xuan Yi, youngest son of Xuan Xu)

187
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,830
Yu, feel free to bring it on.

188
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,830
Let's get on.

189
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,030
Yu,

190
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
it hurts.

191
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,230
A real man should be able

192
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,780
to endure a little pain.

193
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,140
If you can't,
how will you help me in the future?

194
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,860
Let's try again.

195
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,710
Sure.

196
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,590
You hurt me!

197
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,990
You hurt me first.

198
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,540
I'm your older brother.

199
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm allowed to hurt you.

200
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,430
Who allowed you to hurt me?

201
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
Yu, you just said

202
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,380
a real man should never fear pain.

203
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,740
Where are you going?

204
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,860
Prince Yu is too rough.

205
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,380
What if he hurts Prince Yi?

206
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,670
Are you crazy?

207
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,260
Prince Yu is the Queen's son.

208
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,860
Just make sure he doesn't suffer.

209
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,990
Don't meddle.

210
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,580
Stop.

211
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,660
(Li Fanyin, the King's Consort)

212
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,470
Are you alright?

213
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,350
Don't worry, Mother.

214
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,710
I'm fine.

215
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,780
The Queen is here.

216
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,700
Mother.

217
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,500
Come on, get up.

218
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,100
Yu.

219
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,620
Yi hurt me.

220
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,940
(Xiao Qianjiao, Queen of Beixuan)

221
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

222
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,920
It was Yi who hurt me here.

223
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,190
I only hit back in self-defense.

224
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,030
No.

225
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,830
Yu hit me first.

226
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,670
Be quiet.

227
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,990
Mother, I'm not lying.

228
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,860
Are you saying that Yu
should apologize to you?

229
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,010
No, it's Yi's fault

230
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,510
for being disrespectful to Prince Yu.

231
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,830
Yi should apologize.

232
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,660
Yi, apologize to your brother.

233
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,500
Mother,

234
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,350
I really didn't lie.

235
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,070
I told you to apologize to Prince Yu.

236
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,460
Hurry.

237
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,380
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,020
I shouldn't have hit you.

239
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,710
Your Majesty,

240
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,710
Yi is too young to be sensible.

241
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,210
He was disrespectful to Prince Yu.

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,780
Please don't blame him.

243
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,830
That's enough.

244
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,020
As the older brother,

245
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,620
Yu won't hold it against Yi.

246
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,230
Let's end it here.

247
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,700
Yu,

248
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,840
let's go back to the Palace.

249
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,310
Yi,

250
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,350
don't blame me.

251
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,740
I know it's not your fault.

252
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,710
The Queen and Prince Yu
are really too much.

253
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,190
How many times has this happened?

254
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,110
Prince Yi always suffers.

255
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,950
Xin,

256
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,740
take Yi back first.

257
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,220
Yes.

258
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,140
Greetings, Mr. Luo.

259
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,170
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

260
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,670
Did the Queen

261
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,350
make things hard for you again?

262
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,110
It's just kids playing around.

263
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,430
This is Xixiang's milk cake,
Prince Yi's favorite.

264
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,740
Please keep it for him.

265
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,910
Your Ladyship, you need not worry.

266
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,350
It's getting late.

267
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,660
There are few people around

268
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,310
except for a few guards.

269
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,240
Since you've caught up with me,

270
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,780
I agree to your request.

271
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,030
You can go to my father
and propose to me.

272
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,790
I've prepared the betrothal gifts.

273
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,100
I was just waiting for you to say it.

274
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,990
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

275
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,900
No one in Beixuan

276
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,950
has ever treated Yi so well.

277
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,200
You've suffered in the Palace
for all these years.

278
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
He married you

279
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,140
but has never treated you right.

280
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,290
My Lord, don't worry about me.

281
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,800
This is the fate
that Yi and I must bear.

282
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,310
For now,

283
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,900
I only hope for the day
when the clouds part.

284
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,140
The Hunting Event is near.

285
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,500
Has everything been prepared?

286
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,740
I heard you helped General Lie

287
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,440
in Liangzhou

288
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,990
gain the support of Mr. Sun Ba.

289
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,140
Rest assured.

290
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,020
Lie is the best candidate
for the Wolf Lord in the King's heart.

291
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,830
He also regards me as a brother.

292
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,710
No matter what,

293
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,430
I will protect you and Yi.

294
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,380
In all of Beixuan,

295
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,780
I only trust you.

296
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,340
Father,

297
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,860
why has the King summoned us

298
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,020
to the Palace this early?

299
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,660
Does he know about Xi Da?

300
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,780
You're always so impatient.

301
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,950
Xi Da's body was found
in the Uncontrollable,

302
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,140
but Xuan Lie didn't find any evidence.

303
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,430
Currently, the Xi and Xuan
are the strongest.

304
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,780
The King has decided on Xuan Lie
as the Wolf Lord.

305
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,860
He's now wondering

306
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,580
what benefits he can offer us

307
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,580
to achieve the peace he desires.

308
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,310
Father,

309
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,500
there's something I don't know
whether to say or not.

310
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,670
Are you worried

311
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,230
about us being helpless since the Xuan

312
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,060
are supported by the Luo and Sun?

313
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,990
No one knows me better than you.

314
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,670
The Hunting Event is around the corner.

315
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,540
I'm truly worried.

316
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,060
We can't kill Xuan Lie
in the Royal City.

317
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,140
Father,

318
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,470
we can't bear the crime
of killing a Clan Leader.

319
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,630
But if we can stop Xuan Lie

320
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,470
from participating in the Hunting Event,

321
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,230
Sun Ba and Mr. Luo Zhizhou
can't do anything

322
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,300
even with their armies.

323
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,380
(Xuan Mansion)

324
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,900
(Late Father, Xuan Shu, R.I.P.;
Late Mother, De Anke, R.I.P.)

325
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,100
Mother, don't worry.

326
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,780
Father, don't worry.

327
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,150
I will become
the No. 1 General of Beixuan,

328
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,540
fighting side by side with you both

329
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,880
to protect the people of Beixuan.

330
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,820
Well said.

331
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,500
Father, Mother,

332
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,430
the Wolf Lord Election
will take place soon.

333
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,910
Please bless me, so I can win

334
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,580
and fulfill your last wishes

335
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,010
of uniting the Five Clans

336
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,670
and protecting Beixuan.

337
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,540
(Late Father, Xuan Shu, R.I.P.;
Late Mother, De Anke, R.I.P.)

338
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,100
(The Baigong Crafts says)

339
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,740
(with a magnet above,
copper and gold lie below;)

340
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,390
(with water to the side,
crystals lie beneath.)

341
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,500
(If black iron crystals
truly appear in the Royal City,)

342
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,300
(perhaps I can find them
based on this clue.)

343
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,260
Sachets! Little trinkets!

344
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,740
Sachets! Little trinkets!

345
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,580
Scented materials!

346
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,260
Scented materials!

347
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,740
Herbs!

348
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,150
This is not what I want.

349
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,230
Herbs!

350
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,430
This place is very open.

351
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,150
It doesn't seem to have any mines.

352
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,330
What are you doing here?

353
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,530
I heard today is the anniversary
of your parents' death.

354
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,670
Are these two woodcarvings
what they left for you?

355
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,710
Look, Father.

356
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,910
I'm done.

357
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,150
Not bad. There's progress.

358
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,340
Father,

359
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,500
why do you always bring me here?

360
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,060
It's so cold here.

361
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,060
This is the highest point
in the Royal City.

362
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,350
The highest place is always cold.

363
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,670
The higher the place, the colder it is,

364
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,260
and the fewer people
can accompany you to the top.

365
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,710
When you climb to a higher position,

366
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,390
you must pay the price.

367
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,630
This price may be someone else's life.

368
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,820
I hold a high position,

369
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,150
but there are many things
I can't help with.

370
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,190
I hope you

371
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,670
never have to experience this.

372
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,100
Father,

373
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,300
you're not alone.

374
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,100
I'll always stay by your side.

375
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,780
Father, what is this?

376
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,740
It looks so unique.

377
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,710
This is the golden soft armor.

378
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,150
Blades and spears can't pierce it.

379
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,230
So powerful!

380
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,670
Do you like it?

381
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,670
In that case, I'll give it to you.

382
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,300
Wear it when you go to the battlefield.

383
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,990
It can protect you, just like I do.

384
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,190
Father, Mother.

385
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,230
I'm sorry.

386
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,910
If you had worn
this golden soft armor...

387
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,870
I almost forgot what he looked like.

388
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,150
Only when I look at it

389
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,630
can I remember a little.

390
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,250
This must be the version of you
carved by General Xuan Shu.

391
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,780
But before he could finish,

392
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,870
they died because of me.

393
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,830
The love of parents for their kids

394
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,390
is never measured by gains or losses.

395
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,580
So don't blame yourself

396
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,670
for your parents' death.

397
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,490
My mother passed away
when I was very young

398
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,770
due to difficult labor.

399
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,710
My father once said

400
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,540
my mother had gone to the heavens

401
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
and become the brightest star.

402
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,710
It's that one.

403
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,060
Whenever I think of my mother,

404
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,340
I talk to that star.

405
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,060
I believe she can hear me.

406
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,260
You can try it too.

407
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,050
How can you believe that?

408
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,060
I didn't believe it at first.

409
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,740
But on a rainy night,

410
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,820
when I was at my most helpless moment,

411
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,540
I looked up and saw
that the sky was empty,

412
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,780
but that star was still there.

413
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,340
From that moment on, I believed it.

414
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,390
I believe that somewhere,

415
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,970
my mother's always been
watching over me.

416
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,020
So, your father and mother

417
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,780
must be able to hear you too.

418
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,100
Now that I'm in my father's position,

419
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,540
I understand why he liked coming here.

420
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,970
He bore heavy responsibilities
for Beixuan,

421
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,100
so he must've felt lonely and cold.

422
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,060
He had to bear everything for Beixuan

423
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,670
and Xuan Clan.

424
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,630
Everyone has responsibilities
they can't shirk.

425
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,910
The people of Beixuan
will always remember Mr. Xuan Shu.

426
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,340
Drink with me.

427
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,870
Jun Yujue is a jerk.

428
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,020
He's bullying me
while Feifan and Father are away.

429
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,300
I'm going to make him regret it.

430
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,860
Jiangjuan?

431
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,260
I knew you'd come
to Feifan's room again.

432
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,310
Jiangjuan,

433
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,870
what are you doing?

434
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,340
Why sneak around?

435
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,670
Xiukun.

436
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,740
What are you doing
with Feifan's clothes?

437
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,900
Jun Yujue has been

438
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,840
acting recklessly
since Father and Feifan left.

439
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,430
I'm planning to dress as Feifan

440
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,300
and scare him.

441
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,710
Don't mess around.

442
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,260
Though you look quite similar to Feifan,

443
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,740
Yujue will still recognize you.

444
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,780
Xiukun, I know what I'm doing.

445
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,430
I heard from Uncle Ling

446
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,150
that a caravan from Xixiang is coming.

447
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,150
They requested to meet with Feifan.

448
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,260
Now that Feifan's gone missing.

449
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,950
Jun Yujue plans to go greet them.

450
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,190
This can't happen.

451
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,390
Why don't I dress as Feifan

452
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,820
to discuss cooperation with them?

453
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,300
Then Jun Yujue can't go.

454
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,390
Do you think this will work?

455
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,190
Don't worry, Xiukun.

456
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,300
I know what I'm doing.

457
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,470
But you must keep this secret for me.

458
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,630
Don't tell anyone.

459
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,030
Okay.

460
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,630
Thank you, Xiukun.

461
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,300
Everyone gets tired.

462
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,430
When you're tired, you can come here

463
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,780
(Peak Pavilion)
to talk to your parents.

464
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,430
Resting like this is quite nice.

465
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,990
Look.

466
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,060
This is the red bean bracelet
from my mother.

467
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,710
I always wear it.

468
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,340
I've never taken it off.

469
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,630
It makes me feel like my mother
is always by my side.

470
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,190
Whenever I'm tired,

471

My current wish

00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,630
is to become the Wolf Lord asap

474
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,590
to uncover the truth from that year

475
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,190
and to avenge my parents.

476

you and Miss Qi Luo

that it was just a normal night?

Young Master,

524
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,230
Miss Qi Luo denied it afterward.

525
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,300
She clearly doesn't fully trust you.

Wo Shan doesn't like being disturbed

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,390
He will report back

This is the first time I've seen

540
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,140
the general spend the night
with a woman.

541
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,180
My Lady, you were worried,
so you went to stay with him,

542
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,430
and the general
is always attentive to you.

543
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,430
It won't be long

544
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,470

as Madam.

545
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,640
I'm not on the same path as the general.

546
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,420
We each have our own way to follow.

I just remembered
I have something to do.

555
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,310
I won't be returning with you.

556
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,700
Please take this cloak back.

557
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,150
What's wrong?

558
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,480
On our way
to the embroidery workshop yesterday,

559
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,270
Dongyin and I
saw some Yannan flower seeds.

560
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,930
I want to buy some
and try planting them.

561
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,660
But Yannan's flowers
prefer warm and flowing water.

562
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,310
The mansion only has well water.

563
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,500
I want to look for a water source

564
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,580
while the snow stops today.

565
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,760
I have nothing else to do today.

566
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,990
I can go with you.

567
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,150
I know the location of the water source,

568
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,620
so I can save you a lot of time.

569
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,500
Thank you, General.

570
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,190
Come on.

571
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,750
With your current position in the Xuan,

572
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,220
riding with me

573
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,470
might attract gossip.

574
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,390
I'll borrow another horse.

575
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,720
Borrowing a horse will delay it.

576
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,850
Please forgive me, Miss Jun.

577
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,980
(Yongning Gate)

578
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,790
Please.

579
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,220
My sincere apologies.

580
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,870
We had arranged to meet at noon,

581
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,430
but news came from Qian City

582
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,870
that I had to go there after this,

583
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,870
so you had to come into the city early.

584
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,500
Mr. Jun, you're too kind.

585
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,090
I've admired you for a long time.

586
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,990
It's an honor to collaborate with you.

587
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,060
After you.

588
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,340
Thank you.

589
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,220
Has the second branch gotten suspicious?

590
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,500
Yujue is still sleeping.

591
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,790
Good.

592
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,870
The goods are accounted for.

593
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,100
Now I can rest easy and report back.

594
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,310
This time there's a reason

595
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,620
I couldn't properly host you guys.

596
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,570
It's really a disgrace.

597
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,390
This honey cake comes from Yannan.

598
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,500
It's small but filling,

599
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,660
perfect for caravans
traveling long distances.

600
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,430
You can take it with you on the road.

601
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,270
I've heard that Young Master Jun Feifan

602
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,350
never misses a detail.

603
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Today, I see that it's indeed true.

604
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,500
It's only a small gesture. Thank you.

605
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,980
(Song Residence)

606
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,820
Yu,

607
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
what happened?

608
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,350
Jun Feifan has returned?

609
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,020
Yes.

610
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,500
He even delivered goods

611
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,910
to the Xixiang caravan.

612
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,430
All my effort these days are wasted.

613
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,910
Was the news
from the Uncontrollable fake?

614
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,270
I spent so much money

615
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,790
hiring bandits to kill Jun Feifan.

616
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,500
They had no reason to deceive me.

617
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,100
But if he really came back,

618
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,270
why hasn't there been any news
from the first branch?

619
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,620
I sent someone to probe the situation.

620
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,100
It's said that Jun Feifan

621
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,950
went to Qian City in a hurry

622
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,140
right after entering the house

623
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,450
to help Uncle with the accounts.

624
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,990
Now, all the major managers

625
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,430
probably know about this.

626
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,620
But I just managed

627
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,800
to break up their unity
at Brocade Embroidery.

628
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,790
The Chancellor is very pleased

629
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,990
with our taking the seal.

630
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,180
Now, he's back.

631
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,700
Isn't he ruining my plans?

632
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,060
Yujue,

633
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,500
calm down.

634
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,750
Come on.

635
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,830
Think thoroughly.

636
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,790
The managers only heard the news, right?

637
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,660
Yeah.

638
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,700
So,

639
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,430
except for the first branch,

640
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,140
no one has seen Jun Feifan,

641
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,830
right?

642
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,870
As expected of my father.

643
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,470
You're truly cunning...

644
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,750
Experience speaks for everything.

645
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,990
Well, he's going to Qian City, right?

646
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,310
Fine.

647
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,500
I'll arrange some people

648
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,310
for him on the way.

649
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,180
I don't care if he's Jun Feifan or not.

650
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,700
He'll never come back alive.

651
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
(Xiao Yan, Queen Mother of Beixuan)

652
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,140
Your Majesty, Consort Li is here.

653
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,180
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings.

654
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,020
Have a seat.

655
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,870
I heard that the other day,

656
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,990
Yu and Yi were playing here

657
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,660
and argued a little.

658
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,140
Yi is still young. Did he get hurt?

659
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,230
Your Majesty,

660
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,540
Yi is fine.

661
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,790
That's good.

662
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,350
Yesterday, the Queen came

663
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,790
and kept blaming Yu.

664
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,790
I've already scolded Yu.

665
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,830
These two kids grew up under my watch.

666
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,990
I'm heartbroken
whether either of them is hurt.

667
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,430
They wanted to learn horseback riding

668
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,340
with the Hunting Event
around the corner.

669
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,100
That's why it happened.

670
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,270
It was just a small matter.

671
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,500
The Queen and you
need not worry about it.

672
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,660
The Princes love

673
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,700
archery and riding at such a young age.

674
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,660
After the Hunting Event,

675
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,830
it's time to find a proper instructor
to teach them.

676
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,830
I heard that many riders

677
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,910
have gathered in the Royal City.

678
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,220
Why not seize this chance
to pick the right one?

679
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,830
Learning archery and riding together

680
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,180
could also strengthen their bond.

681
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,100
I'll keep this in mind.

682
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,990
These are sweets from Xixiang.

683
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,310
Try them.

684
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,340
Sure.

685
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,850
If the Queen Mother really cares
about our Prince,

686
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,700
why hasn't she ever visited Moon Palace?

687
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,020
As for the Queen,

688
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,270
she can't bear to say anything bad
about her son.

689
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,130
The Queen Mother and Queen
belong to the same clan.

690
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,870
What she said today

691
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,990
was just a warning for me,

692
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,950
telling me not to take revenge.

693
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,870
It's our Prince who has suffered,

694
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,170
but the Queen Mother only cares
about the Xiaos.

695
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,270
This is unfair.

696
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,660
Why did you propose

697
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,470
that they learn horsemanship together?

698
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,950
Aren't you afraid
our Prince will get hurt?

699
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,620
I once thought

700
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,310
that as long as Yi stayed away
from the Queen and her son,

701
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,100
he wouldn't be bullied anymore.

702
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,390
But now I see that silently enduring

703
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,520
only allows the Queen
to become more insufferable.

704
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,790
The horsemanship lesson
is just an excuse.

705
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,390
I still need to plan carefully

706
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,500
about how to use this chance.

707
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,700
So, you've started planning.

708
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,580
If it weren't for the Queen's
overbearing behavior,

709
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,990
who'd want to live a life
full of scheming?

710
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,830
Tonight, go deliver a letter
to the Luo Annexe for me.

711
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,460
Yes.

712
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,300
This compass has always pointed south,

713
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,750
but I've been walking
toward the tower for four hours.

714
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,350
Why haven't I found it?

715
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,020
You've checked three water sources.

716
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,310
None of them is suitable?

717
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,790
The water temperature
is too low.

718
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,680
Seems the flowers
can't be planted after all.

719
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,600
What's the required temperature?

720
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,000
It should be about the same
as the water temperature here.

721
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,640
There's still one place left.

722
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,990
I'll take you there.
