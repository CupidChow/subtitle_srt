Qingming.

19
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,950
Stop.

20
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,580
Qingming.

21
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,620
They outnumber us.

22
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,670
Retreat for now.

23
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,670
Go.

24
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,020
Come on.

25
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,860
No need to chase.

26
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,740
The master ordered

27
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,900
to push them into the forest.

28
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,580
Go back and report.

29
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,140
Go.

30
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,460
Why are you here?

31
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,950
Where's Young Master?

32
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,790
Mr. Luo.

33
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,830
What's the urgency?

34
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,930
Young Master went to find the princess
in the woods.

35
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,530
Fearing His Majesty's concern,

36
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,420
he sent me back to report.

37
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,670
The King's been busy
with the Hunting Event

38
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,140
and is having a rest.

39
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,860
Do not disturb the King.

40
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,420
Besides, Lie is there.

41
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,110
The princess should be safe.

42
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,420
Go back and await my word.

43
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,230
I'm on it.

44
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,390
Mr. Luo,

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,700
we should accompany you.

46
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,020
The Hunting Event begins in three days.

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,790
Lie is now the prime candidate

48
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,670
for the Wolf Lord.

49
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,670
All clans are watching the Xuan Clan,

50
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,830
especially the Xi.

51
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,230
If we deploy the Xuanyu Army now,

52
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,300
it'll alert all clans.

53
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,070
I'll go find them

54
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,390
and ensure their safety.

55
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,300
You should go back and act accordingly.

56
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,180
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

57
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,660
Mr. Jun.

58
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,260
A letter from the Jun Residence.

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,740
(Jun Feifan, Jun's eldest daughter,
Jun Qiluo is in our hands.)

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,100
(Come to the Uncontrollable alone.)

61
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,590
Qiluo?

62
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,470
Quick, send someone to the Uncontrollable.

63
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,580
Yes.

64
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,390
Stop.

65
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,990
Who are you?

66
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,650
We're merchants down the hill.

67
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,990
We were attacked by bandits on the road

68
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,260
and had no choice but to come here.

69
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,820
Could we stay for a night?

70
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,670
There are four of you; I can't decide.

71
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,870
I need to go ask.

72
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,220
- Go.
- Yes.

73
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,160
Their weapons belong to the military.

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,470
Why are they here?

75
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,910
They must be bandits.

76
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,380
You told the bandits we're merchants.

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,730
Are you trying to get us killed?

78
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,030
We are dressed in fancy fabrics.

79
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,380
If we'd said we were farmers,

80
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,630
they'd have been suspicious;

81
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,860
if officials,

82
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,730
they'd never have taken us.

83
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,030
How can you prove
you're ordinary merchants?

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,790
We left in a hurry today

85
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,040
and didn't bring anything
to prove our identity.

86
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,420
This hairpin was made
by our jewelry shop.

87
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,000
Send someone to check tomorrow.

88
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,000
They'll find out easily.

89
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,240
You're the head of the household?

90
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,430
Indeed.

91
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,590
I'm ashamed to say it,

92
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,970
but even though I'm a man,

93
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,300
my business skills aren't
even half as good as my wife's.

94
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,420
She's the one
in charge at home.

95
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,750
That's right.

96
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,820
My brother and sister-in-law.

97
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,940
If that's the case,

98
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,030
staying one night shouldn't be a problem.

99
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,220
Please.

100
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,020
Thank you.

101
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,790
I'll have someone

102
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,500
tidy these rooms up for you shortly.

103
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,220
Also,

104
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,420
I need to go over

105
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,360
some details with you.

106
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,420
The weapons are for hunting and self-defense.

107
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,910
You merchants are

108
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,080
not familiar with weapons.

109
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,150
So, don't touch them.

110
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,780
We won't.

111
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,150
How did you get so many scars?

112
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,410
I've been on the battlefield for years.

113
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,380
These were just minor injuries.

114
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,790
Is this the place you've been looking for?

115
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,670
They all have a totem on them.

116
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,350
The leader even had the totem tattoo.

117
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,030
There should be clues I seek here.

118
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,740
They are highly alert.

119
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,620
Finding clues won't be easy.

120
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,820
The Hunting Event is in three days.

121
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,100
Before that,

122
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,350
I must find a way to get them to talk.

123
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,670
About those in the forest today,

124
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,900
do you have any clues?

125
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,860
It must be Xi Changkun who led me away

126
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
from Royal City at this point.

127
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,300
He just didn't expect

128
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,300
I'd been looking for a chance to come.

129
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,790
It was a lucky shot.

130
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,070
But I don't think it's Xi Changkun.

131
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,360
Someone left a note for Qimin.

132
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,140
I came to find him.

133
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,310
But Xi doesn't know Qimin's identity.

134
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,260
What reason did the note give?

135
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,900
It claimed I was in danger.

136
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,710
Qimin came over without much thought.

137
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,210
He was worried about you.

138
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,900
We've grown up together.

139
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,020
It's natural for him to care about me.

140
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,470
You lost a hairpin while settling here.

141
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,310
I crafted this one myself.

142
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,900
It's worth much more than yours.

143
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,860
You're not shy about self-praise.

144
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,710
I never thought a warrior's hands like yours

145
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,380
could make such delicate hairpins.

146
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,580
Get some sleep.

147
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,350
You're injured,

148
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,070
so the bed should be yours.

149
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,590
There are bandits outside.

150
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,660
I can keep watch here.

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,020
We're pretending to be a couple,

152
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,620
so we need to act like that.

153
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,500
That was just to fool them.

154
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,430
No need to take it seriously.

155
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,380
All right, I'll sleep then.

156
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,830
What has Jun Qiluo offered you

157
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,430
to make you so devoted to her?

158
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,710
You belong to me

159
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,660
and should not think of others.

160
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,470
I am Princess of Beixuan,

161
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,130
while she's just a Yannan merchant.

162
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,830
She cannot compare to me.

163
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,310
In this deserted place,

164
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,260
no one knows who you are.

165
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,660
If you keep talking nonsense...

166
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,110
Are you going to kill me?

167
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,270
Go ahead.

168
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,470
Why not do it now?

169
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,990
You think your life matters?

170
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,900
Your death

171
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,110
would be a relief for others.

172
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
Her death

173
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,500
would be a relief for me.

174
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,190
Where are you going?

175
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,860
You always upset me over Jun Qiluo.

176
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,300
I'll go and deal with her.

177
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,140
(Xuanwu Palace)

178
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,980
Your Majesty,

179
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,470
I searched the forest all night.

180
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,220
Your Majesty.

181
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,230
- Your Majesty.
- Mother.

182
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,070
Your Majesty.

183
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,900
Any news of Qingkou?

184
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,500
Please don't worry

185
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,710
and take care.

186
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,710
Zhizhou, how did it go?

187
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,110
I searched the forest all night.

188
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,660
Though I haven't found
Princess Qingkou and Lie,

189
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,020
I've deployed more people now

190
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,590
and we'll find them soon.

191
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,430
Keep a close watch.

192
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,310
Report immediately if there's news.

193
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,530
Understood.

194
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,190
Mother,

195
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
don't be so concerned.

196
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,980
Sir,

197
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,830
scouts have sent word

198
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,310
that General Lie's entered the forest.

199
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,430
Keep a close eye on him.

200
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,780
If he tries to leave the forest,

201
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,590
ensure he stays until

202
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,350
the Hunting Event begins.

203
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,670
Understood.

204
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,740
Those with the baskets, men and women,

205
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,350
look like herb gatherers.

206
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,260
The man sharpening weapons

207
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,070
is probably going hunting.

208
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,860
Where will you start looking?

209
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,150
Chief.

210
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,950
We're going out for supplies.

211
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,630
We can escort you down as well.

212
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,780
My husband's wound has worsened.

213
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,070
Could we stay a few more days?

214
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,830
But we're low on medicine,

215
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,070
and it won't last long.

216
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,910
Medicine?

217
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,860
My husband knows herbs well.

218
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,150
He'll gather herbs

219
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,110
to stock your pharmacy.

220
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,430
But his wound...

221
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,430
It's all right.

222
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,590
I won't go far.

223
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,190
If my wound flares up,

224
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,030
I'll return at once.

225
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,970
You're living in the forest.

226
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,230
Surrounded by herbs,
yet unaware of them.

227
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,070
You trade game for herbal medicine.

228
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,660
I know a bit about herbs.

229
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,540
I'll teach you to identify them.

230
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,990
In the future, you can
gather herbs yourself,

231
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,110
saving you much effort.

232
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,540
Indeed.

233
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,620
We used quite a bit of your herbs yesterday.

234
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,900
Consider this our repayment.

235
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,430
All right then.

236
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
I'll send someone to take care of you.

237
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,230
If your wound tears,

238
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,540
he'll take you back.

239
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,910
Thank you, Chief.

240
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,900
You're injured, so be cautious.

241
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,430
I'll prepare the medicine

242
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,190
and wait for you.

243
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,430
Why did you do that?

244
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,430
Where is Lie?

245
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,570
He's injured.

246
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,060
If he's hurt, can you answer for it?

247
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,590
He has his own matters to attend to.

248
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,210
I suggest you not make such a fuss.

249
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
If you alarm the bandits,

250
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,740
you may never see him again.

251
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,350
Jun Qiluo, I don't like you.

252
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,380
Leave Beixuan at once.

253
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,350
It goes both ways.

254
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,470
I don't like you, either.

255
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,110
But in this world,

256
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,570
you can't do whatever you want.

257
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,830
I am a princess.

258
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,350
Both Lie and Qingming are mine.

259
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,750
I make the rules in Beixuan.

260
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,500
I told you not to rush with the bun.

261
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,710
Would you like some water?

262
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,540
I said to eat slowly.

263
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,350
Well, are you choking?

264
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,500
Have some water.

265
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,190
How dare you?

266
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,030
Look,

267
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,350
we'll be staying here for days.

268
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,780
It's fine if you don't like me,

269
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,710
but if the bandits get suspicious,

270
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
I can't protect you.

271
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,070
Xuan Lie and Shao Qimin
could die because of you.

272
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,540
Aren't you an expert in medicine?

273
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,020
You said they're both yours,

274
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,110
so the responsibility is yours.

275
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,710
You can decoct herbs, right?

276
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,260
Xuan Lie didn't enter the palace

277
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,710
but went to the forest?

278
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,550
Yes.

279
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,730
Since he got into the forest,

280
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,990
he's never come out.

281
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,190
His deputy general
and Luo Zhizhou searched for him

282
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,060
all night

283
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,430
and found nothing.

284
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,990
The terrain there is complex.

285
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,600
Easy to enter, hard to exit.

286
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,540
It seems Xuan Lie was in a panic,

287
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,470
heading towards his doom.

288
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,220
Father,

289
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,660
what do we do?

290
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,740
It seems we're not the only ones
trying to stop Xuan Lie

291
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,430
from attending it.

292
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,860
Since someone set the stage for us,

293
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,260
we'll take this chance to destroy him

294
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,540
and the Yannan merchant woman.

295
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,430
Send more people to watch them.

296
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
If things go wrong,

297
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,620
wipe them out.

298
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,860
Understood.

299
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,340
Xuan Lie,

300
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,710
it'll be a one-way trip for you.

301
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,310
I got the medicine from the Chief.

302
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,380
It should heal wounds effectively.

303
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,830
Ma'am,

304
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,860
the business conference is approaching.

305
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,070
When shall we return?

306
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,950
I need to get the crystal first.

307
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,740
But that won't be easy.

308
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,360
If we can't set off within half a month,

309
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,190
we might miss the business conference.

310
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,830
The Juns only have you now.

311
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,900
I understand your concerns.

312
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,340
But the black iron crystal is just

313
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,340
as important to Yannan.

314
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,190
I will plan carefully

315
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,950
to get the crystal quickly.

316
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,790
I'm back.

317
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,780
How's your wound?

318
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,740
It flared up a bit.

319
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,140
Where's my medicine?

320
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,630
Qingkou is preparing it.

321
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,230
Lie.

322
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,270
You're back.

323
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,990
Qingkou.

324
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,910
The medicine is ready.

325
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Hurry and drink it.

326
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,740
These bandits really know nothing.

327
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,470
Bronze wares have long been obsolete.

328
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,990
Yet they keep them like treasures.

329
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,990
They said

330
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,950
the bronze weapons are rare.

331
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,670
How could that be?

332
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,880
In Beixuan,

333
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,270
iron is the least of our worries.

334
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Except for the Xi Clan

335
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,950
where lacks stones and minerals.

336
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,500
Otherwise, the King wouldn't
have entrusted the black...

337
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,990
The black what?

338
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,710
Everyone,

339
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,060
the Chief invites you for lunch.

340
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,550
Please.

341
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,100
Sorry for the disturbance.

342
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,430
You're not upset but warmly welcome us.

343
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,620
We appreciate that.

344
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,990
You shouldn't have.

345
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,100
You've saved me a lot on medicine costs.

346
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,740
I'm the one who's grateful.

347
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,460
In a few days,
we'll head to the Uncontrollable.

348
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,300
Let's consider this meal a farewell.

349
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,950
Why are you going there?

350
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,940
The Xuan Clan wants to unify military power.

351
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,660
I have no choice but to leave.

352
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,060
What does it have to do with you?

353
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,060
To be honest,

354
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,190
over a decade ago,

355
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,260
we served in the army.

356
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,820
Then why not stay in the barracks?

357
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,690
If not for breaking a taboo

358
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,020
and risking death,

359
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,300
no one would come to this place.

360
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,340
That's true.

361
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,670
It has tricky terrain and isn't livable.

362
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,710
But what did you do

363
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,540
to end up here?

364
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,540
Not really.

365
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,910
I've never harmed anyone.

366
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,430
It was over a decade ago.

367
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,190
Back then, we were tasked

368
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,670
with a very important mission.

369
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,230
But someone betrayed us,

370
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,430
attempting to wipe us out.

371
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,580
Returning home,

372
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,710
I found bodies scattered all over.

373
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,470
I gathered my men

374
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,500
and fought them

375
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,910
for three days and nights.

376
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,950
Then, we fled here with the survivors.

377
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,470
This place is between the Xuan and Xi clans.

378
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
It's unclaimed,

379
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,390
so you settled here.

380
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,430
But only the Xuan and Xi clans
know this place.

381
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,630
Outsiders are unaware of it.

382
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,470
Were you former soldiers of the Xuan

383
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,820
or Xi clans?

384
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,260
As a merchant,

385
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,230
why are you familiar

386
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,230
with their conflicts?

387
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,710
To get by as merchants,

388
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,470
we must foster many connections.

389
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,670
We've spent a lot of money on this.

390
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,710
Yet we only know the basics.

391
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,710
The more you know,
the more trouble it invites.

392
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,500
But since you mentioned it,

393
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,100
we just talked a bit more.

394
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,640
We're all trying to make a living.

395
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,430
It's never easy.

396
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,340
Come on.

397
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,020
Have you thought of revenge?

398
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,140
Yes.

399
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,990
But ending war through war

400
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,950
has always been
the victory of the strong.

401
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,430
I've camped here for over a decade

402
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,300
and sheltered the homeless.

403
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,780
Not everyone knows how to fight.

404
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,870
With few soldiers, how to avenge?

405
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,260
In the past, we fought to survive,

406
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,060
obeying orders
with no choice but to battle.

407
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,670
But now we've just settled down,

408
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,340
why should we risk it again?

409
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,820
The King of Beixuan will choose
a Wolf Lord to unify power.

410
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,340
Then, he'll bring order to this place.

411
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,780
My men haven't fought in years.

412
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,990
When facing soldiers, we'll still die.

413
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,670
In the vast Beixuan,

414
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,020
there's no place for us to live.

415
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,340
How ridiculous.

416
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,180
Chief,

417
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,150
you're drunk.

418
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,660
Come on.

419
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,230
Why am I telling you this?

420
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,100
Let's drink.

421
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,070
All right.

422
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,580
Take me back to Royal City.

423
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,820
Why should I?

424
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Get lost.

425
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,860
Enough?

426
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,510
Hey.

427
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,330
How dare you look down on me?

428
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,670
Are you drunk?

429
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,340
She never left home.

430
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,990
It's normal to feel uneasy.

431
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,830
I apologize.

432
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,340
That's enough.

433
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,790
Why do you care?

434
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,960
Just leave.

435
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,040
You used me to find Jun Qiluo,

436
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,160
but she's not yours to take.

437
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,870
What do you know?

438
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,230
Jun Qiluo wants
the black iron crystal, right?

439
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,340
What else do you know?

440
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,100
Want to know more?

441
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,830
Beg me.

442
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,580
Jun Qiluo will never get the crystal.

443
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
What do you mean?

444
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,180
The black iron crystal

445
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,950
was decreed by the King for the Xi Clan.

446
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,910
But Xi Changkun hated Lie so much.

447
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,390
How could he hand it over

448
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,390
so easily?

449
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,060
When did that happen?

450
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,710
So Lie really didn't tell Jun Qiluo.

451
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,470
It seems Lie

452
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,990
isn't done with that slave yet.

453
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,060
He wants to use crystal to keep her.

454
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,870
So there's no way you can take her away.

455
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,990
Unless you kill Lie.

456
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,100
But with your skills,

457
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,340
you can't kill him at all.

458
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,470
So, you have to watch Jun Qiluo

459
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,470
remain Lie's servant forever.

460
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,470
And you must stay in Beixuan

461
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,020
with me.

462
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,180
Qingming,

463
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,300
you cause me pain

464
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,150
and sadness,

465
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,820
you won't get away with this.

466
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,430
Chief hasn't mentioned the past.

467
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,340
What do you do?

468
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,630
Before the Xuanyu Army arrives,

469
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,580
we need to find a reason

470
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,580
to keep them here longer.

471
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,710
My dear,

472
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,190
did you hurt your wound
while gathering herbs?

473
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,740
Please be extra careful,

474
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,390
or I will worry about you.

475
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,630
Everyone here is from the fort.

476
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,020
We must be careful with our words.

477
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,950
Why are you looking at me like that?

478
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,710
You said you worry about me.

479
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,950
Did you mean it?

480
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,950
You mean he always knew

481
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,740
Xi Changkun had the crystal?

482
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,070
Ma'am,

483
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,150
at this point,

484
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,710
you still don't know who he is.

485
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,290
He's been deceiving you all along.

486
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,190
It's all to keep you in Beixuan

487
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,300
and use you to find Jun Feifan.

488
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,340
Where it lacks stones and minerals.

489
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,950
Otherwise, the King wouldn't
have entrusted the black...

490
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,340
You can't waste time on him.

491
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,950
The Wolf Lord selection is near.

492
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,740
Now is the best time to leave.

493
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,710
Once you exit this forest,

494
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,020
head straight south.

495
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,990
I'll find a way to get the samples
from the mine.

496
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,500
We'll meet at the Uncontrollable.

497
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,740
If I don't show up

498
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,820
at the agreed time,

499
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,830
you must leave first.

500
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,260
You must get home
before the business conference.

501
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,660
Ma'am.

502
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,340
To attend it,

503
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,740
I'll need the Jun Trade Token.

504
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,950
But it is with him now.

505
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,990
I must retrieve it.

506
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,320
Why are you back so late?
I was about to look for you.

507
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,550
What do you mean?

508
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,300
You're truly cunning.

509
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,950
You made a deal with me

510
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,430
to help you get the position.

511
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,710
Yet, you gave the crystal

512
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,950
to Xi Changkun,

513
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,260
balancing the powers in Beixuan.

514
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,340
It's a well-played game indeed.

515
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,060
Before I sought permission,

516
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,710
the King had granted it to the Xi Clan.

517
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,630
If we want it back, we need to find a way.

518
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,260
I didn't tell you

519
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,110
because I was planning to retrieve it.

520
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,500
I didn't intend to deceive you.

521
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,580
So, have you thought of a way?

522
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,740
And how confident are you?

523
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,870
Since our deal's off,

524
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,060
please return my token.

525
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,630
Our paths shall never cross from now on.

526
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,470
Our paths shall never cross?

527
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,870
Though we've come so far,

528
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,820
the trust between us

529
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,670
is weaker than that deal.

530
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,430
I'm just a merchant.

531
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,390
I only honor deals.

532
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,430
Besides, you broke it first.

533
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,780
Talking about loyalty

534
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,260
is utterly ridiculous.

535
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,430
So, in your heart,

536
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,230
profits and black iron crystal

537
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,260
mean more than anything else.

538
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,380
Indeed.

539
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,990
Please return my trade token.

540
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,030
Enough of that.

541
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,540
Hand over the token.

542
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,100
Do you break our deal

543
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,910
because of him?

544
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,830
Or,

545
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,630
entering the forest was your front?

546
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,580
You planned to leave with him all along?

547
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,470
Unable to get the black iron crystal,

548
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,500
I have no reason to stay.

549
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,700
(Jun)

550
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,390
You came to Royal City with me

551
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,820
not just for the black iron crystal.

552
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,870
Why such a strong reaction suddenly?

553
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,420
Qiluo,

554
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,500
what are you hiding?

555
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,950
Give the token to her.

556
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,340
Xuan Lie!

557
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,710
What are you doing?

558
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,550
Consider it

559
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,670
a payback for the Uncontrollable.

560
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,740
If you try

561
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,020
to take Qiluo away,

562
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,060
I won't let you off.

563
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,100
You're just a thug.

564
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,470
Who do you think you are?

565
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,230
Ma'am,

566
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,740
we can't trust him anymore.

567
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,820
Qimin, stop it.

568
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,870
I won't do anything to hurt you.

569
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,100
Trust me.

570
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,750
You're awake.

571
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,730
After taking the medicine,

572
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,710
how do you feel?

573
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,240
You're worried about me?

574
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,740
You weren't worried about yourself.

575
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,020
Why should I be?

576
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,630
I was thinking

577
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,150
if you really died here,

578
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,740
I couldn't get the crystal

579
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,990
nor the token.

580
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,780
I might have to collect your body

581
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
as your wife

582
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,390
and pay the funeral fee to the fort.

583
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,390
That's not a good deal.

584
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,630
Don't worry. It's not serious.

585
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,340
Now, tell me,

586
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,580
do you need the crystal

587
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,950
to help Jun Feifan's business?

588
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,740
You still don't trust me?

589
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,870
Of course I trust you.

590
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,270
Do you?

591
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,340
Do you trust me?

592
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,260
Do you have a plan?

593
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,340
Yes.

594
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,950
But on one condition.

595
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,070
General,

596
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,340
you're pushing your luck now.

597
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,470
We had a deal already.

598
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,020
Are you raising the stakes?

599
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,950
You know very well

600
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,710
even if the crystal ends up
with Xi Changkun,

601
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm the only one who can help you.

602
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,940
Or perhaps,

603
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,580
you didn't let Shao Qimin
kill me last night

604
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,100
because you were worried.

605
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,070
General,

606
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,580
what are your terms?

607
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,950
My request is simple.

608
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,670
Just help me find the evidence

609
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,910
of Xi Changkun's arms dealing back then.

610
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,850
This way,

611
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,710
you'll get what you want,

612
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,020
and I'll uncover the truth I seek.

613
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,030
Deal.

614
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,820
We're leaving for the Uncontrollable soon

615
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,410
and are short on money.

616
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,500
You should leave.

617
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,150
Just leave.

618
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,540
- Hurry and go.
- Quickly.

619
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
Don't stay here.

620
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
It's just money.

621
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,060
When Lie recovers,

622
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,990
I will repay you double.

623
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,150
If we leave now,

624
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,870
and something happens to Lie,

625
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,020
I will bring down this fort for sure.

626
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,860
Young lady,

627
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,910
you're quite bold for your age.

628
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,230
We've been more

629
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,910
than generous in taking you in.

630
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,390
Do you want to wipe us out?

631
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,580
- Exactly.
- No way.

632
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,820
We kindly took you in.

633
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,100
Make way, please.

634
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,230
Gentlemen,

635
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,060
we have caused you trouble lately.

636
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,950
I know you're going to the Uncontrollable

637
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,920
and you need money.

638
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,020
But my husband is injured.

639
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,540
Could you please do us a favor

640
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,820
and allow us to stay longer?

641
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,390
We will definitely pay you.

642
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,910
If it's possible,

643
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,080
we'll use this necklace as collateral.

644
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,820
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

645
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,020
Why are you out here?

646
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,100
You are my wife.

647
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,870
How can I let you face it alone?

648
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,990
You've camped here for more than a decade.

649
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,910
Going to the Uncontrollable
will only be worse.

650
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,340
If you trust me,

651
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,710
just cooperate with me.

652
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,260
I'll reopen the old case

653
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,060
and ensure peace for you.

654
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,190
You see yourselves as bandits

655
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,780
for defensive reasons.

656
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,580
There are elders and children,

657
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,630
and you all bear the same totem.

658
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,150
You are well-trained.

659
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,100
More like soldiers and their families.

660
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,100
As for your weapons,

661
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,060
they're not for looting.

662
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,190
They're meant for survival,

663
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,620
right?

664
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,300
How can we trust you?

665
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,390
- Yes.
- Why should we?

666
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,230
Exactly.

667
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,670
(Xuan)
I'm Xuan Lie, Leader of the Xuan Clan.

668
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,870
The old case

669
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,950
concerned the Xuan Clan.

670
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,350
I'm helping you, also myself.

671
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,180
General Xuan Lie.

672
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,750
- Chief.
- Chief.

673
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,100
Back then, the Xi Clan forced me here.

674
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,870
Now, the Wolf Lord will be selected.

675
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,180
How can I be sure
you'll help once you get it?

676
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,340
Chief,

677
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,540
Xi Changkun and I are fierce rivals.

678
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,990
The enemy of my enemy is my ally.

679
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,180
I'm sure you understand this.

680
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,350
What benefits

681
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,660
can you offer us if we help?

682
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,140
Chief, may we speak privately?

683
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,540
My father died
investigating arms smuggling.

684
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,830
Chief, can you help me solve the case?

685
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,990
We've been hiding here for years,

686
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,830
dreading that Xi Changkun will find us,

687
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,310
leaving us with no place to hide.

688
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,790
If I assist you

689
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,990
and things go wrong,

690
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,270
how will I explain to them?

691
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,220
Do you plan to hide forever?

692
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,500
Back then, Beixuan was unstable,

693
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,350
with Xi Changkun holding power.

694
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,730
That's why the case was unresolved.

695
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,750
Now, we're choosing a Wolf Lord.

696
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,060
The King promised

697
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,660
if I become the Wolf Lord
and stabilize the Five Clans,

698
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,390
he would definitely help me.

699
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,750
General, what do you want from us?

700
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,430
We were just
receiving the goods back then.

701
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,180
We didn't know what
was being transported to Cangzhou.

702
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,390
Ten years ago,

703
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,020
Beixuan and Xixiang had just begun trade.

704
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,660
Everywhere they passed,

705
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,470
it required a travel pass

706
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,560
from the local government.

707
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,270
If you transported weapons for him,

708
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,500
surely you have the travel pass.

709
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,500
If it could've proved him guilty,

710
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,350
why would we have hidden until now?

711
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,540
I can make it serve its greatest purpose.

712
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,060
One piece of paper for your lifelong safety.

713
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,990
This deal is worth it for you.

714
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,270
Take this token

715
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,240
and lead them to
the place I've arranged.

716
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,020
My Xuan Clan will ensure your safety.

717
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,100
