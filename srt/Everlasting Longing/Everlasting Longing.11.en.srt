17
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,340
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)

18
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,430
Greetings, Chancellor.

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,640
Wish you a long life.

20
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,990
Chancellor,

21
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,950
just a little something to say thanks.
Please take it.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,680
Mr. Yujue, you are too kind.

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Chancellor,

24
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,000
our Jun family owes its success

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,840
entirely to your support.

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,870
However, my cousin's whereabouts
are still unknown.

27
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,470
- I think...
- No need to think or say more.

28
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,080
I have two questions for you.

29
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,150
First,

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,400
can you achieve
the same results as Jun Feifan?

31
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,750
Chancellor,

32
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,910
you may not know,

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,870
but I've managed

34
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,910
to make my jewelry store flourish!

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,030
Your jewelry store?

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,870
Yes.

37
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,190
How much counterfeit jewelry
did you sell last year?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,840
People can see through it all.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,710
Yes, Chancellor.

40
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,150
I admit, I was confused at the time.

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Chancellor,

42
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,000
what's your second question?

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,630
How will you guarantee

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,750
Jun Feifan won't return alive?

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Chancellor,

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,630
your second question

47
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,240
is a minor issue.

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,030
You know the Uncontrollable.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
That area is a mess, full of

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,630
bandits and corpses everywhere.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
Besides,

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,310
if my cousin were alive,

53
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,750
with his intelligence,

54
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,080
he would've returned by now.

55
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,680
Do you think I will

56
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,680
support you based on your empty words?

57
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,030
Where's the evidence?

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I need facts.

59
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,150
Sure, sure.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
I understand.

61
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,030
I understand.

62
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,310
Is it settled?

63
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,030
Yes.

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,470
We should leave now,

65
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,910
or we'll miss the Hunting Event.

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,630
The mastermind used you to lure me

67
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,960
into the forest for this.

68
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,310
I won't let him have his way.

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
What's wrong?

70
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,190
Once you become Wolf Lord

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,720
and unify the Five Clans,

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,630
will you attack Yannan?

73
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,230
Even if it's the King's command,

74
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,870
I won't let the people suffer.

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
Feifan once said

76
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,870
that he had a grand vision.

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,630
He wanted to open trade between

78
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,430
Beixuan, Yannan, and Xixiang.

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,560
The Uncontrollable is
the perfect trading hub.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,720
If a trading post is set up there,

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,870
it could reduce conflicts.

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,360
Now that I'm in Beixuan

83
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,430
and have met you,

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,040
if there's a chance,

85
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,600
I want to fulfill his dream.

86
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,790
A trading post?

87
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Yes,

88
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,630
to facilitate trade
between the three clans

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
and foster communication
among the people.

90
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,200
It's more helpful than harmful.

91
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,190
If you truly don't wish
to attack Yannan,

92
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,040
this is a perfect opportunity.

93
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,160
Consider it, General.

94
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,100
I'll think it over carefully.

95
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Xuan Lie,

96
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,160
can I trust you?

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,870
I'll do my best

98
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,720
to keep my promise to you.

99
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't break your promise to me.

100
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,080
Also,

101
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,390
the gift I gave you

102
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,120
holds my feelings.

103
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,240
Don't just give it to others.

104
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,120
Mr. Sun, what brings you here?

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,590
Mr. Luo, I...

106
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,480
May I speak with you in private?

107
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,160
Sure. This way, please.

108
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,720
I heard General Lie has gone missing.

109
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,870
The Hunting Event is about to start.

110
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,120
What should we do now?

111
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,000
I've sent troops to search for him,

112
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,390
but there's still no news.

113
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,750
At such a critical moment,

114
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,950
his disappearance
can't be a coincidence.

115
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,190
Something's definitely off here.

116
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,120
Could Xi Changkun

117
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
be behind this?

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,040
Whoever is behind it,

119
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,600
Lie must return tomorrow

120
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,880
to hand over the Military Token.

121
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,780
Otherwise, the Wolf Lord will not...

122
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080
Mr. Sun.

123
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,360
What do you mean by this?

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Mr. Sun,

125
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,680
Lie's top priority now

126
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,870
is becoming the Wolf Lord

127
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,000
and helping the King unify the armies.

128
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,560
But he's still not back,

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,870
and we might end up
in a leaderless battle.

130
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,600
If Xi Changkun seizes this chance,

131
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,480
all our previous efforts

132
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,430
will be in vain.

133
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,720
Then the Xuan Clan, the Luo Clan,

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,830
and even the Sun Clan will be in danger.

135
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,760
Since you have decided to help Lie,

136
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
why not go all the way?

137
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,160
If Lie doesn't return tomorrow,

138
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,030
I will fully support you in competing

139
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,600
for the Wolf Lord title.

140
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,400
Me?

141
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,360
Mr. Luo, please rise.

142
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,830
Don't put me in a tough spot.

143
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,310
I have no interest in
being the Wolf Lord.

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,310
Liangzhou is remote,

145
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,950
bordering Xixiang
and the Uncontrollable,

146
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,430
surrounded by enemies.

147
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,360
If I become the Wolf Lord,

148
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
I'll have to live in...

149
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,720
Central Town, the Royal City.

150
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,190
What about the people of Liangzhou?

151
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,120
But you're Lie's ally.

152
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,310
In his absence,

153
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,070
we must come up with a flawless plan.

154
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,710
Mr. Luo,

155
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,600
General Lie trusts you the most.

156
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,390
If one of us should do this,

157
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,310
I believe you're the best candidate.

158
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,160
I'll fully support you in competing
for the Wolf Lord title.

159
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,630
- But, Mr. Sun...
- General Luo.

160
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,190
Don't turn it down.

161
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,310
Given the situation,

162
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,070
this is the only thing we can do.

163
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,240
Hurry up,

164
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,790
or we'll miss the Hunting Event.

165
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,030
I'd hate to miss out

166
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,360
on such a big event.

167
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,730
You're not fully healed yet.

168
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,960
We'd better slow down.

169
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
I'm fine.

170
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Xuan Lie!

171
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,390
My Lady, you all go hide.

172
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,390
I'll lead them away.

173
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,550
- Qimin...
- Qingming.

174
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Let's go.

175
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,650
Sir,

176
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,600
our men

177
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
have withdrawn from the northern forest

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,790
and are guarding the exits.

179
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Before the Hunting Event,

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,720
they are trapped in the forest.

181
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,320
We won't let them escape.

182
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,110
Dismissed.

183
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,550
Come on in. Sit down.

184
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,320
Those attackers aim to kill you.

185
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,630
They clearly don't want you
to leave the forest alive.

186
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,320
Their outfits differ
from the previous group.

187
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,120
They must be from another faction.

188
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,080
It seems

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,660
Xi Changkun isn't the only one
who doesn't

190
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,630
want me to be the Wolf Lord.

191
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,240
You're burning up.

192
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,030
It's the fever from your wound.

193
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,910
Let's rest here for now.

194
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,160
Qiluo,

195
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,510
they are after me.

196
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,470
You should go.

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,360
I can handle this.

198
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,270
Don't say that.

199
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
You promised me.

200
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,240
If you become the Wolf Lord,

201
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,660
you'll convince the King
to establish a trading post

202
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,000
and not attack Yannan.

203
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,910
I'll keep my promise.

211
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,510
Is anyone in that cabin?

212
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,350
Go take a look.

213
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,350
Someone escaped.

214
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,510
Go get them!

215
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,550
- Go get them!
- Yes!

216
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,630
Hurry!

217
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,110
Qingming!

218
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,440
What are you doing?

219
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,630
Just stay here. Don't get in my way.

220
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,380
You always say you don't care about me,

221
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,440
but you always protect me.

222
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,660
(Xuanwu Palace)

223
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,350
Your Majesty,

224
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,200
General Xuan Lie and Princess Qingkou

225
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,550
are still not found.

226
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,390
Useless fools!

227
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,600
What's the point of reporting nothing?

228
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,870
Go find them!

229
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,630
Qiluo?

230
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,350
Qiluo?

231
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,440
Qiluo!

232
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,870
Answer me! Where is Xuan Lie?

233
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
Don't worry.

234
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,550
If we capture this woman,

235
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,870
Xuan Lie will come for her.

236
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,390
Don't waste your breath.

237
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,360
Xuan Lie won't come for me.

238
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,790
Even if you capture me,

239
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,790
it won't help you at all.

240
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,440
Well, we'll see!

241
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,670
Do you really think

242
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,720
Xuan Lie, Xuan Leader,

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
would walk into a trap and quit

244
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
the Wolf Lord Election for me?

245
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,440
Stop the nonsense.

246
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,150
Speak! Where is Xuan Lie?

247
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,550
Oh no, Xuan Lie is
seeking reinforcements.

248
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,550
We'll deal with you before Xuan Lie.

249
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,470
Put her down!

250
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,150
What are you doing here?

251
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,840
Go back to the Wolf Lord Election.

252
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,120
You're risking your life!

253
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,270
Aren't you risking your life

254
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,200
to lure the enemy?

255
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,870
Reinforcements! Retreat!

256
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,670
I can't walk.

257
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,150
I can't walk.

258
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
I said I can't walk.

259
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
What do you want now?

260
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,150
Aren't you eager
to join the Hunting Event?

261
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,550
But suddenly,

262
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,910
I find being with you

263
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,240
more interesting than the event.

264
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,230
Just go ahead

265
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,720
and leave me here alone.

266
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,870
If wolves eat me,

267
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,280
then

268
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,390
the King and Lie will blame you.

269
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,920
You will finally get your wish

270
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,550
and join me in death with Jun Qiluo.

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,880
But at least this way,

272
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,720
we can be together forever.

273
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,680
What can I do to make you walk?

274
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,200
I'm hungry.

275
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,510
Get me a rabbit,

276
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,110
and I'll go once I'm full.

277
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,480
Are you leaving?

278
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,590
Where are you going?

279
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,790
Go hunt a rabbit.

280
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,160
Why do you follow Jun Qiluo?

281
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,130
What's special about her?

282
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,950
None of your concern.

283
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,920
What I said today is true.

284
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,960
Only I can get you
into the Hunting Event

285
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,550
and help you

286
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,830
send Jun Qiluo back to Yannan.

287
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,480
Have you thought it through?

288
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,600
Will you follow me or not?

289
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,480
My patience is limited, you know.

290
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,480
Why do you want to help me?

291
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,110
Because I like you.

292
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,110
Since childhood,

293
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,590
no one has ever shown

294
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,880
their true thoughts to me

295
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,510
or dared defy me.

296
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,680
You're the only one.

297
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,750
So, I'll give you a hand.

298
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,160
I'll go with you.

299
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,030
From now on,
whenever I blow this whistle,

300
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,000
you must appear.

301
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,110
If not, our agreement will be void.

302
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,110
It's done.

303
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,550
Don't forget that.

304
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,200
Luo Qi will escort Qingkou.

305
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,110
They'll ride back with Shao Qimin.

306
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
We'll take the boat

307
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,480
and should make it to the Hunting Event.

308
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,830
How's your wound?

309
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,590
The roadside herbs worked well.

310
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,200
It's almost dawn.

311
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,550
If you lose the chance

312
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,270
to become the Wolf Lord to save me,

313
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,670
will it be worth it?

314
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,520
Yes, it will.

315
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,430
Moreover,

316
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,640
you risked your life for me.

317
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,030
If you're ever in danger again,

318
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,530
light the signal flare immediately.

319
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,240
No matter where you are,

320
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,310
I will come to you right away.

321
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,880
We've only known each other for months,

322
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
but you've been planning

323
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,930
to become the Wolf Lord for years.

324
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
Perhaps

325
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,000
it's where my heart leads,

326
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,780
and I find it hard to control myself.

327
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,000
If I fail to become the Wolf Lord,

328
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
I will plead with the King

329
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,270
using my military merits.

330
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,920
But when I think

331
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,180
you might get into trouble
because of this,

332
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,480
I can't calm myself down.

333
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,720
I searched for you desperately,

334
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,350
hoping to

335
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,920
keep you by my side forever.

336
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,520
What about you?

337
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,920
Will you stay for me?

338
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,820
(Xuan, Xi, Luo, Sun, Su)

339
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,910
Your Majesty,

340
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,400
we can't wait any longer.

341
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,030
The Xuan Leader hasn't arrived.

342
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,880
It means he has given up.

343
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,190
Your Majesty,

344
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,480
the Hunting Event should start.

345
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,730
The incense hasn't burned out.

346
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,310
Waiting a bit longer won't hurt.

347
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,510
Missing the auspicious time
might offend the heavens.

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Announce it.

349
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,630
Here I come!

350
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,590
Queen Mother, my King,

351
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,830
I apologize for my lateness.

352
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,680
You're not late, just on time.

353
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,830
How did you get all these injuries?

354
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,160
Didn't Qingkou return with you?

355
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,160
Queen Mother, don't worry. I'm fine.

356
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,640
Princess Qingkou
has returned to her tent.

357
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,430
She will join us after freshening up.

358
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,870
Great.

359
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,240
General, you are truly
a noble of high birth.

360
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,750
For such an important event,

361
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,830
yet you're the last to arrive.

362
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,440
Without me as a rival, Mr. Xi,

363
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,350
wouldn't it be dull?

364
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,590
Let's begin.

365
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,480
May Beixuan be blessed!

366
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,310
May Beixuan be blessed!

367
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,640
Good wine, isn't it?

368
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,480
Exactly.

369
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,240
How about another drink?

370
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,590
Sure. Mr. Luo?

371
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,160
- Cheers.
- Mr. Luo.

372
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,090
Zhizhou's always been
a favorite with the ladies.

373
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,400
It's time he settles down
and starts a family.

374
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,400
Join us for a drink.

375
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,270
Princess Zhaomin is also
of marrying age.

376
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,960
She is a perfect match for Mr. Luo.

377
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,790
Of all the noble ladies,

378
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,720
Princess Zhaomin seems
the best match for Lie.

379
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,110
Sorry, I misunderstood.

380
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,400
Your Majesty, you want Princess Zhaomin
to marry the Wolf Lord.

381
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,160
Who is this, so blind?

382
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,000
General Lie.

383
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,620
(Xi Jixiu, Princess of the Xi Clan)
I'm Xi Jixiu, Princess of the Xi Clan.

384
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,680
My father is Xi Changkun,
the clan Leader.

385
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,310
The Queen Mother is my aunt.

386
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
General Lie, I'm here

387
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,590
to witness your greatness.

388
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Xiu,

389
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,040
come here.

390
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,110
What are you doing?

391
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,310
I should be asking you that.

392
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,240
Do you know who he is?

393
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,000
He's Xuan Lie, Brother.

394
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Of course, I know that.

395
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,160
But your infatuation...

396
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,440
Have you fallen for him?

397
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,960
You're the Princess of the Xi Clan.

398
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,720
Chasing him like that is undignified.

399
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,880
Don't forget,

400
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,830
the Xi Clan and the Xuan Clan
are like fire and water.

401
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,730
The Xiao family of the Xi Clan
has been the royal family's in-laws.

402
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,070
And as the Princess
of the Xi Clan, I, Xi Jixiu,

403
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,350
should marry the most
outstanding man in Beixuan.

404
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,270
And that is Xuan Lie.

405
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,240
You...

406
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,680
How's your injury?

407
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,400
Will it affect the election?

408
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,880
The Physician checked it. I'm fine.

409
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,870
Don't worry.

410
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,590
It took you so long

411
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,960
yet you are still in dirty clothes.

412
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,910
Are you jealous?

413
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,440
It's a good thing for you to be

414
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,640
favored by the noble ladies.

415
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,920
If they keep praising you,

416
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,440
your chances

417
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,350
of becoming the Wolf Lord
will shoot through the roof.

418
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,680
Miss Jun is absolutely right.

419
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,720
I don't need women to help me win.

420
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,590
I'll let you talk.

421
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,070
I'm going to see Zhaomin.

422
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,480
Are you happy now?

423
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,390
She's angry with me.

424
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,720
I didn't expect the fearless Lie to have

425
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,750
something he's afraid of.

426
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,680
What exactly did you ask Miss Jun for?

427
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,630
Young Master,

428
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,780
the Xi's former soldiers
are going to the settlement.

429
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The Xi's former soldiers?

430
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,440
I'll tell you later.

431
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Have we identified

432
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
the attackers in black?

433
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Not yet.

434
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,510
Since you and Miss Jun disappeared,

435
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,310
I've had people watching all the clans.

436
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,590
In recent days,

437
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,080
only the Xi Clan sent people
to the city's north late at night.

438
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,240
Their hands can't be clean.

439
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,480
- Leader.
- Leader.

440
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,110
Come on. Cheers.

441
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,640
Since Yao City,

442
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,270
he's wanted you dead.

443
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,830
The reason

444
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,350
may go beyond just the title

445
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,190
of the Wolf Lord.

446
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,750
No matter how many disguises

447
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,350
he puts on, I'll expose him.

448
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,160
After you left,

449
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,440
I led the embroiderers

450
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,350
to find quality silkworms
and improve our craft.

451
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,720
Also, I arranged work for many victims.

452
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
Now, Liangzhou is thriving.

453
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,870
That's good to hear.

454
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,520
By the way,

455
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,240
did you find that fragrant stone
you mentioned before?

456
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,160
I found it,

457
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,730
but it'll take a little while to get it.

458
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,550
- Is that so?
- This beauty must be

459
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,400
the Yannan woman General Lie captured

460
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,900
from the Uncontrollable.

461
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,820
(Su Yande, Head of the Su Clan)
What a beauty.

462
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,960
But you're too skinny

463
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,200
to bear children.

464
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,270
So, name your price.

465
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,200
How about 100 sheep?

466
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Su Yande,

467
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,550
watch your mouth!

468
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,590
Just because General Lie's not here,

469
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,350
doesn't mean you can lay a hand on Qi.

470
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,750
Mr. Su, if you were
sold on the black market,

471
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,440
you probably wouldn't
fetch half a sheep.

472
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,310
But if priced by weight,

473
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,510
maybe two.

474
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,920
Now that's a feisty one. Not bad.

475
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,590
No wonder General Lie likes you.

476
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,070
I'll offer 50 more cows...

477
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,880
If you dare touch her,

478
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,830
you'll be my enemy.

479
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,550
Oh... Mr. Su,

480
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,160
you... you never change.

481
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,680
Still can't see the situation.

482
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,440
Desiring someone who's not yours,

483
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,590
Mr. Su, you're quite the daring one.

484
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,280
Exactly.

485
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,160
Take a look at yourself.

486
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,000
How dare you covet Qi Luo?

487
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,160
Zhaomin, mind your manners.

488
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,110
I can't believe Liangzhou
is allowing women to compete!

489
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,070
I qualified through the clan selection.

490
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,270
If you weren't a Leader,

491
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,270
you wouldn't be worth

492
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,790
sitting here with your skills.

493
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,030
- You...
- Mr. Su,

494
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,720
aren't you leaving?

495
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,870
Fine.

496
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,680
See you on the field!

497
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,240
General,

498
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
the King requests your presence.

499
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,520
Greetings, Xu.

500
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,790
Why are you so late?

501
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,350
What happened?

502
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,590
I was attacked,

503
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,440
but luckily, Miss Qiluo saved me.

504
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,790
I managed to get away.

505
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,440
That Yannan woman again?

506
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,160
Do you know

507
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,030
who tried to kill you?

508
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,030
I've sent people to investigate.

509
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,880
At such a critical time,

510
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,680
it's truly unfair to you.

511
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,590
I also heard that the mining accident

512
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
was no mere accident.

513
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,590
Do you already have a answer?

514
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,750
Xi Changkun worked hard

515
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,960
to eliminate my chance

516
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,030
of becoming the Wolf Lord.

517
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,400
But that's the situation now.

518
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,760
The only way forward

519
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,400
is to win the election

520
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
and become the Wolf Lord.

521
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,880
Then we can settle all scores,
old and new.

522
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,280
Otherwise,

523
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,310
with the Queen Mother
backing the Xi Clan,

524
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,030
even I cannot stand up for you.

525
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,310
Rest assured, Xu.

526
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,920
I won't let you down.

527
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,540
(Jun Mansion)

528
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,350
Mr. Yujue...

529
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,510
What's the hurry?

530
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,070
Take your time.

531
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,120
Mr. Yujue,

532
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,800
a trading caravan has arrived outside.

533
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,190
They're asking to meet and do business
with the Jun Manager.

534
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,550
The Jun Manager?

535
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,590
(Auspicious Yang)
I just became the Jun Manager.

536
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,480
He doesn't deserve to meet me
whenever he wants.

537
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Handle it as usual.

538
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,710
But they're a caravan from
the Sun Clan in Liangzhou, Beixuan.

539
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,920
What is that?

540
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,110
A letter they handed over.

541
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,800
"Seeking the stone. Don't worry."

542
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,910
Commander,

543
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,080
we've been waiting for you
in the Royal City for days.

544
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,510
The King instructs you to bring
the person back immediately.

545
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,960
Give me a little more time.

546
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,670
Stay in the Royal City for now.

547
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,630
Don't expose yourselves.

548
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,550
I will report directly to the King.

549
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,520
Yes.

550
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,320
- Don't rush. Don't rush.
- Father!

551
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,630
- Take your time.
- Bad news!

552
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,710
Bad news!

553
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,360
Don't rush!

554
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,390
Take your time.

555
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,280
We are doomed out there,

556
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,760
and you're still playing with birds?

557
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,240
Take a look yourself!

558
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,940
(Seeking the stone. Don't worry.)

559
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
"Seeking the stone. Don't worry."

560
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,360
I specifically followed
the Beixuan caravan

561
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,200
to ask around.

562
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,110
They mentioned
a merchant woman, Jun Qiluo,

563
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,360
helped with the deal

564
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,960
and even passed along a letter home.

565
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,070
Qiluo?

566
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,800
Jun Qiluo!

567
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Isn't Jun Qiluo a hostage in Beixuan?

568
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,180
How could she be doing business
with the Sun Clan?

569
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,600
Could it be...

570
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,360
Could it be Uncle secretly opened

571
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
trade routes behind our backs?

572
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,640
No way.

573
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,440
Even if they did establish trade
with Beixuan,

574
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,480
knowing your uncle's temperament,

575
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
he would have informed me.

576
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,320
Son,

577
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
something's fishy about this.

578
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,000
Fishy?

579
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,910
Father,

580
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,800
why don't we capture
Jun Qiluo's wet nurse

581
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,640
and interrogate her?

582
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,670
We'll know the truth.

583
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,920
My son is so clever!

584
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,190
You bet!

585
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,950
Young Master,

586
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,550
a lady named Qiluo is here to see you.

587
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,110
What brings her here?

588
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,760
Let her in.

589
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,760
Yes.

590
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,360
Young Master Xi, long time no see.

591
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,550
What are you doing here?

592
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,710
Did Xuan Lie ask you to?

593
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,230
I have something
to discuss with you, Mr. Xi.

594
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,320
With me?

595
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,430
What is it?

596
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,400
I'd like to do business with the Xi Clan

597
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,440
and purchase some black iron crystal.

598
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,670
Did I hear you right?

599
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,480
You want to do business with me?

600
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,040
You're Xuan Lie's strategist

601
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,110
and my adversary.

602
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,840
Why should I do business with you?

603
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm a merchant.

604
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,630
There are no permanent friends

605
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,960
or enemies in business.

606
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,110
Who you sell the mine to

607
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,480
doesn't matter,

608
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,800
but sell it to me and I will

609
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,510
offer a better price.

610
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,910
Young Master Xi,

611
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,320
this is a deal
where you only stand to gain.

612
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
Think it over.

613
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,630
You're quite interesting.

614
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,630
Then tell me,

615
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,550
what do you need these crystals for?

616
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,230
The Jun family deals
in textiles and jewelry.

617
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,030
Black iron crystal can improve looms

618
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,590
and be polished into
the fine jewelry pieces.

619
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,840
Only by putting the mine in my hands

620
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,840
can it reach its full potential.

621
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,360
Quite a bold claim.

622
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,630
Since the King

623
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,070
granted these crystals to the Xi Clan,

624
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
I'm also in talks with
other cities and towns

625
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
and will sign contracts in a few days.

626
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,840
I'm afraid I can't sell it to you.

627
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,880
I can offer double the price,

628
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,960
no matter who you're selling it to.

629
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,150
You didn't go to my father with this

630
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,320
but came directly to me.

631
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,030
Do you think I'm easy to manipulate?

632
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,630
Young Master Xi,
don't underestimate yourself.

633
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,920
You are the future Leader of Xi Clan.

634
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,360
If I want a long-term
partnership, naturally,

635
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,400
you're the best person to speak with.

636
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,110
Young Master Xi,

637
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,710
don't you want to impress your father?

638
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,440
Everything is prepared.

639
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,030
Just place it there later.

640
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,800
Forgive me, Deputy Luo.

641
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,640
Be careful next time.

642
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,640
Put the bow back.

643
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,400
- Let's go.
- Luo Qi.

644
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,680
Miss Jun?

645
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,960
Is this the bow for General's election?

646
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,280
Yeah, I'm about to give it to him.

647
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,670
I heard General's Wushao Bow

648
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,320
is a rare masterpiece.

649
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
May I have a look?

650
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,550
That's not appropriate.

651
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,400
This is the Young Master's regular bow.

652
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,440
The election will start soon.

653
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,480
I'll return it shortly.

654
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,640
Miss Jun...

655
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,800
How should I report to the Young Master?

656
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Young Master,

657
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,060
though you confessed
your feelings to Miss Jun,

658
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,630
once you claim the Wolf Lord's title,

659
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,670
the King will definitely
arrange your marriage for peace.

660
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,110
Have you explained this to Miss Jun?

661
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,920
She doesn't seem to care about me.

662
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,440
Why do I bother telling her that?

663
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,480
Miss Jun surely likes you.

664
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,360
Think about it. Which girl wouldn't care

665
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,880
about her beloved's affairs?

666
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,670
Miss Jun keeps her thoughts to herself.

667
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,360
Silence doesn't mean no ideas.

668
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,070
No agreement means still observing.

669
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,360
Why else would she take your Wushao Bow

670
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,590
before the election to vent her anger?

671
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,670
She took my Wushao Bow?

672
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,150
Yes, she said she'd return it shortly.

673
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,070
Perhaps she's holding it hostage,

674
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,400
waiting for you to go and apologize.

675
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,990
Never mind.

676
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
Bring me a spare bow.

677
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,110
But that's your regular bow,

678
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,150
- I'm afraid...
- Just go.

679
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,800
Yes.
