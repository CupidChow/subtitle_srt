17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,310
This time, I won't let them succeed.

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,760
The dress made by Miss Jun

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
is indeed beautiful.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,870
But she seems to have changed
since the wedding day.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
How so?

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,870
It seems her voice
has become very different.

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,710
You must have heard wrong.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,480
Could it be that the bride
isn't Miss Jun?

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,400
This is too absurd.

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,360
Maybe I did hear wrong.

27
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,470
Father,

28
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,000
send someone to investigate

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
whether there was anything unusual
at the Jun Mansion

30
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,630
on Jun Qiluo's wedding day.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,590
Are you thinking...?

32
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,240
Are you sure you saw
Beixuan's Wolf Lord?

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
Absolutely sure.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
After the scout's report,

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,360
I went to verify it myself.

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,150
How could he come
to Yannan at this time?

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,120
Why would he appear
in Jun Qiluo's store?

38
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,990
Chancellor,

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
did he come to Yannan

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,800
to investigate the old case
from years ago?

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
If that's the case,

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,430
it could be troublesome for us.

43
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,750
You should go check

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,150
the list of attendants
with the Beixuan envoy.

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,960
I want to see what he's really up to.

46
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,870
You saw Shao Qimin leave the mansion

47
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,470
on Jun Qiluo's wedding night?

48
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,710
Yes.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,910
That day was Miss Jun's wedding.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,750
I was at the Jun Mansion all day,

51
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,400
hoping for a meal.

52
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,910
At night, I slept outside the mansion.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,520
On his wedding night,
he didn't go to the bridal chamber

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,250
but hurried to leave the mansion.

55
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,400
I was also puzzled at the time.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Remember.

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,470
You don't know anything.

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,960
I know.

59
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,750
No, I don't know.

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,100
Thank you, Mr. Chengsong.

61
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,280
If you need to know anything,

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,310
just ask me.

63
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,710
Yes.

64
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,630
On the wedding night,

65
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,360
the groom rushed to leave the mansion.

66
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,770
Is the bride chaperone
telling the truth?

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,200
The bride wasn't Jun Qiluo?

68
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,430
I've sent people to ask their servants.

69
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,870
They don't know anything.

70
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,800
They just said that Shao Qimin ordered

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,240
no one was allowed into his room

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,000
without his permission.

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,460
But the bride chaperone also said

74
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,120
the bride's voice
didn't match Jun Qiluo's.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,910
Did she really find a substitute?

76
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,680
But this marriage was her decision.

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Why would she need to find a substitute?

78
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,560
Who cares why?

79
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,870
Our Yannan has strict customs.

80
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,360
Let's spread

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,830
this news,

82
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,510
and Jun Qiluo will never stand

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,510
in Yannan from now on.

84
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,300
(Jun Mansion)

85
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,270
(Wind Pavilion)
The Royal Procurement Office

86
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,680
will select fabrics and silks
for the Palace in a few days.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
How is our silk gauze going?

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,700
Don't worry, Qiluo.

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
They're all ready.

90
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,430
There's no better silk
in the Royal Capital

91
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,310
than ours.

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,410
The Office will definitely
cooperate with us.

93
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,210
With our order of 150,000 bolts of silk,

94
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,370
and the order from the Office,

95
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,700
our shop's reputation will soar,

96
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,480
and the family business
will soon be ours.

97
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,720
Miss Qiluo, Miss Jiangjuan, this is bad.

98
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,720
What's wrong, Uncle Ling?

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,830
Now everyone is saying

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,000
that Miss Qiluo
and Mr. Shao's marriage is fake.

101
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,910
And they also say...

102
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,590
Say what?

103
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,140
They say you didn't even have

104
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,870
the ceremony on the wedding day,

105
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,750
and someone else did it with Mr. Shao.

106
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,480
Now, the whole capital
is gossiping about this.

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,720
No wedding ceremony?

108
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,950
Who can make up such a ridiculous rumor?

109
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,310
Don't worry, Qiluo.

110
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
Once I catch...

111
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,670
Qiluo,

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,950
is the rumor true?

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
The rumors are getting heated.

114
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,660
I'm afraid the King already knows.

115
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,050
I'll go to the Palace first.

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,960
I'll go with you.

117
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,270
Qiluo, what is going on?

118
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,830
Ask Father not to worry.

119
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,020
I'll explain when I get back.

120
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,030
Let's go.

121
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,270
Qiluo.

122
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,000
Those 150,000 bolts of silk

123
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,000
could be your way out.

124
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,930
You can use the 150,000 bolts of silk

125
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,290
to negotiate with your King

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,750
and cancel the marriage.

127
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,920
Right now, Yannan's treasury is empty.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,870
He will agree.

129
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,830
This is my marriage with Mr. Qiluo.

130
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,940
If you hadn't kidnapped her
on the wedding day,

131
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,580
there wouldn't be any of these troubles.

132
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,720
At that time, I didn't know

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,390
she was marrying you

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,630
to protect the Jun family.

135
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,410
Yes, Miss Jun.

136
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,430
My young master has tried

137
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,600
every possible way these days.

138
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,640
Qiluo,

139
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,560
I want to protect
the Jun family with you.

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,720
The matters of our family
are not for you to decide.

141
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,270
Thank you for the 150,000 bolts of silk.

142
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,270
I'll write a borrowing contract for you.

143
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,190
As for my marriage with Qimin,

144
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,390
the moment I decided to marry him,

145
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,510
I had forgotten everything
from the past.

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
If you'd truly let go,

147
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,250
you wouldn't have risked
taking me in,

148
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
nor would you worry about my safety,

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,890
constantly urging me
to return to Beixuan.

150
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,110
Qiluo,

151
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,820
you don't need to deceive yourself.

152
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,510
You're the one deceiving yourself.

153
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,560
I just want you to disappear
from my sight now

154
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,070
and never disturb my life again.

155
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,110
Okay.

156
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
My Lady,

157
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,070
have you really let go?

158
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,800
It's getting late.

159
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,190
Let's go to the Palace.

160
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,460
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)

161
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,190
A fake marriage?

162
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,950
Now it's spreading all over the capital.

163
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,390
The one who married Shao Qimin

164
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,040
isn't even Jun Qiluo.

165
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,750
How could that be?

166
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,600
On the wedding day,
I went to the Jun Mansion,

167
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,310
and I didn't notice anything suspicious.

168
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,070
If the one who had the wedding ceremony
with Shao Qimin wasn't Jun Qiluo,

169
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,910
who could it be?

170
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,030
Where did Jun Qiluo go?

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,630
I've been investigating
Xuan Lie's whereabouts

172
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,840
and found that he wasn't with the envoy.

173
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,270
The envoy's list and numbers match.

174
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,630
In that case,

175
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,080
he sneaked in secretly.

176
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,630
Perhaps Jun Qiluo's fake marriage

177
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
is related to Xuan Lie.

178
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,750
They were very close back in Beixuan.

179
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,360
After I killed Xi Changkun,

180
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,720
though I pointed all the evidence
toward her,

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,670
Xuan Lie didn't believe it.

182
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,150
Now that he's in Yannan,

183
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,550
and they're back together,

184
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,550
they might reopen the old case
from 12 years ago.

185
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,770
If that's the case,

186
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,000
these two can't be left alive.

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,270
I'll find someone to kill them.

188
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,150
Wait.

189
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,030
There's no need to dirty our hands.

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,670
Since he sneaked in secretly,

191
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,270
no one knows his identity.

192
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
Find a way to tell the Forbidden Troops

193
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,360
that a spy from Beixuan
has infiltrated Yannan.

194
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,390
The Forbidden Troops
will take care of it.

195
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,670
How clever.

196
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,720
Ignoring my orders,

197
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,790
you pretended to marry.

198
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,240
You two really have big guts.

199
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,320
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

200
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,790
This happened for a reason.

201
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,030
When I was about to enter
the bridal sedan,

202
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,110
I heard that thieves had sneaked
into my workshop.

203
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,390
I didn't have time to arrange everything

204
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,970
and hurried out to investigate.

205
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,240
But if the bride was missing
on the wedding day,

206
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,440
then Qimin and I

207
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,520
would've become
the laughingstock of the capital.

208
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,440
Luckily, a distant cousin of mine

209
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,230
kindly took my place
in the bridal sedan.

210
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,200
By the time I rushed back,

211
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,720
they had finished the ceremony.

212
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,200
Afterward, I swapped back
with my cousin.

213
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,240
Is that true?

214
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,630
Your Majesty,

215
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,510
everything Miss Qiluo said is true.

216
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,200
Then the thief must have chosen

217
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,030
an extremely clever time to act.

218
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,120
If your King asks,

219
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,670
you can say that the shop
was broken into by thieves,

220
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,460
so you couldn't make it in time.

221
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,250
I've arranged everything else.

222
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,630
Your Majesty,

223
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,440
I dare not say anything false.

224
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,630
Whether there were thieves
in the workshop,

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
you can easily find out.

226
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
Your Majesty,

227
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,030
I have one more request.

228
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,630
Tell me.

229
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,360
Though the substitution had its reasons,

230
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,080
it is true that we didn't perform
the wedding ceremony.

231
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,840
The commoners are gossiping,

232
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,070
slandering Miss Qiluo
and the Juns' reputation.

233
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,720
This has also harmed your dignity.

234
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,870
I humbly request that you allow us

235
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,150
to cancel the marriage.

236
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,030
So, you two are not satisfied

237
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,910
with the marriage I granted you?

238
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,750
Of course not.

239
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,990
Your Majesty,

240
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,670
it is a great blessing for me

241
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,030
to marry Miss Qiluo.

242
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,940
Your grace is overwhelming,

243
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,670
and I am deeply grateful.

244
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,820
But now rumors are rampant
in the capital.

245
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,030
The commoners know

246
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,630
that my bride that day
wasn't Miss Qiluo.

247
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,840
As Baigong's heir,

248
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,010
if Miss Qiluo lives
in such rumors day and night,

249
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,010
she'll never be able
to focus on serving you.

250
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,960
In the end, you'll suffer losses.

251
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,510
Are you questioning me?

252
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,440
Your Majesty, please calm down.

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,080
Jun Qiluo, how dare you!

254
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,480
Not only did you disregard my orders
and find someone to replace you,

255
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,910
but now you want to cancel
the marriage I granted you.

256
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Do you think
you can overturn everything?

257
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,880
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

258
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,750
Your Majesty,

259
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,360
whether I marry or not,

260
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,140
I will remain loyal
to Yannan and to you.

261
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,630
I've heard that the peace negotiations
are nearing their end.

262
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,910
To establish the trading post,

263
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,510
we need to give Beixuan
some silver and fabric every year.

264
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,600
The Juns are blessed by you.

265
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,150
I'm willing to donate
150,000 bolts of silk every year

266
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,840
to relieve you of some burdens.

267
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,840
150,000 bolts of silk

268
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,080
is no small sum.

269
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,440
If it can ease your burdens,

270
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,000
the Juns will never refuse.

271
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
If I demand 150,000 bolts of silk

272
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,510
to be delivered within a month,

273
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,320
do you think you can do it?

274
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,160
Your Majesty, rest assured.

275
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,960
I'll deliver it within a month.

276
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,350
Good.

277
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,680
You may leave.

278
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,380
I have something to discuss with him.

279
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,870
I take my leave.

280
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,260
(Xuanwu Palace)

281
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,560
Your Majesty.

282
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
Your Majesty,

283
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,390
what exactly is going on?

284
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,030
How did Qingkou marry that slave?

285
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,440
Mother, please calm down.

286
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,200
I just learned about this news myself.

287
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
No one in Yannan knows
about the marriage

288
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,130
between Qingkou and Shao Qimin,

289
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,510
so Beixuan won't recognize it.

290
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,840
Qingkou and Lie...

291
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,270
One is the Wolf Lord of Beixuan;

292
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,750
the other is the Princess of Beixuan.

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,630
Yet both have been enchanted
by people from Yannan.

294
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,750
With the peace negotiations ongoing,

295
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,150
they're secretly hiding in Yannan.

296
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,550
If Zhao Guang finds out,

297
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,600
it might cause some trouble.

298
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,910
Send them a letter now to ask them

299
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,550
to return to Beixuan immediately.

300
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,510
Don't worry, Mother.

301
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,150
I'll send a letter
to He Jiyao right away,

302
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,250
telling him to bring
Qingkou back at once.

303
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,240
Especially Lie.

304
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,440
Tell him to come back at once,

305
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,240
or he won't be the Wolf Lord anymore.

306
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,390
He'll have to stay in Yannan forever

307
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,750
and live with that merchant girl.

308
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,560
Go now.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,910
Farewell, Mother.

310
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,310
Deliver a letter to the Wolf Lord.

311
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,200
Yes.

312
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,630
Your Majesty, news from Moon Palace

313
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,270
says Consort Li is ill.

314
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,360
Go and send the letter now.

315
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,560
Yes.

316
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,520
(Moon Palace)
I'm begging you.

317
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,270
Let me go and find
the imperial physician.

318
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,470
The consort is seriously ill.

319
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,330
She's been unable
to get out of bed for days.

320
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,270
The King has ordered

321
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,320
no one is allowed to enter
or leave Moon Palace.

322
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,270
I won't go out.

323
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Could you please make a trip

324
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,650
to find the imperial physician?

325
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,320
Miss Xin,

326
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,510
please don't make it hard for me.

327
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,910
Who doesn't know that Moon Palace
is neglected now?

328
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,870
Who'd dare to care about Consort Li?

329
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,040
Your Ladyship,

330
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,770
please drink some water.

331
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,870
Your illness is worsening.

332
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,790
Without the imperial physician

333
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,790
or medicine,

334
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,910
what should we do?

335
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,630
It's fine.

336
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,870
In this deep palace,

337
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,080
if I can find relief soon,

338
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,750
it would be a blessing.

339
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,200
I just hope

340
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,910
that my son can grow up
safely and healthily.

341
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,320
And him.

342
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,320
As long as they're both well,

343
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,910
I'll be at peace.

344
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,820
(Xixiang)

345
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,860
(Late Mother, Li Rouran, R.I.P.)

346
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,080
Mother,

347
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,750
I wasn't able to fulfill your wish.

348
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,640
You must be very disappointed.

349
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,940
(Late Mother, Li Rouran, R.I.P.)

350
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,880
Zhizhou, catch the ball.

351
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,110
Come on.

352
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,950
What's wrong?

353
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,270
My friends are all playing cuju
with their fathers.

354
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,160
When will Father come and see us?

355
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,200
Your father is busy
with official duties.

356
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,920
What's wrong with playing with me?

357
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,680
But when will he finish?

358
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,960
I haven't seen him in years.

359
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,270
Your father is far away in Beixuan.

360
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,110
It's too far from Xixiang.

361
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,590
If he had time,

362
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,640
he'd come to see you.

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,840
Mother,

364
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,680
why don't we go to Beixuan?

365
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,350
That way, we can see Father every day.

366
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,270
Be quiet.
Stop thinking about your father.

367
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,160
He doesn't want to see us.

368
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,110
He has a wife and daughter in Beixuan.

369
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,790
If you weren't his only son,

370
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,680
he wouldn't care about you at all.

371
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,800
Zhizhou,

372
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
remember.

373
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,640
If you meet a woman you like
when you grow up,

374
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,440
you must treat her with all your heart.

375
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,270
Don't betray her trust,

376
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
and never make her sad.

377
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,000
I will remember.

378
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,150
Mother.

379
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,200
Though I used the Luo Clan
to save her life,

380
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,070
I have failed her trust.

381
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,000
I only wish that Xuan Xu
would treat her well.

382
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,940
(Yuchen Palace)

383
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Enough.

384
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,550
How many years have you been with me?

385
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,240
Your Majesty,

386
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,110
it's been 20 years.

387
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,750
Since you've been working for me,

388
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,840
you've handled countless
difficult situations.

389
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,590
You've never disappointed me.

390
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,270
But it's just Jun Qiluo this time.

391
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,790
Why did you fail?

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,200
You even hid the truth
about the substitution with her.

393
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,030
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

394
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,240
It was my negligence.

395
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,790
I did investigate Jun Qiluo's movements

396
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,960
on the wedding day.

397
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,550
There were indeed no suspicious signs.

398
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,720
No suspicious signs?

399
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,750
Or are you hiding them for her?

400
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,680
I wouldn't dare.

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,550
You wouldn't dare?

402
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,110
I don't think so.

403
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,660
(Blessed Forever)

404
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,550
But it's fine.

405
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,680
You've been with the Juns for years.

406
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,590
If you've grown attached to them,

407
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,720
I can understand.

408
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,960
The Royal Surveillance exists for you.

409
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
As the commander,

410
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,780
I obey your orders without question.

411
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,110
Are you saying

412
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,200
that you'd be willing to do anything

413
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,320
I asked for?

414
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,630
Yes.

415
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,680
What if I ask for your life?

416
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,550
As a secret guard,

417
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,510
if you lose my trust,

418
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,680
you become as insignificant as dust.

419
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,510
I've prepared

420
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,310
the antidote
of this poisoned wine for you.

421
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,590
You must take it on time every month.

422
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,110
Once you take it, you'll be safe.

423
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

424
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,790
If this happens again,

425
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,440
I won't let you off so easily.

426
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,070
This is the antidote for this month.

427
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,960
Qiluo, you're back.

428
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,780
There's big trouble.

429
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,790
Father wants you to go
to Qimin's room to see him.

430
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,630
What?

431
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,110
Father.

432
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,880
Miss Jun, I'm terribly sorry.

433
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,750
The Princess heard some rumors
and was looking for Shao Qimin.

434
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,550
That's when she ran into Mr. Jun.

435
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,830
Qiluo, what's going on?

436
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,070
Qiluo, who are they?

437
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,270
Why are they in Qimin's room?

438
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,590
Let's go back.

439
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
(Blessing for Generations)

440
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,110
So, the rumors are true.

441
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,900
Qimin didn't marry Qiluo,

442
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,550
but he married the Princess of Beixuan,

443
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,830
who's in his room now.

444
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,960
Qiluo,

445
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,000
how could you be so foolish,

446
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,310
hiding the Princess of Beixuan here?

447
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,960
If the King finds out about this,

448
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,590
what will happen?

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,840
Father,

450
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,240
they're my friends.

451
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,510
They looked after me
when I was in Beixuan.

452
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,160
I can't let them fall into danger.

453
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,510
Is the father of your unborn child

454
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,590
also from Beixuan?

455
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,190
He's dead.

456
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,270
No one can find out about this.

457
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,550
Find a chance to get them to leave.

458
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,790
We can't have any more ties
with people from Beixuan.

459
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,550
(Open and Inclusive)
How bold!

460
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,830
How could she find a substitute?

461
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,750
Is this true?

462
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,790
These two even pretend

463
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,720
to be a couple now,
spending time together.

464
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,030
It really damages public morals.

465
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,640
Merchants only care about money

466
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,680
and don't understand any etiquette.

467
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,840
You're right.

468
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,480
Shuting,

469
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,200
why are you here drinking alone?

470
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,830
It's because of your cousin.

471
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,110
Look

472
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,790
at how the commoners
are talking about her.

473
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm engaged to Xiukun.

474
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,030
How will that affect my dignity?

475
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,480
You should calm down.

476
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,750
I've advised Qiluo many times.

477
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,550
I told her, as a woman,

478
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,570
she should be reading
Lessons for Women at home.

479
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,750
But she insisted on ignoring
the rules and propriety,

480
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,300
wandering around the streets every day

481
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,790
with my two younger cousins.

482
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
How inappropriate.

483
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,070
Xiukun has been corrupted by her.

484
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,920
Don't get angry now.

485
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,160
If you ask me,

486
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,830
I'd close down her shop.

487
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,960
That way, she'd calm down.

488
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,550
At that time, Xiukun

489
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,880
won't be following her

490
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,240
around the streets.

491
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,350
Right?

492
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,720
Do you have any good ideas?

493
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,200
Well, I do have a plan.

494
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,920
But I'll need your help.

495
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,000
Come on, let me tell you.

496
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,950
No, no.

497
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,410
This isn't what a gentleman would do.

498
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,920
Let me finish first.

499
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,260
My father is an old friend of Mr. Liu,
who manages the imperial exams.

500
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,270
Right? If you help me this time,

501
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,830
I can introduce you to him.

502
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,680
Once you pass the imperial exams,

503
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,160
you can repay me...

504
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,480
my family.

505
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,150
Right?

506
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,680
You're right.

507
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,830
We're thinking
about the reputation of the Juns.

508
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,790
No woman has ever been
in charge of the family.

509
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,080
You're right.

510
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,960
Jun Qiluo not only led Xiukun astray,

511
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
but she also shamelessly

512
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,920
slept with someone and got pregnant.

513
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,130
Did your King blame you
for the substitution?

514
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,350
As you expected, he didn't blame us.

515
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,590
Your engagement with Shao Qimin...

516
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
It was canceled,

517
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,160
but it won't change anything.

518
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,000
Qiluo,

519
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,200
since I arrived in Yannan,

520
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,040
we've never had a proper conversation.

521
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,480
You've never let go of me.

522
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,590
Why do you keep pushing me away?

523
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,550
So what if I haven't let go?

524
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,200
You are the Wolf Lord of Beixuan,

525
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,310
and I am Baigong's heir of Yannan.

526
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,500
We are destined to never be together.

527
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Is that all?

528
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,640
That's not enough?

529
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,110
These are insurmountable gaps.

530
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,840
I am a merchant.

531
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,000
After weighing the pros and cons,

532
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,200
you'll know the most correct option now

533
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,590
is for us to live peacefully
and separated.

534
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,950
Are these

535
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,750
your true feelings?

536
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,630
Yes.

537
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,830
You should hurry back to Beixuan

538
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,750
and marry the best girl for you.

539
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,040
I wish you

540
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,160
a virtuous wife, smart kids,

541
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,240
and a smooth

542
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,160
and safe life.

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,870
Fine.

551
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,840
♪Our love is like thorns in my hand
and sand in my eyes♪

552
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,370
♪I only wish you'd feel
the pain of my scar♪

553
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,310
♪As the veil lifts,
our love comes to an end♪

554
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,430
♪Scattered far away♪

555
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,560
♪With you not there♪

556
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,040
Qingming,

557
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,310
now the entire Jun family

558
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,750
knows of my existence.

559
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,800
In the future...

560
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,160
You're hurt?

561
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,870
Come here.

562
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,550
Who hurt you?

563
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,080
I'll make him pay with his life.

564
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,590
You're poisoned?

565
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,110
Give it back to me.

566
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,870
Give it back.

567
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,060
This has nothing to do with you.

568
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,880
Don't tell anyone.

569
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,610
This medicine can only
ease your pain for a while.

570
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,000
It can't cure the poison.

571
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,920
But don't worry.

572
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,640
I'll soon prepare the antidote for you.

573
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,310
Don't lie to me.

574
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,030
It must be very difficult to make.

575
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,150
In this world,

576
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,030
there's no antidote
that I can't prepare.

577
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,390
Wait for me.

578
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,330
I'll apply some wound medicine on you.

579
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,910
Where are you going?

580
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,020
Accompany Miss Qiluo to the Office.

581
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,410
You were injured yesterday.

582
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,920
You should rest at home today.

583
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,790
You can't go out.

584
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,350
I used your medicine yesterday,

585
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,560
and it's healed.

586
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,270
The antidote will be prepared soon.

587
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,630
I'll be back shortly.

588
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,720
After I left yesterday,

589
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,700
did the King make things hard for you?

590
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,000
He only scolded me a little.

591
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,910
It's okay.

592
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,200
Don't worry, My Lady.

593
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,160
Why did you suddenly request to cancel

594
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,880
our marriage yesterday?

595
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,070
I just didn't want you
to regret it later.

596
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,240
These past few days,
you've been conflicted in pain.

597
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,510
I couldn't ignore it.

598
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,790
Since there's another way
to protect the Jun family,

599
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,240
and this marriage is not
what you've hoped for,

600
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,980
it might be better to cancel it.

601
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,910
Qimin...

602
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,790
I've informed Master about this.

603
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Though he was a bit angry,

604
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,260
saying we acted without his permission,

605
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,680
he ultimately accepted it.

606
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,750
But he now knows
that Qingkou is in the mansion.

607
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,520
Don't worry.

608
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,830
I've arranged everything.

609
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,920
Qiluo, let's go.

610
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,670
Let's go.

611
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,700
(Embroidery Yard)

612
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,260
(Excellent Craftsmen)

613
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,480
Next.

614
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,240
My Lord.

615
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,240
Hurry.

616
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,750
Please take a look.

617
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,400
This is the silk
from my Brocade Embroidery.

618
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,400
It can be said

619
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,680
that it's unique in the world.

620
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,790
This is silk gauze,

621
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,270
the thinnest silk in the world.

622
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,110
Jun Qiluo plans to present this
to the Office.

623
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,680
I went to find Xiukun today

624
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,130
and secretly took it from her.

625
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,160
Thank you, Shuting.

626
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,030
Thank you.

627
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,550
This is silk gauze,

628
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,350
developed by my Brocade Embroidery

629
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,270
over many years.

630
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,160
It's the thinnest silk in the world.

631
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,790
Their silk is exactly the same as ours.

632
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,440
Young Master, we'll be exposed
in such clothes.

633
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,230
Why did you insist on coming?

634
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,170
The Office is purchasing fabric
for the Palace.

635
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,510
It's a major event
for all the workshops in the capital.

636
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,750
Jun Yujue will make trouble.

637
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,590
You're still worried about Miss Jun.

638
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
(Embroidery Yard)

639
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,200
Silk gauze is a new masterpiece
from my Brocade Embroidery.

640
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,400
It took us many years to make.

641
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,550
It's as thin as a cicada's wing
and light as smoke.

642
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,030
If folded, it can be placed in...

643
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,200
What masterpiece? Jun Yujue.

644
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,680
You must have stolen our silks.

645
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,110
Jun Jiangjuan.

646
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,110
Jun Yujue.

647
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,000
You can make reckless deals,

648
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,070
but how can you make
a baseless accusation?

649
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,200
You even poked me with your finger!

650
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,950
Jun Jiangjuan.

651
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,440
Let me tell you.

652
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,830
This silk gauze was created

653
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,030
with countless hours of effort
by the embroiderers

654
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,070
in my Brocade Embroidery.

655
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,550
Don't pinch me!

656
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,830
A gentleman won't resort to violence!

657
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,190
Shao Qimin,

658
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,070
do you want to hit me
in front of everyone?

659
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,910
How audacious!

660
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,720
Qimin, let go.

661
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,440
Look at you.

662
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,150
There's a reason

663
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,670
none of you succeeded.

664
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,760
How shameless!

665
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,440
How could you possibly make silk gauze?

666
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,630
Jiangjuan,

667
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,320
we are family.

668
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,150
How could you speak like that?

669
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,910
Forget it.

670
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,070
You're still so young.

671
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
I won't argue with you.

672
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,200
How about this?

673
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
You should also

674
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,190
show everyone your sample.

675
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,630
Yes, show us.

676
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,630
Yes, show us.

677
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,440
- Show us.
- Yes.

678
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,410
Let's see it.

679
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,390
You can't do that, huh?

680
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,230
Present it.

681
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
This is exactly like the silk gauze
of the Brocade Embroidery.

682
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,880
My Lord, this silk gauze

683
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,800
was made from special silkworms
by Xiukun.

684
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,670
Jun Yujue and his people
stole our sample.

685
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,400
I know how hard it is
to open a new shop,

686
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,110
and I understand you want to make a name

687
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,280
for your shop with this order,

688
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,440
but you should never

689
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,000
steal our silks

690
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,630
and then slander us.

691
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,470
You...

692
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,430
Uncle,

693
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,150
since you claim the silk gauze

694
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,760
was made by your Brocade Embroidery,

695
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,030
do you even know

696
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,840
how to make such light and thin silk?

697
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,320
Of course.

698
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,590
But it's a secret method,

699
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,070
so I'm unwilling to reveal it.

700
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,880
If I tell you,

701
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,230
my cousin will know.

702
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,230
When she knows,

703
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,070
she'll steal it from us.

704
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,630
Are you worried I'll steal it,

705
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,590
or is it that you don't know?

706
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,030
You...

707
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,550
I don't think this silk gauze

708
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,840
is a secret.

709
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,670
Today, I'll share it with everyone.

710
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,000
To make this extremely light silk gauze,

711
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,840
we need to select three-sleep silkworms,

712
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,930
and during the breeding process,

713
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,030
- we must control the size.
- Three-sleep silkworms.

714
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,400
Only this way can we ensure

715
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,030
the silk they produce is light and thin.

716
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,630
From silkworm eggs to cocoons,
spinning to weaving,

717
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,070
every step is crucial.

718
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,920
Yujue, do you know that?

719
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,760
Of course...

720
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,880
Qiluo, you're so stubborn.

721
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,840
We are bound by blood,

722
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,710
yet you're so heartless.

723
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,550
- Yes.
- Heartless?

724
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,580
Uncle,

725
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,030
what nonsense are you spouting now?

726
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,780
You silly girl.

727
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,000
It has nothing to do with you.

728
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,550
Qiluo got pregnant before marriage.

729
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,590
As your uncle, I've done my best
to keep it a secret for you.

730
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,190
Why are you so ungrateful

731
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,670
and always opposing us?

732
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,600
- Yes.
- Shut up.

733
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,710
Brat, leave.

734
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,670
Is this true?

735
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,030
Everyone, please look at this.

736
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,230
Qiluo,

737
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,230
how could you do
such a despicable thing?

738
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,840
How could you dishonor
our family like this?

739
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,440
I didn't...

740
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Yujue.

741
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,440
Xuan Lie.

742
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,120
Who?

743
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,280
What's going on?

744
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,000
She's unmarried.

745
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,070
How can she do this?

746
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,320
Qingming is mine.

747
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,070
No one can control his life.

748
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,960
Why can't it work?

749
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
I can't allow this.

750
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
I will find a way to save Qingming.

751
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,350
Chancellor,

752
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,710
according to Jun Yujue,

753
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,030
Jun Qiluo got pregnant before marriage.

754
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,840
I think that the child
should be Xuan Lie's.

755
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,400
She's pregnant?

756
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,510
How did the task I assigned you go?

757
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,950
Rest assured, Chancellor.

758
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,870
I've informed the leader
of the Forbidden Troops

759
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,100
about the Beixuan spy

760
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,280
appearing in the Jun Mansion.

761
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,960
Good work.

762
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,240
Leave now.

763
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,420
(Taoran Yard)

764
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,630
Let go of me.

765
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,400
You're pregnant with our child.

766
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,680
Why make me go back to Beixuan
to start a family?

767
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,840
So what if we have a child?

768
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,590
If I'd known we were having a child,

769
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,460
I could've stopped what happened today.

770
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,440
I don't care what others say,

771
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,190
but between us,

772
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,510
this child will not change anything.

773
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,840
Who says it won't change anything?

774
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,680
You think you've weighed
the pros and cons

775
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,880
and made the best decision,

776
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
but before doing that,

777
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,770
have you ever thought about my feelings?

778
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,300
(Taoran Yard)

779
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,470
Qiluo,

780
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,070
I'm not a merchant.

781
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,260
I don't understand
weighing the pros and cons,

782
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,190
but I know the instinct of a soldier

783
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,280
is to never give up
until the goal is reached.

784
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,070
I won't let go of this.

785
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
I've said what I needed to say.

786
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,800
If you truly want to protect this child,

787
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,710
no one can know his identity.

788
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,510
Now, disappear

789
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,550
from my sight.

790
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,110
Let me and the child
have a peaceful life.

791
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,800
Young Master.

792
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,170
A squad of Forbidden Troops
is heading to the Jun Mansion.

793
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,790
They say they're here for Beixuan spies.

794
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,440
They must've discovered us.

795
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,280
Change into Beixuan attire

796
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,280
and lead them away.

797
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,990
Tell He Jiyao

798
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,880
to take Qingkou from the Jun Mansion.

799
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,030
Remember to be quick.

800
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,870
Yes.

801
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,910
Wait.

802
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,760
Don't tell Qiluo,

803
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,760
or she will worry.

804
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,660
(Jun Mansion)

805
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,840
- Run!
- Chase!

806
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,430
Be careful!

807
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,360
- Who is this?
- What happened?

808
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,200
What's going on?

809
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,510
What are they capturing?

810
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,510
Who is capturing them?

811
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,720
Who?

812
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,720
Quickly.

813
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,910
This way!

814
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,210
Search inside!

815
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,550
Some of you go to the back door.

816
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

817
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,430
There's no one here.

818
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,430
There's no one here.

819
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,640
Commander,

820
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,130
no news from the two who went inside.

821
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,210
They might've been killed.

822
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,120
