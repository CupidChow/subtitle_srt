Look.

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
What are you doing?

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,520
You got upset when I hurt you before.

20
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,630
Why are you still upset
now that I kiss you?

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,400
- Great.
- Bravo.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,150
So impressive.

23
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,560
Are you alright?

24
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Hurry and run!

25
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,470
Run!

26
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,840
Run! Go!

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Be careful.

28
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,560
Run!

29
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,710
Careful! On the left!

30
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,150
Behind you!

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
The fire!

32
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,120
Young Master, we're here.

33
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
Luo Qi and He Jiyao are here.

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
How are you?

35
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm fine.

36
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
My Lady.

37
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,710
Lie.

38
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,470
Qingkou, why are you here?

39
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,030
Your eyes...

40
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,040
This place isn't safe.

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,560
Let's hurry back to find
a physician.

42
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,630
- Okay.
- Let's go.

43
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,590
How is he?

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,000
Your Majesty,

45
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
General Lie's eye injury is serious.

46
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,360
He may temporarily lose his sight.

47
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,040
How long will it take to recover?

48
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,630
I've applied medicine to the general.

49
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,680
He must rest for a month
before he fully recovers.

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
What?

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,120
But the final match

52
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,430
is in two days.

53
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Rest assured, Xu.

54
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
Even if I can't see,

55
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,310
I'll still win the match.

56
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,750
My Lady, it's getting cold.

57
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,000
You should go rest.

58
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,480
I'll stay here and wait.

59
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,160
General Lie can't see now.

60
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,560
You need to take good care of him.

61
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,720
Spread my order:

62
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,750
During General Lie's recovery,

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,560
no one is allowed

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,920
to disturb him.

65
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
Understood.

66
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,430
His eyes were injured?

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,920
They killed Mo.

68
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,430
Only his eyes were hurt.

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,560
It's too merciful to him.

70
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Don't worry, My Lord.

71
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,870
The match in two days

72
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,720
has been arranged as you instructed.

73
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,560
At that time, I'll take Xuan Lie's life

74
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,260
and avenge the young master.

75
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll kill Xuan Lie and become

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
the Wolf Lord.

77
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,590
General...

78
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,880
This...

79
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,080
- General.
- Lie.

80
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Zhizhou, Mr. Sun.

81
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,720
Lie, how are you now?

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,830
General Lie, your eyes...

83
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,190
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

84
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,040
The physician said it'll recover
in a few days.

85
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
But the final match is in two days.

86
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,830
How can you compete
with your eyes like this?

87
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,270
Xi Changkun must hate you to the core

88
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,650
because of Xi Mo's death.

89
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,200
Not only will he desperately fight
for the Wolf Lord position,

90
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,190
but I also worry

91
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,460
he'll find ways to take revenge

92
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,630
during the third match.

93
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,120
Participating in the match like this

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,920
is far too dangerous.

95
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,070
No matter what, I cannot quit.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
Zhizhou,

97
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,900
your plaques

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,600
are more than mine
and Xi Changkun's now.

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
If anything happens
to me during the match,

100
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,480
you must take the position of Wolf Lord.

101
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,360
That won't do.

102
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,240
We can't let Xi Changkun succeed.

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,830
If he gains military power,

104
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,190
the Five Clans will be in turmoil.

105
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,920
General Lie's right.

106
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,830
Xi Changkun will do anything
to seize power,

107
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,190
even sacrificing the lives
of the commoners.

108
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,430
How can he become the Wolf Lord?

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,750
In my heart,

110
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,600
the true Wolf Lord is General Lie.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,680
Don't worry.

112
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,480
I'll find every way

113
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,390
to help you win the match.

114
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,400
Lie, rest assured.

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,190
Leave it to me and Mr. Sun.

116
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Thank you.

117
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,190
In Beixuan, I'm the best medicine maker.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
I've seen Lie's injury.

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
With my medicine,

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,630
his eyes will heal in a few days.

121
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,070
What do you want now?

122
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
I'll tell you later.

123
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm going to apply medicine
to Lie first.

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,480
You stay here and wait for me.

125
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,550
When I come back,
I'll have good news for you.

126
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,670
The Queen Mother is here.

127
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
Mother, why are you here?

128
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,550
Tomorrow is the final match.

129
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,870
Lie's eyes are injured.

130
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,600
I feel truly uneasy.

131
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,630
Don't worry, Mother.

132
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,750
Lie has already promised me

133
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,840
it won't affect the match.

134
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,670
I'm glad he's confident,

135
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
but everything can happen in the match.

136
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,750
Right now, he can't see.

137
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,150
How can he guarantee he'll win?

138
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,320
This is what I think.

139
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,150
If Lie loses,

140
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,120
you should support Xi Changkun.

141
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,670
After all, he is a cousin of mine.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He'll also be loyal to you.

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,030
I won't meddle in court matters,

144
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,790
but in this situation,

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,120
I must plan ahead for you.

146
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,240
Lie is indeed the best candidate
for the Wolf Lord,

147
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,200
but if something goes wrong,

148
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,630
only one of the royals can ease me off.

149
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,670
Yes, you're right.

150
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll think carefully about it.

151
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,720
Alright, I'm tired now.

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
I'll go rest first.

153
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,270
Farewell, Mother.

154
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,750
Your Majesty.

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,910
What do you think?

156
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,870
I have no say in this.

157
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,270
Xi Changkun and Mother
are from the same clan.

158
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,000
He's ambitious.

159
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,670
If he becomes the Wolf Lord,

160
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,670
with the Queen Mother backing him,

161
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,960
will he still be under my command?

162
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
No matter the result of the match,

163
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,240
the only one who can be the Wolf Lord

164
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
is Lie.

165
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,510
Your Majesty,

166
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,720
I've asked Princess Qingkou

167
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
to treat General Lie's injuries.

168
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,150
Lie, take good care of yourself,

169
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,490
and you'll recover in a few days.

170
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,150
Qingkou, you're getting better.

171
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
I can already see faint shadows.

172
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,360
Of course.

173
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,670
I can make both poison

174
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,790
and antidotes.

175
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm much better
than imperial physicians.

176
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,480
- The King is here.
- Yes.

177
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
- Xu.
- Xu.

178
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,510
Don't stand on ceremony. Sit.

179
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,360
How do you feel today?

180
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,680
After using Qingkou's medicine,

181
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,520
I feel much better.

182
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,390
That's good.

183
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,670
You'll compete tomorrow.

184
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,790
How confident are you?

185
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,160
Don't worry, Xu.

186
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
If I really can't win the match,

187
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,030
I've asked Zhizhou

188
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,670
to compete for the Wolf Lord position.

189
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,240
I won't let the military power fall
into Xi Changkun's hands.

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,590
No.

191
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,910
This is not right.

192
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,160
Lie,

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,150
the Wolf Lord of Beixuan
can only be you.

194
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,390
In the entire Beixuan,

195
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,480
I only trust you.

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,910
Rest assured, Xu.

197
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,510
Lie, you can also rest assured.

198
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,240
Though your eyes aren't fully healed,

199
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,480
I believe they'll get better tomorrow.

200
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,510
You'll definitely win.

201
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,590
Lie,

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,790
I know this match is full of dangers,

203
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,200
but don't forget

204
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,670
the will of the late King

205
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,550
and Mr. Xuan Shu are on our shoulders.

206
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,360
Also, Mr. Sun supports you.

207
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,440
Only if we work together

208
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,600
can we develop Beixuan well.

209
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,670
In this match, you must protect yourself

210
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,320
and do your best to win.

211
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,390
Rest assured, Xu.

212
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,630
I'll do my best.

213
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,630
Alright.

214
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,460
Let's not disturb Lie's rest any longer.

215
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,560
Let's go.

216
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,790
Lie, rest well.

217
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,210
I'll come tonight for your medicine.

218
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,500
(Yuchen Palace)

219
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,320
Jun Feifan hasn't set off yet?

220
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Yes.

221
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
There have been fewer letters
from the scout recently.

222
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,140
The secret guards we sent

223
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,030
haven't shown up either.

224
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,670
If the scout shows signs of betrayal,
they mustn't be spared.

225
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,320
Your Majesty,

226
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,150
the Chancellor is waiting outside
for your order.

227
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,230
Let him in.

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,440
The Chancellor may come in.

229
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

230
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,710
Your Majesty,

231
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,720
this is the New Year's greeting letters

232
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
sent by the local yamens this year.

233
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Good.

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,670
Come on. Come here.

235
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,670
How do you like my plum blossoms
and snow?

236
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,030
Plum blossoms lack snow's pure glow,

237
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,440
yet their fragrance outshines
the winter's snow.

238
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,960
You've brought out the competition
between blossoms and snow.

239
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,390
It's wonderful.

240
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,080
Look.

241
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,360
You're the best at making me happy.

242
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,510
Your Majesty,

243
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,790
what I'm saying is from the heart.

244
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,150
Everyone in the court knows

245
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,960
your paintings

246
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,600
are top-notch.

247
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,840
Any new interesting things

248
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,270
recently in the city?

249
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,390
I heard that the Savory Tavern
has a new tea.

250
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,750
It's said to be very good.

251
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,320
Scholars have all been rushing
to try it.

252
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,360
Your Majesty,

253
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,440
would you like to go and taste it?

254
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,320
Prepare the carriage. Let's go now.

255
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,480
Yannan's current prosperity
is all thanks

256
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,630
to your efforts to boost the economy

257
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,750
by valuing merchants and opening trade.

258
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,870
You even tax the merchants.

259
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,480
The market is thriving,
and the treasury is full.

260
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,240
I didn't expect Jun Feifan

261
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,270
to be disguised by Jun Qiluo.

262
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,480
She's deceived us for years,

263
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,630
and now she's in Beixuan doing business.

264
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,080
What a capable woman.

265
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,030
Indeed.

266
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,510
She's very bold too.

267
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,240
She even secretly let
the Beixuan caravan

268
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,630
trade with us.

269
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,270
I heard from the caravan

270
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,670
that Jun Qiluo is now famous in Beixuan.

271
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,080
She's even helping the Xuan Leader

272
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,080
to fight for the Wolf Lord position.

273
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,200
How bold.

274
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,470
Qingming,

275
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,360
these are the gifts
I've prepared for you.

276
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,670
What's the meaning of this?

277
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,360
I said I have good news to tell you.

278
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,230
Qingming,

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,870
I like

280
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,150
you.

281
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,670
After thinking it over,

282
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,570
I think you are no longer suited

283
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,600
to be my servant.

284
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,510
On the Spring Festival,

285
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,720
I gave you a kiss as a reward,

286
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,150
so now you belong to me.

287
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,910
These are the betrothal gifts
I've prepared for you.

288
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,440
I want to marry you.

289
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,630
You all may leave.

290
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

291
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,390
Princess,

292
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,960
though your status is high in Beixuan,

293
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,360
I am from Yannan.

294
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,030
I don't need to fool around with you.

295
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,420
I'm not fooling around.

296
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,550
If I marry you,

297
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,200
no one in Beixuan will bully you.

298
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,870
I don't need that.

299
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,880
For Miss Qiluo,
I can endure any grievance.

300
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,680
So, is all of this

301
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,640
just for Jun Qiluo?

302
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,110
You have

303
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,790
no feelings for me at all?

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,790
I thought you knew.

305
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
General Lie, you blindfolded yourself.

306
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,720
Are you mocking

307
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,240
the rest of the clans?

308
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,000
General Lie can still
beat you like this.

309
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,310
Little men like to use dirty tricks.

310
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,310
General Lie doesn't need to see that.

311
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,640
If you have the guts,
you should compete fairly.

312
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Stop using tricks.

313
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,630
The match begins.

314
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

315
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,310
This is the final match
of this year's Hunting Event.

316
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,580
It's the territory exercise.

317
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,200
Each clan sends ten warriors
and their leaders

318
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,590
to participate.

319
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,720
There will be no eliminations
in this round.

320
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,550
The first to plant the flag on the hill

321
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,440
within an incense stick of time

322
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,280
will win.

323
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,200
Currently, the Xuan, Luo, and Xi

324
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,790
have won an equal number of plaques.

325
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,200
The Clan Leader that wins this round

326
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,270
will become the Wolf Lord of Beixuan.

327
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,750
General Lie,

328
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,030
your injury is not fully healed.

329
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,270
Stay close to me and Mr. Luo.

330
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,830
We'll make sure you win this round.

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,340
Rest assured, Mr. Sun.

332
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
My eye injury has improved a lot.

333
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,800
Everyone, stay alert.

334
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

335
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,310
Protect the general.

336
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,160
My Lord, I've gathered
all the Death Warriors.

337
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,310
We'll definitely kill Xuan Lie today.

338
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,760
Mr. Xi,

339
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,880
while they are surrounded,

340
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,510
we can rush to the hill
to plant the flag.

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,270
The Wolf Lord position
will be ours then.

342
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,110
Xuan Lie killed my son.

343
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,720
I must watch him die.

344
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,350
Be careful.

345
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,400
Qiluo, why are you here?

346
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,240
I'm here to help you.

347
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,870
Give me the bow.

348
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,070
Qiluo, you're amazing.

349
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,160
Xi Changkun must've

350
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
set a trap here.

351
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,710
It may be hard to break through.

352
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,030
The bamboo forest nearby
also leads to the finish line.

353
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,270
Why don't we change our route?

354
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,350
Mr. Sun is right.

355
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,080
Lie,

356
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,980
you and Mr. Sun go
through the bamboo forest.

357
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,750
I'll stay here to intercept Xi Changkun.

358
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,400
Can you handle it alone?

359
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,670
Don't worry.

360
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,920
Xi Changkun can't harm me.

361
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,510
Then it's settled.

362
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,590
Let's change route now.

363
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,430
Let's go.

364
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,270
He Jiyao, you stay to help Mr. Luo.

365
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,110
Yes.

366
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,750
They escaped again.

367
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,840
Mr. Xi,

368
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,790
let's go plant the flag.

369
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,750
We can deal with Xuan Lie later.

370
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,710
They must've gone to the bamboo forest.

371
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,510
You take a group of men
to intercept them.

372
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,800
I'll plant the flag.

373
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes.

374
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,480
General Lie, be careful.

375
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
We'll be turning ahead.

376
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,170
Mr. Xi has given an order.

377
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,110
100 liang of gold
for anyone who kills Xuan Lie.

378
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,950
Yes.

379
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,650
Father, time is running out.

380
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,440
You go plant the flag.
We'll cover the rear.

381
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,280
Okay.

382
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,840
Be careful.

383
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,000
Lower your head!

384
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,920
Mr. Sun, are you alright?

385
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm fine. General Lie, go grab the flag.

386
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
Sure.

387
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,910
Father...

388
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,720
The general is in danger.

389
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,960
Go help the general.

390
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,080
Yes.

391
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,590
Father, why are you lying here?

392
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,550
Get up!

393
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,240
Father, the last match is almost over.

394
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,550
Wake up!

395
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,440
Get up! Don't lie here.

396
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,280
Father.

397
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,550
Father, get up!

398
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,630
Father.

399
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,310
Don't lie here.

400
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,950
Father.

401
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,790
Get up, Father.

402
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,240
Father, get up!

403
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,520
Father.

404
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,830
Please get up.

405
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,550
- Get up, Father.
- Zhaomin.

406
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,030
- Mr. Sun is gone, Zhaomin.
- Father, get up.

407
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,550
We still have the match, Father.

408
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,240
Zhaomin, Mr. Sun is gone.

409
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,510
Go away.

410
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,030
Father, please get up. I beg you.

411
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,110
I'm begging you, Father.

412
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,590
Get up!

413
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,590
- Stop him.
- Yes.

414
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,240
Young Master.

415
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,030
How is Mr. Sun?

416
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,110
Young Master?

417
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,200
Mr. Sun... He's dead.

418
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,150
What did you say?

419
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,680
Mr. Sun is...

420
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,240
He's dead.

421
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,560
Go.

422
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,630
Mr. Luo,

423
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,440
Xuan Lie no longer has a chance.

424
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,030
If you help me
get the Wolf Lord position,

425
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,790
I'll make sure to treat you well.

426
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,350
Mr. Xi, no need for more words.

427
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,160
Even if the Wolf Lord position
isn't meant for Lie,

428
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,790
it won't be yours either.

429
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,910
Mr. Luo,

430
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,000
you've gone to great lengths to stop me.

431
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,550
Do you also want the Wolf Lord position?

432
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,320
Xuan Lie,

433
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,920
you're really a lucky one.

434
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,430
Xi Changkun,

435
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
you set up a trap to kill me,

436
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,000
but you killed Mr. Sun instead.

437
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,790
You don't deserve to be
Beixuan's Wolf Lord.

438
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,630
What are you saying?

439
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,070
Sun Ba is dead?

440
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,920
What does it have to do with me?

441
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,200
Young Master, time is running out.
Plant the flag!

442
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,500
(Xuan, Xi, Luo, Sun, Su)

443
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,790
Have you seen Qingkou?

444
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,260
Your Majesty,

445
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,190
the Princess

446
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,400
had a huge argument last night
with that Yannan slave.

447
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,770
In a fit of anger, she went back
to the Palace overnight.

448
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,750
She loves lively events.

449
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,030
Why isn't she watching the final match?

450
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,840
Never mind.

451
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,160
I feel more at ease
that she's at the Palace now.

452
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,100
She won't be entangled
with that slave anymore.

453
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,510
Your Majesty,

454
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,750
General Lie has won the match.

455
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,830
Good, good.

456
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,880
Lie didn't disappoint us.

457
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,440
Congrats, Your Majesty.

458
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,000
Spread my order:

459
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,750
I'll hold a banquet tonight

460
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,200
to celebrate the successful conclusion
of the event.

461
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
Your Majesty,

462
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,790
Mr. Sun died in the bamboo forest.

463
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,640
I've fulfilled my duty

464
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,920
and won the Wolf Lord position.

465
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,880
You can now rest in peace.

466
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,110
Zhaomin.

467
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,350
- Why are you here?
- Zhaomin.

468
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,110
I'm here to pay respects to Mr. Sun.

469
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,750
No need for your fake sympathy.

470
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,550
It's you who killed my father.

471
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,550
I want to avenge my father.

472
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,310
- Zhaomin.
- Zhaomin, calm down.

473
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,410
Qiluo, let go of me.

474
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,620
It's him who killed my father.

475
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,590
I'm going to kill him!

476
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,520
Zhaomin.

477
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,880
Zhaomin.

478
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
I'm going to kill him.

479
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,510
Killing a Clan Leader is a great crime.

480
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,750
I don't care. I'm going to kill him.

481
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,590
Zhaomin,

482
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,830
think about your clan.

483
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,540
If you die, what will happen
to the Sun Clan and Mrs. Sun?

484
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,910
Zhaomin.

485
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,760
My Lord.

486
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,800
What's wrong?

487
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,680
We've found the clue to the old soldiers
we've been searching for.

488
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,950
Where?

489
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,710
In the forest
where Xuan Lie disappeared.

490
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,110
By the time our people arrived,

491
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,480
they were gone.

492
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,150
Could it be that Xuan Lie

493
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
hid them away?

494
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,150
Xuan Lie has always had doubts
about Xuan Shu's death

495
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,960
and has been investigating in secret.

496
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,320
If he finds these old soldiers,

497
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,280
he'll bring up Xuan Shu's case again.

498
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,170
Now that Xuan Lie is the Wolf Lord,

499
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,440
after the Sacrifice Ritual,

500
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,060
we must hand over the Military Token,

501
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,520
and he won't be afraid of anything.

502
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,590
If he uncovers the truth from back then,

503
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,280
our clan will be in great danger.

504
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,670
These people cannot be left alive.

505
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,630
Keep an eye on them.

506
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,030
Once you find where they're hiding,

507
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,150
kill them all.

508
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,550
Yes.

509
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,120
Father.

510
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,980
I heard Sun Zhaomin
is going to kill you.

511
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,990
It's okay.

512
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,110
She can't hurt me.

513
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,070
Father,

514
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,800
at this Hunting Event,

515
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,190
both my brother

516
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,150
and Mr. Sun died.

517
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,480
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

518
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,800
Don't worry.

519
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,430
I'm fine.

520
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,190
I have to avenge your brother.

521
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,430
Father.

522
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,320
Jun Qiluo and General Lie

523
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,160
have never admitted
that my brother's death

524
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,150
is related to them.

525
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,480
I'm afraid

526
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,190
if we pursue this further,

527
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,710
it will cause more trouble.

528
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,640
Father,

529
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,070
let's not fight with them anymore.

530
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,550
Let's go back to our clan
and live in peace, okay?

531
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,800
Father,

532
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,190
I no longer have a brother.

533
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,230
I can't lose you too.

534
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,200
Okay.

535
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,360
As you wish.

536
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,960
After the Sacrifice Ritual,
we'll go home.

537
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,480
That's great, Father.

538
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,230
Your parents devoted their lives
to Beixuan.

539
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,320
(In Memory)
They were great heroes.

540
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,880
They were by Yannan's weapons.

541
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,400
Once you become the Xuan Leader

542
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,710
and help Xu unify the Five Clans,

543
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,320
then you will have the chance
to avenge your parents.

544
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,480
Congrats on becoming the Wolf Lord.

545
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,500
The highest place is always cold.

546
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,200
The higher the place, the colder it is,

547
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,110
and the fewer people
can accompany you to the top.

548
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,510
When you climb to a higher position,

549
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,400
you must pay the price.

550
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,920
This price may be someone else's life.

551
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,360
I hold a high position,

552
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,550
but there are many things
I can't help with.

553
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,630
I hope you

554
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,590
never have to experience this.

555
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,240
(Father,)

556
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,190
(I've finally fulfilled your last wish.)

557
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
Are your eyes feeling better?

558
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,080
Qingkou's medicine is really effective.

559
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,030
I'm fine now.

560
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,190
Mr. Sun's funeral has been arranged.

561
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,320
I'll spend more time
with Zhaomin these days.

562
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,360
Mr. Sun died because of me.

563
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,550
I must give Zhaomin

564
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,540
and the Sun Clan an explanation.

565
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,960
Don't blame yourself too much.

566
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,680
