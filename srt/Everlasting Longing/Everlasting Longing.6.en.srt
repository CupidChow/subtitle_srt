You should come lie down as well.

dwell on minor matters.

(Sun Mansion)

22
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,950
General, Miss Qi,

23
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,790
how did it go?

24
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,950
Mr. Sun, General Lie and I

25
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,390
searched for the herbs all night,

26
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,390
but to no avail.

27
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,140
This is not your fault.

28
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,950
You are skilled in business,

29
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,700
but not in medicine.

30
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,580
Mr. Sun, no worries.

31
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,070
I've sent my men
to search the Uncontrollable.

32
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,350
General.

33
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,860
How is it?

34
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,350
We asked all the pharmacies,

35
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,300
but found nothing.

36
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,140
Since you couldn't find the herbs,

37
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,950
I'm afraid
the Silver Embroidery can't continue.

38
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,270
How did it come to this?

39
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,140
Qi Luo,

40
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,580
didn't you tell me yesterday

41
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,350
that you'd find Xuan ginseng
and solve this?

42
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,140
I'm sorry, Zhaomin.

43
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,390
Mr. Xi.

44
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,390
As you bade,
we searched the Su Clan for it,

45
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,020
and have returned with all of it.

46
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,700
Mr. Sun,

47
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,420
when I heard about the illness,

48
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,940
I sent someone for the prescription

49
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,500
and went to Su Clan
to procure the herbs.

50
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,350
I thought it'd be of help,

51
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,020
but it…

52
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,580
Never mind.

53
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,910
As long as it can cure the suffering.

54
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,910
Mr. Xi, thank you for your effort.

55
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,110
- Bring it.
- Yes.

56
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,470
Quickly.

57
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,990
Get the physician to prepare it.

58
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,510
Mr. Sun.

59
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,940
Though the cultivated
Xuan ginseng is good,

60
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,470
ten of them are not as potent
as a single wild one.

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,230
General Lie and I had found it yesterday,

62
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,740
but the unexpected happened.

63
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,780
Uh...

64
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,060
We have wild Xuan ginseng.

65
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,500
I heard from the physician

66
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,500
that wild Xuan ginseng
is more effective,

67
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,300
so I paid a high price for it.

68
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,950
Mr. Xi,

69
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,790
were you deceived?

70
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,380
That's ginseng, not Xuan ginseng.

71
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,350
Impossible.

72
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,700
General Lie and I

73
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,230
deliberately took a ginseng root

74
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,080
and pretended we'd found
wild Xuan ginseng.

75
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,710
And today, a ginseng root

76
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,030
appears in Mr. Xi's chest.

77
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,790
If I'm not mistaken,

78
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,740
it was your men who pushed us

79
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,380
off the cliff yesterday.

80
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,350
Miss Qi,

81
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,420
what are you talking about?

82
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,660
Miss Qi,

83
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,940
what are you implying?

84
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,820
General Lie and I already searched

85
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,590
every pharmacy in Liangzhou yesterday.

86
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,500
They all said

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,590
the Xuan ginseng was bought up
ten days ago.

88
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,910
Yesterday, we went to Mount Qi to collect it,

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,110
but just as we found it, we were
pushed off the cliff,

90
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,740
and it was taken away.

91
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,990
And today, Mr. Xi brought
both Xuan ginseng and ginseng.

92
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,300
The truth speaks for itself.

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,420
Mr. Xi is risking

94
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,500
the lives of the Liangzhou people.

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,500
Miss Qi,

96
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,710
you cannot make accusations

97
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,940
without proof.

98
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,630
Bring them in.

99
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,630
Speak up.

100
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,060
What exactly is going on?

101
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,990
Your Honor.

102
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,030
Ten days ago, someone went through
every pharmacy in town

103
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,670
to buy up all the Xuan ginseng.

104
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,500
That doesn't mean we did it.

105
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,990
I can recognize the Xuan ginseng
from my pharmacy.

106
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,500
We got it from the Uncontrollable.

107
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
Our Xuan ginseng comes from Yannan

108
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,470
and is of good quality.

109
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,180
They are from my pharmacy.

110
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,590
What exactly is going on here?

111
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,420
The roots of Xuan ginseng
and ginseng are very similar.

112
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,230
Zhaomin, send someone
to find a ginseng root,

113
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,500
shape it like Xuan ginseng,

114
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,590
and bury it on a steep cliff

115
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,670
on Mount Qi tonight.

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,810
Mr. Luo,

117
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,670
please go

118
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,500
to the biggest pharmacy
in town tomorrow.

119
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,180
They'll have someone

120
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,110
making sure it's real.

121
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,590
To bring down that old fox,

122
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,670
we must act faster than him.

123
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,670
But how can you be sure

124
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,990
they'll take the bait?

125
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,590
Xi Changkun definitely won't,

126
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,260
but Xi Mo might.

127
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,940
You bought Xuan ginseng
ten days ago?

128
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,190
Did you

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,670
intentionally cause the eczema?

130
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,510
Mr. Sun.

131
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,790
Don't listen to others' insinuations.

132
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,790
I'd never risk people's lives.

133
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,670
Who ordered you
to cause the disturbances yesterday?

134
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,910
That man said

135
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,380
the embroidery couldn't continue

136
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,180
and told us to claim damages.

137
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,480
Someone gave me money

138
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,840
to put the fur of the dead animals

139
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,230
on the fabric.

140
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,260
I didn't know that the furs were toxic

141
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,300
and would make people sick.

142
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,830
Mr. Xi,

143
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,740
you used schemes to make people sick
and unable to work

144
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,900
while you made them come for compensation.

145
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,110
Luckily, I convinced the merchants,

146
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,500
or else the Silver Embroidery
would've gone under.

147
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,990
And that's when

148
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,470
you'd gain trust with the ginseng

149
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,140
you had prepared in advance.

150
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,310
What a good plan.

151
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,590
You're so cruel.

152
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,230
You've risked people's lives

153
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,660
for your own gain.

154
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,900
Even though you're my cousin,

155
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,230
I have to seek justice

156
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,350
for our people today.

157
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,190
Father.

158
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,030
Don't go.

159
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,470
Get out of Liangzhou if you leave now!

160
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,310
Father.

161
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,860
(Orchid Pavilion)
Qi Luo, how did I do?

162
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,830
You did great.

163
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,500
You have good martial skills

164
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,620
and you're good at acting.

165
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,540
Miss Qi Luo is such a great merchant.

166
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,190
I went to the pharmacy.

167
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,540
At first, the shopkeeper refused

168
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
to betray Xi Changkun no matter what.

169
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,180
Then, I did as you suggested,

170
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,340
paid double the price,

171
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,420
and sent them a plaque
for curing the disease.

172
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,460
He immediately agreed.

173
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,420
Miss Qi Luo,

174
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,380
how did you know Xi Changkun
would cooperate with that shopkeeper?

175
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,820
A man like Xi Changkun

176
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,420
wants fame more than anything.

177
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,260
So he only works with the most reputable one.

178
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,340
He wouldn't even
consider ordinary pharmacies.

179
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
I'm afraid his hush money

180
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,220
might go to waste.

181
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,340
They brought this on themselves.

182
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,300
Fortunately, it didn't cause any fatalities,

183
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,660
or I would've sent them to the court.

184
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,620
Qi Luo, I'm glad you're here.

185
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,180
You started laying the traps step by step

186
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
after knowing they were

187
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,460
buying up all the ginseng.

188
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,860
But going to Mount Qi was too dangerous.

189
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,140
The higher the risk,

190
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,580
the higher the reward.

191
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,700
It's the same in business

192
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,860
and everything else.

193
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,340
Once they recover,

194
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,140
the Silver Embroidery can open again.

195
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,940
General Lie,

196
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
Mr. Sun requests your presence in the study.

197
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,780
(Serenity in Simplicity)

198
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,660
Sir, you summoned me?

199
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,380
General Lie, please come in.

200
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,660
Please have a seat.

201
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,860
Please.

202
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,660
General Lie, you gave us a tax reduction,

203
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
and military supplies,

204
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,780
and helped Zhaomin
set up the Silver Embroidery.

205
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,420
Now, you've exposed
Xi Changkun's scheme

206
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,140
and resolved the eczema issue.

207
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,740
I want to thank you
on behalf of our people.

208
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,220
Mr. Sun, don't thank me.

209
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,500
When I become the Wolf Lord,

210
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,220
it's my duty to protect the people.

211
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,740
Xi Changkun has done such things

212
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,240
to the people of Liangzhou.

213
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,700
I mustn't support him.

214
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,300
However, each state is ruling on its own

215
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,780
and does not fully follow
the commands from the capital.

216
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,620
If you take the position of Wolf Lord

217
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,420
and assist the King in centralizing power,

218
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,340
the road ahead will undoubtedly be difficult.

219
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,100
You must be prepared.

220
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,660
Assisting the King in consolidating power

221
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,380
is also my parents' last wish.

222
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,220
No matter how hard the path,

223
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,340
I will never give up.

224
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,380
Back then, General Xuan Shu and his wife

225
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,900
worked for years on this matter,

226
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,380
but unfortunately, they died in an accident.

227
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,620
Mr. Sun,

228
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,860
was that really an accident?

229
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,380
When my parents died in the Uncontrollable,

230
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,500
you were the first to reach the scene.

231
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,860
Didn't you find anything suspicious?

232
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,100
Mr. Sun,

233
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,780
I'm of the same clan as him,

234
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,260
and I'm determined to be the Wolf Lord.

235
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,020
I can assure you,

236
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,900
if Miss Sun becomes the head of the Sun Clan,

237
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,660
my Xuan clan will protect her.

238
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,020
When I arrived there back then...

239
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,380
(Leather City)

240
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,820
I came back

241
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,460
and drew the pattern.

242
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,860
But for fear of bringing trouble,

243
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,620
I kept it to myself

244
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,940
and never told another soul.

245
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,620
But now Xi Changkun is trying to seize power,

246
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,060
disregarding the lives of our people.

247
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,260
I think it's time for me to take a stand.

248
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,420
Do you know

249
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,340
the meaning of this totem?

250
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,740
I've been paying close attention

251
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,940
over the years,

252
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,780
but I haven't found anything.

253
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,060
Luo Qi,

254
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,340
have you seen a similar pattern in Beixuan?

255
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,420
Yes.

256
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,780
Sir.

257
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
Where is this from?

258
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,820
It's the tattoo
on the neck of the Death Warrior

259
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,340
who attacked the caravan leader.

260
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,860
When he saw that we tricked him,

261
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,100
he took poison and died.

262
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,700
I saw this tattoo on him

263
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,540
so I drew it.

264
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,100
Sir,

265
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,260
could the mastermind
behind that case

266
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,820
be related to the case

267
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,980
of the clan leader and his wife?

268
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,940
They died under the weapons
of the Baigong Heirs.

269
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,100
Beixuan and Yannan must've
been in cahoots.

270
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
Someone is conspiring
with the Baigong Heirs.

271
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,460
Looks like only capturing Jun Feifan

272
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,620
can give me the answer.

273
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,300
General,

274
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,860
what brings you here so late?

275
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,980
It's Luo Qi's birthday in a few days.

276
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,340
There's this pattern he likes a lot.

277
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,460
I'd like to ask the embroiderer to make it.

278
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,660
Is that okay?

279
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,620
Of course.

280
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,820
What's the pattern look like?

281
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,180
No problem. I'll arrange it.

282
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,740
Have you seen this pattern before?

283
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,220
I've never seen it.

284
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,260
You've been traveling
with your young master

285
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,180
and you've seen a lot.

286
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,580
Haven't you seen it?

287
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,500
Is that a fish or a cat?

288
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,620
Forget it.

289
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,420
It's getting late. I'll leave you be.

290
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,740
Good night.

291
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,460
I'll get it done.

292
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:44,020
(Savory Tavern)

293
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,420
Sir,

294
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,060
the young master's been waiting for you.

295
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,180
Mr. Zheng.

296
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
No, it's too serious.

297
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,060
Mr. Zheng.

298
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,340
Mr. Zheng, you're here.

299
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,540
Please take a seat.

300
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,940
Please sit.

301
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,460
Why did you invite me here?

302
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,860
What do you want?

303
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,020
Nothing much.

304
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,180
I heard from my uncle

305
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,380
that when the minister knew
that my cousin's missing,

306
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,940
he sent more men to look for him.

307
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,660
So this banquet

308
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,020
is a small gesture from me.

309
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,540
The minister is too busy with state affairs

310
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,380
to be bothered.

311
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,020
However, since you are

312
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,780
a trusted person of the minister,

313
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,420
it's a great honor to have you here.

314
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,060
- Cheers.
- You shouldn't have.

315
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,620
Why so glum?

316
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,700
Everyone knows

317
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,820
that my cousin is a good businessman.

318
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
I've been with him

319
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,340
ever since I can remember.

320
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,820
I've learned a lot from him.

321
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,140
I wanted

322
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,300
to assist him for life,

323
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
but that incident happened.

324
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,580
But, sir,

325
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,460
that's not the point.

326
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,660
My cousin

327
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,340
was protected and supported by the minister

328
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,140
to help the Jun family rise.

329
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,020
However,

330
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,780
if my cousin doesn't return,

331
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,740
and I, Jun Yujue,

332
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,940
am the only heir of the Jun family,

333
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,020
will the minister still offer support?

334
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,580
I get it.

335
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,140
You want to ask
if the minister would support you

336
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,900
as the head of the Jun family

337
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,940
if Jun Feifan never returns,

338
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,460
right?

339
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,940
Mr. Zheng,

340
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,580
you really are the minister's man.

341
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,060
Nothing escapes you.

342
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,260
Actually, it's for the sake

343
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,500
of Yannan's development.

344
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,300
Our Jun family always wants to serve Yannan.

345
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,820
Heaven can bear witness to our sincerity.

346
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,180
I understand what you mean.

347
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,020
The minister supported Jun's first branch

348
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,600
because Jun Feifan

349
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,420
accomplished some deeds.

350
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,580
If you want the minister's support,

351
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,500
you'll have to

352
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,820
at least

353
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,580
demonstrate some real abilities.

354
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,820
What do you think?

355
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,060
Mr. Zheng,

356
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,140
you have my word.

357
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
I, Jun Yujue, will do my best

358
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,220
and leave no stone unturned.

359
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,620
Have a look.

360
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,060
Does this look good?

361
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,900
Yes.

362
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
I'll buy you this one.

363
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,500
How much is this?

364
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,460
One wen.

365
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,910
- (Just let them know)
- So cheap.

366
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,300
- (the princess is here,)
- And this one?

367
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,580
- (and Xuan Lie's men will come.)
- It's one wen too.

368
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,660
Please come in.

369
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,340
They're all too cheap.

370
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,420
This is no fun.

371
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,820
Let me take you somewhere fun.

372
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,980
(Virtuous Casino)

373
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,420
Great!

374
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,420
You two look new.

375
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,260
First time here?

376
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,140
That way. That's fun.

377
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
Small.

378
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,140
Small again.

379
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,500
Come on. Move it.

380
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,340
Come here.

381
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,210
Take a look.

382
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,060
Place your bets.

383
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,420
Over five is big, and under five is small.

384
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,860
Cup open, winner is out.

385
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,740
Bet on big or small.

386
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,580
Have a try.

387
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,180
Come on.

388
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,420
- I bet on big.
- Okay.

389
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,140
- Here we go.
- All right.

390
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,220
Small.

391
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,540
It's okay.

392
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,460
You'll get better.

393
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,060
You'll win it back.

394
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,340
Come on. Place your bets.

395
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
I bet on big.

396
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
All right.

397
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,460
It's a shame.

398
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,380
Have another try.

399
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,020
Keep going.

400
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
Come on, guys.

401
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,540
Bet on big or small.

402
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,260
Place your bets now.

403
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,460
That girl's still betting.

404
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,660
I'm all in. Big.

405
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
Open it.

406
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,900
Okay.

407
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,780
Let's see.

408
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,260
Open it.

409
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
- Small.
- It's a shame.

410
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,940
She lost it all.

411
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,260
How dare you cheat in front

412
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,340
of the Princess of Beixuan?

413
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,140
What princesses?

414
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,700
Now that you're here,

415
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,180
you have to play fair.

416
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,340
You're cheating.

417
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,180
Give it back.

418
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,470
- How dare you?
- My money.

419
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,730
- How dare you?
- If you cheat,

420
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,840
you'll have to return it all

421
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,980
to the princess.

422
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,340
So you're saying I get all this money?

423
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,460
It's so easy to win.

424
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,980
You're trying to rob me, huh?

425
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,860
A robbery.

426
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,820
It's a robbery.

427
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,340
This is your Princess of Beixuan.

428
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,820
Whatever. Go get them.

429
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,980
Go!

430
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,300
- What?
- Wait for me outside.

431
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,980
Good shot.

432
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,220
They deserve to be beaten.

433
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,500
(Virtuous Casino)
Well done.

434
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,940
Those guys deserve it.

435
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,500
Here.

436
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,740
Here you go.

437
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,020
Not bad, coming out so soon.

438
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,660
That's what I'm talking about.

439
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,780
You're different from the other slaves.

440
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,140
Where's your money?

441
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,380
I felt sorry for them,

442
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,420
so I gave it to them.

443
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,660
Why don't you thank the princess?

444
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,420
Thank you, Princess.

445
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,500
Thank you, Princess. You're so kind.

446
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,940
Thank you, Princess.

447
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,300
Thank you, Princess.

448
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,380
Thank you, Princess.

449
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,660
(Silver Embroidery)
Tie it all up.

450
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,500
Over there.

451
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Tie it up properly.

452
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,140
Got it. It's done.

453
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,300
Make sure it's secured.

454
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,660
Slow down.

455
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,980
Miss Qi.

456
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,020
How's the prep going?

457
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,220
It's done.

458
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
Here's a letter

459
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,790
for Jun Chengliu, head of the Jun family.

460
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,630
Please make sure to hand it over personally.

461
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
I will, Miss Qi.

462
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,940
Consider it's done.

463
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,820
If there's nothing else, we'll be on our way.

464
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,660
Good.

465
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,140
Qi Luo.

466
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,980
Here.

467
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,540
I'm so sorry.

468
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
You asked me to find you some raw stones,

469
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,460
but I got busy and forgot.

470
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,300
I had my dad take

471
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,260
all the raw stones here.

472
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,820
See if there's anything you want.

473
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,700
These are all the stones

474
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,980
in Liangzhou?

475
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,420
All the Xuan ones are here.

476
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,780
So? Do you have the stones you need?

477
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,260
But this is all there is.

478
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,620
It's all right.

479
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,380
It's getting late.

480
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,860
You should go back and rest.

481
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,460
Good night.

482
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,300
Sir,

483
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,050
Jun's goods have been left in Liangzhou

484
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,180
as Mrs. Sun's birthday gift,

485
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,940
according to Miss Qi Luo's wishes.

486
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,340
On this trip,

487
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,940
it's all thanks to Miss Qi Luo.

488
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,020
Beyond her loyalty and righteousness

489
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,940
in helping you with the embroidery,

490
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,020
she's resourceful
to solve the epidemic.

491
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,740
She is, without a doubt,

492
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,900
a blessing to you.

493
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,940
I'm the founder of the Silver Embroidery.

494
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,380
I'll take responsibility for what happens.

495
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,740
I trust you.

496
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,700
I'll take the odds.

497
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,820
General...

498
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,100
Can you let go of my hand now?

499
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,820
No way.

500
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,220
Sir,

501
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,220
you were smiling.

502
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,180
By the way,

503
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,740
do you have any idea

504
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,100
how to thank Miss Qi Luo?

505
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,700
What do you suggest?

506
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,460
We usually treat our soldiers

507
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,380
by sharing wine and food.

508
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,780
I don't know what Miss Qi Luo likes,

509
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,380
but girls like flowers.

510
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,860
They love beauties.

511
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,980
So,

512
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,700
you can send flowers to Miss Qi Luo.

513
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,660
Cliché.

514
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,140
Leave me.

515
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,140
General,

516
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,820
why are you here again?

517
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Sorry to interrupt you so late.

518
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,420
If it weren't for you,

519
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,900
Sun Ba wouldn't have made his stand so soon.

520
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,420
So I wanted to thank you.

521
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,140
I heard that in Yannan,

522
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,420
plum blossoms are praised
as the noble of flowers.

523
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,620
This is for you.

524
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,580
Thank you.

525
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,220
I think you're just like Jun Feifan

526
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,260
in your boldness and confidence.

527
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,140
Although you're a woman,

528
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,500
you act like a man.

529
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,420
(Xuan Lie is a smart man)

530
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,380
(who visits a lot.)

531
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,300
(If I change back into men's clothes,)

532
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,900
(he'll suspect I'm Jun Feifan.)

533
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,380
(I'll have to get used
to being a woman)

534
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,540
(so he won't suspect me.)

535
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,060
Qi Luo.

536
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,980
Are you sure you don't want to stay

537
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,020
and be my strategist?

538
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,260
The people of Liangzhou need you.

539
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,220
I have a deal with the General.

540
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,220
Zhaomin,

541
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,820
it's rude to poach someone

542
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,780
in front of General Lie.

543
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,820
Who wouldn't want to keep the talent?

544
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,260
I'm going to be the head
of the clan someday.

545
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,630
It's natural to look for talent.

546
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,820
Zhaomin,

547
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,660
it's already light out.

548
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,340
Don't delay the General's journey.

549
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,820
Qi Luo,

550
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,780
wait for me in the Royal City.

551
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,380
I'll see you on the safari.

552
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,220
All right.

553
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,180
Mr. Sun,

554
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,530
see you in the Royal City.

555
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,700
Generals,

556
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,100
have a safe journey.

557
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,020
(Jun)

558
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,380
Master Yujue,

559
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,900
what brings you here?

560
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,140
If I don't come,

561
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,780
the Jun family might change hands.

562
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,180
What are you talking about?

563
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,100
When I went to purchase today,

564
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,300
I noticed that one of the order forms

565
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,540
didn't have our stamp on it.

566
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,460
How could such a simple thing

567
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,660
- be missed?
- How can it be?

568
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,580
- Are you eyes too small to see?
- There's no way.

569
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,740
I don't get it either.

570
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,580
Why would my uncle

571
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,060
give such an important job

572
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,220
to someone who can't even open his eyes?

573
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,880
Can you see it?

574
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,380
- That's not true.
- Look closely.

575
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,680
Master Yujue,

576
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,760
I do have small eyes,

577
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,780
but my mind is clear as day.

578
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,100
The accountants are all here today.

579
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,940
All the orders were checked

580
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,860
by me and the shopkeeper

581
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,340
before they were taken away.

582
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,140
There must be something fishy

583
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,980
with this extra order.

584
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
Uncle Ling,

585
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,420
do you suspect me?

586
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,060
- No.
- I'm the young master.

587
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,500
How could I set you up?

588
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,740
That's not what I mean.

589
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,180
Well, just to be safe,

590
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,900
I'll take care of the seal.

591
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,780
I can't do that.

592
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,300
I'm the head of a jewelry store.

593
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,620
You're an outsider, after all.

594
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,740
My uncle trusts you, but I don't.

595
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,100
I can't let

596
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,460
an outsider

597
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,580
destroy our family's wealth.

598
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,420
I won't.

599
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,060
What my son said is true.

600
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,580
Hand over the seal.

601
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,740
I'm afraid I can't do that.

602
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,780
If the master comes back

603
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,140
and finds the seal missing, I'll be punished.

604
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,380
Look at you.

605
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,300
There's a reason you never got a promotion.

606
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,380
Ling,

607
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,420
you've always been smart and sensible.

608
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,300
Thank you, sir.

609
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,500
Don't worry.

610
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,580
When my brother and Feifan come back,

611
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,140
we'll return the seal.

612
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,860
Yujue and I are also
members of the Jun family.

613
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,100
Are you afraid we'll run away with the seal?

614
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,020
I didn't mean that.

615
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,180
No, no, no.

616
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,700
Sir,

617
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,820
please forgive me.

618
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,740
I can't give you the seal.

619
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,940
Ling, how dare you?

620
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,420
You dare disobey me?

621
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,030
- I didn't mean to.
- Uncle Ling,

622
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,340
I'm now talking nicely to you.

623
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,660
Don't be unappreciative.

624
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,420
Don't make me jump over.

625
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,660
- I...
- Stop him.

626
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,940
Get out of the way.

627
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,830
Sir.

628
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,580
Stop.

629
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,530
You...

630
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,940
Stop right there.

631
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,780
Stop.

632
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,620
Father.

633
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,660
My waist.

634
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,140
Jun Jiangjuan,
you hit my father in the waist.

635
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,220
Are you all right?

636
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,200
She hit my waist.

637
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm your elder.

638
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,250
How dare you hit my waist?

639
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,020
No respect, no manners!

640
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,380
My father, your brother...

641
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,980
No, your father, my brother,

642
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,260
is that what he taught you?

643
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,860
Uncle, my father is your brother.

644
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,100
You can come over
to rob him while he's away?

645
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,180
Is that what my grandparents taught you?

646
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
Jun Jiangjuan,

647
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,020
we don't allow women

648
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,460
to get involved in business.

649
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,980
It's against the family rules.

650
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,020
You have to be punished.

651
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,860
I won't get involved.

652
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,940
It's just that both the seal and the stick

653
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,420
are my family's property.

654
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,060
You'll have to get my father's approval
to take it away.

655
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,740
As long as I'm here,

656
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,940
not to mention the seal,

657
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,780
you can't take away

658
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,820
a blade of grass or a grain of sand.

659
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,660
Right.

660
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,020
Jiangjuan.

661
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,540
Cousin. Uncle.

662
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,340
What's going on here?

663
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,340
We're family.

664
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
Why can't we talk this over?

665
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,860
Why make such a mess?

666
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,780
Xiukun,

667
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,140
you don't have to reason with them.

668
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,300
What kind of family are they?

669
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,870
If you don't leave now,

670
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
I'll report you

671
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,180
for stealing.

672
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,060
Jun Jiangjuan,

673
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,100
I'm telling...

674
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
I...

675
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,380
I'm telling you,

676
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,500
I have to take this seal today.

677
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,060
I've made up my mind.

678
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,380
Calm down, both of you.

679
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,820
Calm down.

680
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,420
Go away!

681
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,860
Xiukun.

682
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,020
Are you all right?

683
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,300
Hey, son.

684
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,180
Are you all right?

685
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,660
(Central Town, Beixuan)

686
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,020
Lie, that's it.

687
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,200
See you in the Royal City.

688
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,020
Let's go.

689
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,460
Welcome back, sir.

690
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,620
(Xuan Mansion)

691
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,700
(Xuan Mansion)

692
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,340
Welcome back, sir.

693
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,060
Prepare the room next to mine

694
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,180
for this lady.

695
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,540
Yes, sir.

696
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,420
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

697
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,220
Young Master ordered us

698
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,900
to serve you from now on.

699
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,660
If you need anything,

700
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,300
please feel free to ask.

701
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,300
You two,

702
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,820
go get the clothes we've prepared

703
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,660
ready.

704
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

705
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,380
You guys go get the food.

706
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,860
Young Master will be here for dinner.

707
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

708
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,660
As for you,

709
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,540
a half Yannan,

710
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,020
you don't deserve to be inside.

711
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,060
Go wait outside and watch the door.

712
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,980
You're interested in the bowstring.

713
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,660
I think it is so special.

714
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,740
It's like silk.

715
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,140
You're indeed

716
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,020
raised by the Jun family.

717
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,020
This is crafted from the tussah silk

718
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,860
of Beixuan.

719
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,660
How do you think it compares

720
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,700
to other bowstrings?

721
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,340
I don't know bowstrings.

722
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,140
I've only heard the young master say

723
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,860
that this silk is tougher

724
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,460
and makes warmer cloth.

725
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,660
These maids are here to serve you.

726
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,140
If you're not used to it, just let me know.

727
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,100
I'm used to being alone.

728
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,900
I don't need all of them.

729
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,340
I saw her standing in the doorway.

730
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,820
She's a quiet girl.

731
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,580
Just let her come in and stay.

732
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,740
Ma'am, you've no idea

733
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,750
that Dongyin is half Yannan.

734
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,100
She doesn't deserve to serve you.

735
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,020
Just let her be a toilet cleaner.

736
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,660
So, a Yannan woman here

737
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,580
can only be a toilet cleaner?

738
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,380
Get out.

739
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,920
- Get out, all of you.
- Yes.

740
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,220
Come on in.

741
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,420
Thank you for your kindness.

742
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,300
I will serve you well from now on.

743
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,820
Are you wearing

744
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,260
Jun's brocade from Yannan?

745
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,260
Why are you hiding it?

746
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,700
Are you ashamed to wear it?

747
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,900
No, ma'am.

748
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,500
My mother left it to me.

749
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,540

I'm half Yannan, half Beixuan.

751
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,300
So, I'm not welcome here.

752
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,860
I won't wear it anymore.

753
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,980
Why not?

be craving for it.

758
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,300
