(The Uncontrollable)

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,630
Your Majesties.

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,150
Do you know that Su Yande
was shot dead at the border

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
by Yannan's Three-bow Crossbow?

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,590
I've heard it.

23
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,620
We have no generals
at the front lines now.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,190
As the Wolf Lord,

25
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,500
you refuse to lead your troops
into battle

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
and watch your comrades die.

27
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,960
Can you have peace in your heart?

28
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,030
Xu,

29
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,470
war only brings harm
to the people of both nations.

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,080
I sincerely beg you to stop it

31
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,800
for the sake of the people of Beixuan.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,520
How dare you

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,120
repeatedly defy my orders!

34
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,030
Present it.

35
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,190
This is a Yannan weapon
seized on the battlefield.

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,840
The Baigong's heir has died.

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,120
The King and I have never expected

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,750
that Yannan still has

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,630
the new weapons she left behind.

40
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,080
This battle is extremely difficult.

41
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,960
We can only

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
rely on you now.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Your Majesty,

44
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,190
compared to the one

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,910
that killed my father back then,

46
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,090
this crossbow's been improved.

47
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,850
Su Yande caused a conflict
at the border,

48
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,700
yet he couldn't hold out
for even three days.

49
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,120
Even if I lead the troops,

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
I can't guarantee victory.

51
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,920
Stopping the war and seeking peace
is the best strategy.

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,870
We've been preparing
to attack Yannan for years.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,000
The border is fully prepared.

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
If we withdraw,

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,400
Zhao Guang will laugh at us.

56
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,270
Your Majesty,

57
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,690
if we have no winning strategy,

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,300
it's always the commoners who suffer.

59
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,180
It'd be better
to propose peace talks now.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,800
Establishing a trading post
in the Uncontrollable

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,520
and stabilizing the three nations
is the general trend.

62
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,630
Your Majesties,
please reconsider the trading post.

63
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,800
Peace talks?

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,360
What if I insist
that you lead the troops into battle?

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm afraid I can't obey that order.

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,440
You...

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You may leave now.

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,040
The King and I will deliberate further.

69
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,700
The structure of the crossbow

70
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,290
from earlier is complex and precise.

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,070
Is this really your final creation?

72
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Perhaps

73
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,560
I should visit the place
where you once lived.

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
Young Master.

75
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,950
Go back to pack up.

76
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,430
We're going to Yannan.

77
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,880
Yannan?

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
Let's go.

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,750
Lie's being

80
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,390
stubborn and lawless.

81
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,560
He doesn't resemble a Wolf Lord at all.

82
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,680
Lie was right.

83
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,160
Yannan has these new weapons.

84
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,870
If war truly breaks out,

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,720
we might not have the upper hand.

86
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,870
Rushing in is no longer advisable.

87
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,040
Lie refused to lead the troops.

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,600
We have no valiant generals.

89
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Even if you don't want to,

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,750
we can only seek peace now.

91
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,030
Forget it.

92
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,870
I'll send an envoy to Yannan soon.

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
Your Majesty,

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,870
good news from the border.

95
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,120
Su Yande, Beixuan's Su Leader,

96
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,070
was shot dead by our general
with a Three-bow Crossbow.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,360
He died immediately.

98
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,310
Xuan Xu has unified the Five Clans.

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,310
His target is indeed Yannan.

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,240
But why didn't he send
the new Wolf Lord this time?

101
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,680
This Su Leader was always reckless.

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,680
Not long ago,
he handed over the Su Clan Seal.

103
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,830
I guess he was eager to claim credit.

104
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,510
His territory is close to our Yannan,

105
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,800
so he couldn't wait
to bring his troops to invade.

106
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,750
But who knew
he'd be shot dead immediately

107
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,040
by the modified Three-bow Crossbow?

108
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,480
Since Xuan Xu was young,
his mother had been holding power.

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,160
Now that he holds power,

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,950
he has to make some achievements

111
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,270
to convince the public.

112
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,240
If there's someone to blame,

113
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,830
they can only blame themselves

114
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
for losing Jun Qiluo.

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,760
Your Majesty,

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
speaking of Jun Qiluo,

117
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,070
she's been waiting outside
for quite some time.

118
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,600
Do you wish to see her?

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

120
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,630
Good. You may rise.

121
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,670
Your Majesty,

123
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I've completed the Three-bow Crossbow.

124
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,390
I've heard that you've started using it.

125
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,720
I wonder when my family
will be released.

126
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,120
Do you know

127
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,920
Beixuan has come to attack Yannan?

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm aware of it.

129
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,040
Thanks to the weapon you modified,

130
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,720
otherwise,

131
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,830
the suffering would fall
on the commoners of Yannan.

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,120
What are your thoughts on this war?

133
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,750
I dare not comment on state affairs.

134
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,310
It's fine to say.

135
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,120
I think you should

136
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,950
consider peace talks with Beixuan.

137
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,600
They provoked us first,

138
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,420
yet you want me to consider peace talks?

139
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,360
Do you think I'm afraid of them?

140
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Of course not.

141
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,830
I know you never fear Beixuan,

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,600
but what you said earlier was right.

143
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,240
Whoever starts the war,

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,830
it's always the commoners who suffer.

145
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,440
You're most compassionate
toward the people's suffering.

146
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,630
That's why, over the years,

147
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,040
you've focused
on developing our economy,

148
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
so the people

149
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,750
can live better lives.

150
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,950
Therefore, I dare to guess

151
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,720
that you don't wish for war

152
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,270
and have long planned for peace talks.

153
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,670
I truly didn't mistake you.

154
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,150
I've been thinking of ways

155
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,360
these days to keep

156
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,320
someone as talented as you in Yannan.

157
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,030
Since you're so clever,

158
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,600
why don't you think of a way for me?

159
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Your Majesty,

160
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,750
I don't know what you're saying.

161
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,960
You've passed the age of marriage.

162
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,440
My Prince is talented
in civil and military affairs

163
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,910
and handsome.

164
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,960
He's a perfect match for you.

165
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,470
Your Majesty,

166
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,810
I can't marry the Prince.

167
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,080
Are you going to defy my orders?

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
I dare not.

169
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,870
It's just that I come
from a merchant family.

170
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,750
My status is too low

171
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,920
to marry the Prince.

172
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,150
No one cares about the background
of a concubine.

173
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,670
Rest assured.

174
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,440
(If I don't agree,)

175
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
(my father and sisters
won't be released.)

176
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,370
Thank you for granting the marriage.

177
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,480
I have one more request.

178
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Tell me.

179
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,910
As Jun Feifan,

180
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,440
I've always dressed as a man,

181
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,910
so I dare to ask

182
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
for a grand wedding.

183
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,320
I want to sew my bridal gown

184
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,720
to make up for the years
I've lived as a man.

185
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,110
Alright.

186
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,790
You're marrying a Prince.
It's acceptable.

187
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,550
You may leave now.

188
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,870
Yes.

189
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,600
Send a gift to the Jun Mansion.

190
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,750
Tell her

191
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,630
I won't wait too long.

192
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,470
Yes.

193
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,630
You've been pardoned by the King.

194
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,600
You may leave.

195
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,820
It must've been Feifan who saved us.

196
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,600
Father, we can go home now.

197
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,560
Father.

198
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,470
Wait a moment.

199
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,510
The King requests
that Mr. Jun go to the Palace.

200
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,390
You need not worry.

201
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,960
Since the King has pardoned our family,

202
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,630
he won't make things hard for me.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,150
You hurry back.

204
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,600
There are many matters at home.

205
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,080
Go help out Feifan.

206
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,110
Go.

207
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,160
You guys.

208
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,240
Clean up that side.

209
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,630
Xiukun, Jiangjuan.

211
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,030
Feifan.

212
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,380
(Great Blessings)

213
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,750
I knew it was you who saved us.

214
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,120
You should call me Qiluo from now on.

215
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Shuting.

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
You're here.

217
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,000
(Zheng Shuting, Yannan)
You're Xiukun's elder sister?

218
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,720
I've heard from Xiukun

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,750
that you resemble Feifan the most.

220
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
Now that I see you, it's indeed true.

221
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,390
You must be Mr. Zheng, Xiukun's fiance.

222
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
Yes.

223
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,030
- I...
- Qiluo.

224
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,360
Since Feifan isn't here,

225
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,910
how did you manage to save us?

226
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,320
Feifan couldn't escape from Beixuan.

227
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,270
He chose to die to prove

228
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,500
that he hadn't betrayed Yannan.

229
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,870
When I heard of Feifan's death
in Qian City,

230
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,480
I rushed back to meet the King.

231
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,000
Did Feifan really die in Beixuan?

232
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,360
Miss Qiluo even saw the King?

233
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,000
I petitioned as a royal merchant

234
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,540
and used all connections.

235
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,180
It took a month to meet the King.

236
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,100
The King has pardoned the Juns,

237
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,140
so you need not

238
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,660
feel inferior.

239
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,500
Those who look down on you

240
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,620
are the shallow ones
who can't tell right from wrong.

241
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,060
But Qiluo,

242
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,100
the jailer said the King kept Father
in the Palace.

243
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm a little worried.

244
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,340
Don't worry.

245
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,540
The King just kept Father

246
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,060
to discuss the new alliance.

247
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,300
That's good.

248
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,660
Feifan was a man of proud bones.

249
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,780
He was truly admirable.

250
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,660
But a woman always depends on a man.

251
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,940
After his death,

252
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,860
your family has no male heir to rely on.

253
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,700
What will you do from now on?

254
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,620
A woman always depends on a man?

255
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,180
After Xiukun marries you,

256
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,300
how will she rely on you?

257
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,660
I'll make Xiukun the Lady of Honor.

258
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,220
Xiukun doesn't want promises.

259
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,020
She wants a husband who is reliable.

260
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,700
Don't just say nice words.

261
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,380
If you fail the imperial exams...

262
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,420
How unlucky that is.

263
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,820
Today is our first meeting,

264
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,980
and you're already cursing me?

265
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,820
I was only reminding you.

266
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,100
Xiukun has many things she can't say,

267
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,980
so it's up to me as her elder sister
to remind you.

268
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,220
If I had known that you see me this way,

269
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,460
I wouldn't have come today.

270
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,460
Shuting...

271
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,820
Zheng Shuting is proud and arrogant.

272
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,460
He can't bear the slightest criticism.

273
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,580
If Xiukun continues
to indulge him like this,

274
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,980
she'll definitely suffer.

275
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,220
Qiluo,

276
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,940
when did you become
so knowledgeable about romance?

277
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,420
How did Father's leg get injured?

278
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,360
- My poet friends have been
- Shuting.

279
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,900
mocking me because you were imprisoned.

280
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,640
Today, you should have come to my door

281
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,540
to apologize.

282
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,880
Instead, your elder sister
gave me a cold look.

283
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,340
Don't be angry.

284
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,460
Qiluo's words were straightforward,

285
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,260
but there was nothing wrong with them.

286
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,740
Do you think the same of me?

287
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,380
I believe you'll pass
the imperial exams,

288
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,020
but I also hope
we can act more discreetly.

289
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,460
After all, my cousin
has taken our family business.

290
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,980
He's always been wary of us.

291
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,060
If he hears your words,

292
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,300
he may make things hard for you.

293
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,260
How long will the King
keep Uncle in the Palace?

294
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,420
If Uncle doesn't return,

295
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,300
won't we have to worry every day

296
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,020
about you being oppressed
by your cousin?

297
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,860
Though Feifan and Father aren't here,

298
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,340
we still have Qiluo.

299
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,020
Though she is a woman,

300
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,820
her vision and strategies

301
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,060
are no less than a man's.

302
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,180
If we unite and support her,

303
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,340
the first branch will surely regain
its former glory.

304
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,620
(The camel that died of hunger
is larger than a horse.)

305
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,340
(There's still some time
before the exam.)

306
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,720
(The Jun family is still useful.)

307
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,860
Xiukun,

308
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,900
I wasn't angry with you earlier.

309
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,380
You have to understand

310
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,380
women in prison will be subject
to harsh criticism.

311
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,000
My family used to urge me
to break off the engagement,

312
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,820
but I only have you in my heart.

313
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,980
I want to grow old with you,

314
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,660
so I ignored everyone's objections
and came here today.

315
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,900
What?

316
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,500
Lie went to Yannan?

317
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,820
Did he bring soldiers?

318
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,340
He only brought Luo Qi with him.

319
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,980
He's learned to act without orders.

320
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,100
Now, I've sent an envoy to Yannan

321
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,160
to discuss establishing a trading post.

322
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,180
If Zhao Guang thinks I'm pretending
to seek peace on the surface

323
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
but secretly sending the Wolf Lord over,

324
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,300
what will he think?

325
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,420
Could he be trying

326
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,380
to stir up trouble again?

327
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,050
When the young master left,

328
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,720
he changed
into ordinary commoner clothes

329
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,260
and told me to report back

330
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,150
that he'd conceal his identity

331
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,580
and wouldn't provoke conflict

332
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,140
or disrupt the peace talks.

333
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,020
I truly don't understand.

334
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,380
Now that Jun Qiluo is dead,

335
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,460
why is he still going to Yannan?

336
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,700
The young master once said

337
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,120
there were still doubts
about Mr. Xuan Shu's case,

338
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,420
and Yannan was key to solving it.

339
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,500
This time, he's going for that as well.

340
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,180
Forget it. Let him go.

341
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,460
But he only has Luo Qi with him.

342
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,460
I'm still worried.

343
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,020
You must go with the pass documents.

344
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,020
If there's any news,
send a letter back right away.

345
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,460
Remember

346
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,820
to protect his identity at all costs.

347
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,140
Yes.

348
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,980
(Qinghua Palace)

349
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,180
Someone, come!

350
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
Princess.

351
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Let everyone come in.

352
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,820
Yes.

353
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,140
This is a new fragrance I've created.

354
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Come and smell it.

355
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,000
What are you all waiting for?

356
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,740
Xu only forbids me
from leaving the Palace.

357
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,540
He didn't tell you to ignore my orders.

358
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,220
Come on!

359
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,180
Come here.

360
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,900
Form a circle.

361
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,940
Everyone must smell it,

362
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,740
or you can't leave. Do you hear me?

363
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,300
Come on, smell it.

364
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,860
King!

365
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,020
King!

366
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,940
I just went to Qinghua Palace

367
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,020
and found all the servants knocked out.

368
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,620
After questioning, I learned

369
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,900
that Qingkou put a sleeping potion
in the fragrance.

370
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,420
While the servants were unconscious,

371
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,380
she sneaked away.

372
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,220
What?

373
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,580
Ask today's guards to come.

374
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,550
Yes.

375
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,940
The Princess left the Palace
with Deputy He.

376
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,980
Since Deputy He was sent by the King,

377
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,220
I thought

378
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,380
the Princess was also acting
on the King's orders,

379
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,940
so I didn't stop her.

380
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,460
I failed in my duty.

381
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,820
Please punish me, Your Majesties.

382
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,100
Go and accept your punishment.

383
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,900
Yes.

384
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,420
It seems that Qingkou

385
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,300
must've gone to Yannan with He Jiyao.

386
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,180
Yannan is far away.

387
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,700
Without anyone to care for her,

388
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,860
if she encounters danger on the way,

389
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,100
what should we do?

390
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,020
King, send someone to bring her back.

391
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,860
Mother,

392
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,100
Qingkou's been locked for over a month.

393
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,380
She must've endured enough.

394
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,020
If we try to force her back

395
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,700
just after she escaped,

396
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,500
it will likely cause more trouble.

397
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,980
You wouldn't want to repeat the past,
would you?

398
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,540
I think we should let her go this time.

399
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,020
I'll send someone to deliver
a message to He Jiyao

400
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,860
to ensure he takes good care of Qingkou.

401
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,420
If there's danger,
he'll bring her back at once.

402
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,620
Qingming,

403
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,860
wait for me.

404
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,860
Princess, wait for me!

405
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,060
(Moon Palace)

406
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,800
It's a little cold now. I'll heat it up.

407
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,780
Never mind.

408
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,540
The Palace's charcoal
has been deducted by those eunuchs.

409
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,880
If it's cold, let it be.

410
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,840
It's enough to fill my stomach.

411
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,580
Cold porridge is fine.

412
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,280
Why is it sour,
yet still brought to you?

413
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,140
You may be confined by the King,

414
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,340
but you're not an animal.

415
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,060
Why treat you like this?

416
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,460
After Yi was sent away,

417
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,660
I lost my support.

418
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,940
Naturally, everyone could bully me.

419
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,220
I wonder if Yi is doing well.

420
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
He's always had a weak constitution.

421
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,000
How could he survive
in such a desolate place

422
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,860
like the frontier?

423
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,540
Your Ladyship,

424
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,980
you must stay strong.

425
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,580
One day, Prince Yi will return.

426
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,260
(Luo Residence)

427
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,340
Once you leave for Xixiang,

428
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,900
I don't know when you'll return.

429
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,420
So, I've made some milk cakes

430
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,020
that you love.

431
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,820
Miss Jun whom you once brought back

432
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,900
really liked them.

433
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,660
Nanny,

434
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,140
we are leaving.

435
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,820
Dongyin.

436
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,860
Young Master,

437
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,220
when you reach Xixiang,
have someone tell us you're safe.

438
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
The deceased are gone;
the living must carry on.

439
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,100
Life must move forward.

440
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,060
Yes, My Lord.

441
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,860
(Pear Alley)

442
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,420
- Fresh flowers!
- (Qimin,)

443
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,940
(I must regain our family business)

444
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,780
- (before my father returns.)
- Trinkets!

445
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,980
- Pendants!
- (These days,)

446
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,700
(come with me
to check out some new shops.)

447
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,580
(If we can't take back
Brocade Embroidery,)

448
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,420
(we'll have to find a new shop)

449
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,540
(and rebuild our reputation.)

450
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,140
It's been two days,

451
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,420
and we've visited many streets.

452
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,580
The shops are

453
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,220
either priced higher or rented out.

454
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,140
It's normal for a busy district,

455
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,380
but it's just behind the Jun Mansion.

456
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,180
There aren't usually
so many people around.

457
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Let's look at this one.

458
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,740
(Yihuan Workshop)

459
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,060
Sir.

460
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,340
- Sir.
- Remember

461
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,220
everything I told you.

462
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,980
Isn't this my cousin
who's always capable?

463
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,180
Why is it you again?

464
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,020
Want to hit me, huh?

465
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,180
Come on, hit me.

466
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,260
So, it's you behind all this.

467
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,580
You were a man before,

468
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,980
so business was easy.

469
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,420
But now that you're a woman,

470
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,500
what do you have to compete with me?

471
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,420
Let me guess.

472
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,380
You've been turned away

473
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,780
from other shops, right?

474
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,220
Jun Yujue,

475
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,140
are you keeping the workshop open

476
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,380
with such underhanded methods?

477
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,460
In business,

478
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,380
as long as you hold the money,

479
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,740
does it really matter how you do it?

480
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,400
Young Master, don't worry.

481
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,860
I've remembered everything you said.

482
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,980
Qiluo, no need to see me off.

483
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,340
I can walk on my own.

484
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,180
Take care.

485
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,220
- Sorry...
- No need to say more.

486
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,700
I understand.

487
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,820
Let's go.

488
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,500
Take the bet!

489
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,620
Every time I see Jun Yujue,

490
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,380
it gives me a headache.

491
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,660
If he could use his cleverness

492
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,660
for good,

493
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,540
maybe he could achieve something great.

494
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,540
Jun Yujue is constantly wary of you.

495
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,460
Today, he even came to Pear Alley.

496
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,420
It seems he's out of options.

497
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,060
There's always a flaw in every plan.

498
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,700
There will always be
something he misses.

499
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,980
Just buy this,

500
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,260
and you'll be fine.

501
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,900
Young Master,

502
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,260
this place really is different
from Beixuan.

503
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,100
You can smell the flowers in the street.

504
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,540
Miss, look at the flowers.

505
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,620
Sir,

506
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,180
buy a sugar painting for your wife.

507
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,880
I didn't expect sugar paintings
to be made in the shape of wolves.

508
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,580
Why are you giving me this?

509
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,620
There are so many other cute designs.

510
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,780
Miss, you may not know.

511
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,260
Wolves are pack animals.

512
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,180
They're unyielding, brave,

513
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,660
and more importantly,

514
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,860
they are loyal to love.

Mr. Zhang, don't worry.

553
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,480
Young Master,

554
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,060
- I'll check for rooms.
- Take care.

555
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,220
Hello, sir.

556
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,680
Are you here for a meal or a room?

557
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,420
We need two of the best rooms.

558
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,260
Sure.

559
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,740
Waiter,

560
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,820
where is the Jun Mansion?

561
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,940
Are you a distant relative of the Juns?

562
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,540
I'm not gossiping,

563
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,740
but I've heard that last month,
Mr. Jun Feifan

564
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,500
committed a felony and angered the King.

565
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,340
He died outside.

566
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,380
Now, the Juns are either dead
or wounded.

567
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,620
Everyone avoids them.

568
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,460
You two are our guests,

569
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,740
so I want to advise you

570
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,980
to stop asking about them.

571
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,020
Just tell me

572
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,480
where the Jun Mansion is.

573
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,500
Go straight ahead.

574
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,020
The largest mansion by the river
is the Jun Mansion.

575
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,900
(Jun Mansion)

576
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,060
Jun Qiluo,

577
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
what a coincidence.

578
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,460
Are you going outside?

579
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,980
Let's go to the government.

580
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,380
What do you mean?

581
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,460
Who did this to your face?

582
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,300
My face?

583
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,900
How can you ask me what this means?

584
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,980
Jun Qiluo, I want to ask you
the same thing.

585
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,380
Your people hit me.

586
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,820
When did I send people to hit you?

587
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,380
You've made so many enemies outside.

588
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,820
How do you know it was me?

589
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,700
I knew you wouldn't admit it.

590
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,060
I have evidence.

591
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,900
I'll take it out...

592
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,380
Could you help me get it?

593
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,220
I can't reach it

594
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,380
with my hands.

595
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,340
See this?

596
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,380
The person who hit me
dropped this whistle.

597
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,340
It's made of Beixuan wolf bone.

598
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,660
Only you've been to Beixuan
in the Royal Capital.

599
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,040
Let's see how you defend yourself.

600
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,340
- There are wolves in the north.
- There are?

601
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,380
This item clearly isn't made in Beixuan.

602
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,860
You're too ignorant.

603
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,060
Jun Qiluo,

604
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,500
watch how you speak to me.

605
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,740
Move aside.

606
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,180
Who are those people?

607
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,700
He poisoned the arrow.

608
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,220
He wants to kill me.

609
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,690
My Lord,

610
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,820
I've been observing Jun Qiluo
for over a month.

611
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,640
There's no sign
of her turning things around.

612
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,120
She's just trying to find a new shop.

613
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,500
Jun Yujue taking the family business

614
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,260
has caused a great problem
for Jun Qiluo.

615
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,580
In that case,

616
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,820
you should help Mr. Yujue.

617
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
The Zhengs' business

618
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,460
is about to overtake the Juns.

619
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,740
We can't let their first branch
rise again.

620
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,580
Yes.

621
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,580
Chancellor.

622
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,940
How useless!

623
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,140
Someone, come!

624
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,220
Chancellor, please spare me.

625
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,340
Don't make me see him again.

626
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,380
Chancellor, please spare me.

627
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,500
Chancellor, please.

628
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,740
Stop.

629
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,260
Chancellor, calm down.

630
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,460
The bird flew away.

631
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,260
It's a good omen

632
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,940
that you'll rise to great success.

633
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,220
Killing him might ruin the omen.

634
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,440
This servant probably just got here,

635
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,580
so he doesn't know the rules.

636
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,940
But he brought such an omen.

637
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,580
I'll personally train him.

638
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,580
He'll definitely be a useful servant.

639
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,540
You know how to put my mind at ease.

640
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,780
Leave now.

641
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,980
Get up.

642
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,140
From now on, you'll follow me.

643
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,620
When I'm not at the mansion,

644
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
don't show up before the Chancellor.

645
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,100
Thank you for saving my life.

646
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,860
What's wrong?

647
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,060
Are you disappointed to see someone

648
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,320
who's not your master?

649
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,860
Our identities are special.

650
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,260
Anyone who learns of who we are

651
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,860
must die.

652
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,380
You may leave now.

653
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,180
Yes.

654
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,040
What else have you been hiding from me?

655
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,380
That day, I wanted to tell you

656
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,540
my code name is Kylin.

657
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,940
I'm the King's secret guard commander.

658
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,620
The Royal Surveillance is
an organization the King trained

659
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,060
to monitor officials
and wealthy merchants.

660
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,140
I've been with the Juns since I was 13.

661
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,460
Though I'm working for the King,

662
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,500
I've long regarded the Juns as my family

663
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,300
as Master and you
treated me like family.

664
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,260
I've never done anything
to betray you guys.

665
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,740
I've finally heard you say it.

666
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,900
You already knew?

667
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,700
The King knows everything about us,

668
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,900
so I've been suspicious,

669
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,500
but you've always acted so cautiously

670
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,140
these years,

671
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,780
sometimes I even doubted

672
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,980
whether I was overthinking it.

673
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,180
But we've always treated you as family.

674
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,020
Before I came here, I visited the King.

675
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,260
He said that the letter
from Beixuan discussed peace,

676
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,860
so the war wouldn't start for now.

677
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,100
He hopes I can marry soon.

678
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,380
(Jun Mansion)

679
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,610
(Jun Mansion)

680
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,460
Young Master,

681
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,140
the dead can't return to life.

682
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,180
Miss Jun's spirit in the heavens

683
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,500
wouldn't want to see you
blaming yourself like this.

684
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,860
(Jun Mansion)

685
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,660
What?

686
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,260
You want to marry Jun Qiluo?

687
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,840
Your Majesty, please grant this.

688
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,020
She knows your identity now?

689
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,980
I failed in my duty.

690
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,060
Why is the timing so coincidental?

691
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,500
I dare not deceive you.

692
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,820
My subordinate made an honest mistake.

693
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,700
Miss Qiluo is sharp-minded.

694
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,340
I couldn't keep hiding it.

695
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,980
Do you know why I want her

696
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,420
to marry the Prince?

697
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,340
I dare to speculate

698
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,820
that it's because you want to keep

699
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,540
Baigong's heir in Yannan forever

700
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,540
to work for you.

701
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,780
But the Princess loves his wife.

702
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,620
If Jun Qiluo marries the Prince,

703
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,600
it will only add more trouble for him.

704
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,860
If I can marry her,

705
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,940
I'll guard

706
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,540
the Baigong's heir for you for life

707
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,140
and I can ease the Prince's worries.

708
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,900
Have you really fallen for her?

709
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,580
I don't blame you.

710
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,980
I think you've done well.

711
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,820
If you marry her,

712
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,300
it won't draw unnecessary attention.

713
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,460
You can keep a close eye on her.

714
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,220
This is a good thing.

715
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,840
For now, there won't be any conflict

716
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,340
between Yannan and Beixuan.

717
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,220
You should choose a date
and get married asap.

718
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,620
Yes.

719
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,620
Qiluo.

720
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,820
- Fragrant pouches!
- When can we find one?

721
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,700
Pouches and sachets! Take a look!

722
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,460
Qiluo, where are you going?

723
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,180
(Lease of a Good Shop)

724
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,500
Candied hawthorns!

725
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,380
How about this?

726
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,260
Candied hawthorns!

727
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,580
Qiluo, are you sure
you want to rent this one?

728
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,300
(Song's Tea)
This is small,

729
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,740
and it's at the end of the alley
with little foot traffic.

730
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,740
It's not an ideal location for business.

731
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,580
Manager,

732
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,900
I've walked the entire street,

733
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,340
compared several shops,

734
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,420
and finally chose this rouge.

735
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,020
My lady will definitely like it.

736
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,980
Alright. I'll pack it up for you.

737
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,540
The foot traffic is indeed little,

738
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,020
but people who come all the way here

739
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,500
must be seeking good products.

740
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,500
As long as we ensure
the quality of our goods,

741
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,660
we can still make a name.

742
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,740
Good wine doesn't fear deep alleys.

743
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,900
Also, it's close to the Jun Mansion,

744
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,540
so we can save some labor.

745
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,060
Let's go find out

746
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,580
where the manager lives.

747
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,660
We can take some good tea to visit him.

748
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,820
Alright.

749
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,820
You can have a look.

750
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Please pack this for me.

751
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,180
Alright, please have a look.

752
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,340
Young Master,

753
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,180
you really shouldn't buy more.

754
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,820
We don't even know what they like.

755
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,380
Besides, the Juns don't know us.

756
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,620
They might not even let us in.

757
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,740
Qiluo likes red beans.

758
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,840
We can buy some red beans.

759
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,460
Young Master, what are you looking for?

760
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,860
(Song Residence)

761
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,700
What?

762
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,380
Jun Qiluo wants to rent the shop
at the end of the alley?

763
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,380
Such a small place?

764
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,340
Yes.

765
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,460
Jun Qiluo,

766
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,740
I never thought I'd force you
into a corner.

767
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,620
So, there's always a reason

768
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,860
that people fail.

769
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,940
Yes, yes.

770
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,580
Come here.

771
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,780
Go find the owner of that shop.

772
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,660
Offer double the price.

773
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,460
That shop must not be rented to her.

774
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,340
Understood?

775
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
Alright, I'll go right away.

776
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,420
Go ahead.

777
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,740
My Lady, we've arrived.

778
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:58,940
(Liu Residence)

779
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,320
(Liu Residence)

780
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,260
Who are you looking for?

781
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,340
Is your master at home?

782
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,700
I'd like to have a word with him.

783
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,540
Master isn't home.

784
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,820
My Lady, as you expected,

785
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,940
Jun Yujue has sent people

786
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,220
to secretly keep an eye on you.

787
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,620
There's always someone at the door.

788
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,300
Then let's stay here too.

789
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,380
Jun Yujue's people won't dare to act.

790
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,020
You go watch the back door.

791
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,340
We'll stay here.

792
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,820
Alright.

793
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,700
(Liu Residence)

794
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,020
Qiluo, should we go back?

795
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,260
Why haven't you two gone back so late?

796
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,580
Why didn't you invite me?

797
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,300
You must be frozen. Put this on.

798
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,580
Here.

799
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,420
(Liu Residence)

800
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,700
Warm your hands.

801
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,280
Perfect.

802
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,680
This year, we weren't together
to celebrate the New Year.

803
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,980
Tonight, we'll make up for it.

804
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,420
I really didn't expect

805
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,100
that starting a business
would be this hard.

806
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,140
Yes.

807
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,700
In the beginning,
it tests your patience.

808
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,680
There's so much more you need to learn.

809
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,980
Qiluo,

810
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,860
I've finally arrived in Yannan,
where you grew up.

811
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,500
Tomorrow,

812
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,900
I will visit the Jun Mansion.

813
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,020
