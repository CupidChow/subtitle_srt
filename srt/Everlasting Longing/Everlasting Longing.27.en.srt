Miss Jiangjuan,

42
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,750
have you missed me

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,390

supposed to be dead,

accused of being spies?

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
Miss Jiangjuan,

47
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,720
so you now know who we really are now.

48
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,800
Qimin and Qiluo

49
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,560
have told us about you.

50
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,910
Did you get hurt?

51
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,950
How could I possibly get hurt?

52
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm the Deputy General of Beixuan.

53
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,070
I've fought alongside
Young Master for years.

54
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm not dying that easily.

55
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,510
Right, I almost forgot.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,120
Xuan Lie forced Qiluo to jump off a cliff,

57
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,560
and caused my father to injure his legs.

58
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,510
You're his lackey, aren't you?

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
You're an accomplice!

60
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,190
I'll beat you to a pulp!

61
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,630
Miss Jiangjuan!

62
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,850
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

63
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
I can explain.

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
Wait, I have to tell my father right now.

65
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,240
How did you and Luo Qi
manage to escape?

66
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,070
Why didn't you
let me know right away?

67
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
That day...

68
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080
Luo Qi!

69
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,830
We hid in the cellar

70
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,360
and disguised the bodies
of two soldiers as our own.

71
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
That's how we escaped.

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,070
After that,

73
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,480
we planned to tell you right away,

74
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,750
but the city was heavily guarded.

75
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,920
I didn't dare to come out.

76
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,800
But I'm glad

77
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,750
you're so upset

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,750
about my fake death.

79
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,270
I'm glad

80
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,360
this incident showed me

81
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,360
how much you care about me.

82
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,720
You're happy, huh?

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
I've been miserable these days.

84
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,240
But anyway,

85
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
we're even now.

86
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,630
Don't make me worry again.

87
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,800
So, I don't need to return to Beixuan?

88
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,040
You need to go.

89
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,360
You're the Wolf Lord of Beixuan.

90
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,950
I can't be at ease with you here.

91
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,740
Qingkou and He Jiyao

92
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,430
are in the old residence of the Juns.

93
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,560
Go find them now

94
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,750
and take them back with you.

95
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,270
Alright.

96
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,120
If I return to Beixuan,

97
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,680
will you come with me?

98
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,830
Are you really going back?

99
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,350
You...

100
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,200
Mr. Jun...

101
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,830
Are you Xuan Lie?

102
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,630
You're not welcome in our family.

103
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,720
Please leave now.

104
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
- Father!
- Enough.

105
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,550
Leave Yannan immediately

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,870
and never step foot
in the Jun Mansion again!

107
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,480
Qiluo,

108
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,870
if he dies,

109
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,440
I won't oppose your relationship.

110
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,000
But since he's alive,

111
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,550
you cannot see him anymore.

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
Father,

113
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,870
I know you're worried about me.

114
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,910
But after this,

115
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
I've made up my mind.

116
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
I want to be with him.

117
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,390
You...

118
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,360
I can't lie to myself anymore.

119
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,480
I've never forgotten him.

120
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,840
Nonsense!

121
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,910
Who are you,

122
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,270
and who is he?

123
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,360
How can you two be together?

124
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,550
Qiluo, Father's right.

125
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,080
If it weren't for Xuan Lie,

126
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,510
you wouldn't have jumped the cliff,

127
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,440
Father wouldn't have injured his legs,

128
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
and our business

129
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,970
wouldn't have been taken by Jun Yujue.

130
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,840
He's to blame for the troubles in our family.

131
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,750
How can you be with such a person?

132
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,720
I think we wrongly blame him
for Father's injury.

133
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,630
I know him.

134
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,960
He wouldn't do that.

135
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,840
Honestly, this whole mess

136
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,080
is my fault.

137
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,630
Qiluo, you're smart, but why do you

138
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,480
lose your mind
when it comes to Xuan Lie?

139
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,200
She's right, Qiluo.

140
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,630
You two are not a good match.

141
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,470
Alright.

142
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,910
Leave us alone.

143
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,150
I need to talk to Qiluo alone.

144
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,870
Qiluo,

145
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,150
I hope you find a good husband.

146
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,080
If he were from an ordinary family,

147
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,080
I wouldn't stop you.

148
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,480
You're Baigong's heir.

149
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,270
If the King finds out

150
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,150
you're with the Wolf Lord of Beixuan

151
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,600
and carrying his child,

152
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,790
what will he think?

153
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,270
Now Beixuan and Yannan
are in peace talks.

154
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,670
Things won't be as tense as before.

155
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,470
Maybe

156
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
it won't be so difficult for him and me.

157
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
Father,

158
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,840
if you ask me to give up now,

159
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,960
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

160
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,720
I just want you to be well.

161
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,240
I can't control much now.

162
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,030
There's no room for this.

163
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,960
I won't allow you to be with him!

164
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,020
(Haven of Bliss)

165
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,870
Young Master,

166
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,440
they've learned about

167
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,750
how you mistreated Miss Jun,

168
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,150
and tricked Mr. Jun

169
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,390
into the Chiyan Gorge.

170
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,390
Miss Jiangjuan beat me up because of it.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,550
Also, I'm afraid Mr. Jun

172
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,270
won't allow you to see Miss Jun again.

173
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,200
What did you just say?

174
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,270
I just said that I'm afraid Mr. Jun

175
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,080
won't allow you to see Miss Jun again.

176
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,440
- Young Master, I told you...
- Chiyan Gorge?

177
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,960
I sent people to the Execution Valley,

178
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,600
not the Chiyan Gorge.

179
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,470
Yes, that's right.

180
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,150
So someone else must have
changed the location

181
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,840
to murder Mr. Jun.

182
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,150
Why are you just standing here?

183
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,470
Greet the Young Master.

184
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,560
Young Master.

185
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
You are alive!

186
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
That's great.

187
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Alright, alright.

188
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,630
Stop it.

189
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,680
Where is Qingkou?

190
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,720
My apologizes.

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,440
Last night, she knocked me out.

192
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,790
I don't know where she is now.

193
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,630
What?

194
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,200
The soldiers are still searching

195
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,360
for Beixuan spies.

196
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,360
Let's go find her.

197
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,930
No need, I'm right here.

198
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,710
Lie!

199
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,510
I knew you wouldn't die so easily.

200
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,680
Are you alright?

201
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,710
Me?

202
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm fine.

203
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,910
The situation here is tense.

204
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,510
Tomorrow, He Jiyao will
escort you back to Beixuan.

205
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,710
I'm not going.

206
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,620
Qingkou,

207
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,150
this is not a game.

208
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,510
I know.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,510
Qingming and I are married.

210
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,630
I slept with him last night.

211
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,590
What did you say?

212
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,790
Did Shao Qimin force you?

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,840
Lie,

214
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,600
he didn't force me.

215
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
I did it voluntarily.

216
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,390
I like him.

217
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,870
I want him to be my husband.

218
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,200
Xuan Lie,

219
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,270
I knew you were alive.

220
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,240
You don't even like Qingkou.

221
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,510
Why did you ruin her innocence?

222
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,150
This is between her and me.

223
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,240
It's none of your business.

224
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,670
Qingkou is the Princess of Beixuan,

225
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,080
and also my closest cousin.

226
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,550
If you dare hurt her,

227
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,440
I will never let you off.

228
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,080
If you dare hurt Miss Jun,

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,550
I will kill you.

230
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,360
Though Qingkou is naughty,

231
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,630
she's truly sensitive inside.

232
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,750
She came to Yannan to see you,

233
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,120
and you spent a night together.

234
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,080
Please don't break her heart again.

235
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,000
I admit the person
who married me is Qingkou,

236
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,550
but the only person
I care about is Miss Jun.

237
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,080
Qiluo is under my care.

238
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Don't worry about her.

239
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,980
(Jun Mansion)

240
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,080
Jiangjuan?

241
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,390
Qiluo,

242
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,000
Father said you're not feeling well

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,670
and should rest in your room.

244
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,720
I'm feeling better now.

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,630
I'm going to the shop.

246
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,670
Xiukun is there.

247
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,150
No need to worry, Qiluo.

248
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,030
Father forbids me from going out?

249
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,360
Qiluo, don't blame him for this.

250
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,480
If you go out,

251
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,000
you'll go see Xuan Lie.

252
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,480
I've always supported your choices,

253
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,320
but this time, I'm on Father's side.

254
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,750
Xuan Lie is my future nephew's father,

255
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,440
but you two cannot be together.

256
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,350
After you give birth to the child,

257
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,390
we'll raise it ourselves.

258
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,600
We won't need him.

259
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,630
Young Master, the Juns

260
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,100
(Haven of Bliss)
are on high alert.

261
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,950
They won't let us in

262
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
or Miss Jun out.

263
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,480
How can you be so calm

264
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,730
and just sit here drinking tea?

265
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,720
They are Qiluo's family.

266
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,440
They know my past with Qiluo,

267
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,960
and my true identity.

268
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,030
So they won't approve of us.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,120
Rushing in won't help.

270
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,720
We need a step-by-step approach

271
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,120
to crack the Jun family

272
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,360
from within.

273
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,000
Mr. Jun will be
the toughest nut to crack.

274
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,480
Miss Xiukun
follows his lead religiously,

275
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
so she's a dead end.

276
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,080
That leaves...

277
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,440
Miss Jiangjuan,

278
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,390
the most straightforward one.

279
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,230
We'll start with her.

280
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,200
Thank you.

281
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,870
You're right.

282
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,960
If we can get Miss Jiangjuan

283
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
on our side,

284
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,960
it's like having an ally

285
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,510
in the Jun family.

286
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,720
Then I believe
you'll be able to persuade

287
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,870
other Juns soon.

288
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,080
I'll leave this matter to you.

289
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,390
If you fail, don't come back.

290
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,880
How could I, the Deputy General,
crawl in through a dog hole?

291
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,390
Ridiculous!

292
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,670
Young Master,

293
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,550
having a subordinate like me,

294
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,110
you'll have no regrets.

295
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,440
I knew you'd come in from here.

296
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,550
Been waiting for you, you dog.

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,920
Please don't hit me!

298
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm here to give you a novel.

299
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,880
(The Shattered Jade Goddess)
See? A novel.

300
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,270
A novel?

301
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,310
The Prince loves the Fifth Lady.

302
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,880
They've been through so much together.

303
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,610
The Prince even risked his life
several times to save her.

304
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,510
He would rather go against everyone,

305
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,200
but love her alone.

306
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,910
True.

307
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,920
Miss Jiangjuan,

308
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,790
actually, the hero and heroine I created

309
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,830
are Young Master and Miss Jun.

310
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,200
The Prince here is Young Master,

311
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,350
and the Fifth Lady is Miss Jun.

312
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,310
What did you say?

313
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,190
So...

314
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,240
The stories in it are all true?

315
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,350
Of course.

316
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Young Master and Miss Jun

317
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,640
have been through so much together.

318
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,380
He loves her deeply

319
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,110
and he's willing to do
everything for her.

320
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,680
And Miss Jun also loves Young Master.

321
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,110
What you heard before

322
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,750
wasn't true.

323
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,640
Alright,

324
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,000
my beautiful and kind Miss Jiangjuan,

325
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,270
can you truly bear to see

326
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,880
a loving couple

327
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,510
torn apart?

328
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,880
One string of coins and 300 wen each...

329
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,980
Didn't expect you to come.

330
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,440
Jiangjuan is on watch outside.

331
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,510
How did you get in here?

332
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,000
Thanks to Luo Qi's help.

333
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
Here you are.

334
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,200
You're pregnant.

335
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,590
You might feel unwell sometimes.

336
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,680
I had the physician
prescribe some herbs.

337
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,070
You can carry them
with you to ease the nausea.

338
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,070
You can't

339
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,000
walk around freely yet.

340
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,510
Why did you go to the physician?

341
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,560
Don't worry.

342
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,630
I disguised myself,

343
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,920
and no one recognized me.

344
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,240
I came to discuss
something important with you.

345
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,030
Mr. Jun encountered bandits
at the Uncontrollable.

346
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,270
It was a deliberate setup.

347
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,590
My father was in Qian City.

348
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,070
The letter was sent
from Beixuan to the Juns,

349
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,350
and then forwarded by Uncle to my father.

350
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,270
Uncle must have tampered with the letter.

351
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,880
Besides him,

352
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I can't think of anyone else who would do this.

353
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,690
You met bandits in the Uncontrollable.

354
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,080
It must have been their doing too.

355
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,070
The Jun family's second branch
wants to kill you.

356
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,110
I originally thought

357
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,000
my uncle and cousin
were merely jealous of me,

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,750
wanting to take control of the family.

359
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,110
I didn't expect

360
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,480
they'd hired assassins.

361
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
They've framed you many times.

362
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,640
What's your plan?

363
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,690
I don't have any evidence right now.

364
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,750
They won't admit to anything.

365
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,160
But I will

366
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,590
make them pay for this.

367
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,720
You're pregnant.

368
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,400
Don't overwork yourself.

369
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,590
What do you want to do?

370
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,840
I'll help you.

371
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,270
You can't travel freely now.

372
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
I have ways

373
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,000
to deal with them.

374
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,920
I know you have your ways,

375
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,950
but...

376
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,400
I want to face this with you.

377
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,830
Back in Beixuan,

378
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,750
I thought I could
handle everything alone.

379
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,160
Unexpectedly,

380
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,000
it created a rift between us.

381
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,070
So whatever happens,

382
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,400
let's face it together, alright?

383
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,590
Qiluo,

384
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,510
I'm glad I came to Yannan.

385
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,840
Otherwise,

386
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,240
I might have lost you.

387
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,400
Even though you look silly,

388
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,270
you do write good novels.

389
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,480
Miss Jiangjuan,

390
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
if you like,

391
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,070
I can write for you every day

392
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,920
as long as you don't stop Young Master

393
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
from meeting Miss Jun.

394
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,350
If he truly loves Qiluo,

395
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,480
as portrayed in this novel,

396
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,110
I wouldn't mind letting them meet.

397
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,030
Miss Jiangjuan, you're really...

398
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,350
You're injured.

399
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,100
I'll get you some medicine.

400
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,030
Why is your face so red?

401
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,510
I... I have to go now.

402
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,760
Father...

403
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
Why is he here?

404
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,670
Hi, Mr. Jun.

405
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,400
Father, why are you here?

406
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,680
Xuan Lie didn't come to see you?

407
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,750
No, Father. I've been guarding the door.

408
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,590
No one came in.

409
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,350
But why is he here?

410
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,270
I left something here earlier,

411
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,440
just came to fetch it.

412
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,350
Father, I saved him
in the prison before.

413
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,070
He's here to thank me with a novel.

414
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,160
If you want to show your gratitude,
don't come here again.

415
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,590
You're right, Father.

416
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,750
Hurry up and leave!

417
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,550
Or I'll beat you up.

418
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,750
Stop it.

419
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,590
Go now!

420
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,440
- Go now!
- Stop it!

421
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,630
- Qiluo.
- Stop it!

422
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,750
Your uncle and Yujue
came to see me today.

423
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,030
They're pleading for your mercy.

424
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,920
But they won't give up
on the family seal.

425
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,480
Do you have any plans?

426
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,750
Father, don't worry.

427
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,200
Just leave it to me.

428
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,320
Chancellor,

429
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,160
Jun Yujue is requesting a meeting,

430
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,590
saying he needs your help with

431
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,310
the Royal Procurement Office order.

432
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,790
What a loser.

433
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,000
So, should we continue helping him?

434
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,790
He's no match for Jun Qiluo.

435
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,240
Continue helping him?

436
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,310
Aren't we just wasting our energy?

437
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
By the way,

438
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,160
any news on Jun Qiluo recently?

439
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,550
After Xuan Lie died, she's been at home

440
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,550
and rarely goes out.

441
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,480
The King ordered the Royal Surveillance

442
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,960
to investigate the Beixuan spies, right?

443
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,240
Have you dealt with it yet?

444
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,000
Rest assured, Chancellor.

445
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,110
I reported

446
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,920
the spies' movements anonymously.

447
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,270
The Surveillance couldn't trace it.

448
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,200
May I ask how did you

449
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,960
discover the spies' tracks that day?

450
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,310
Someone secretly delivered this letter.

451
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,480
After I saw it,

452
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,590
I had people check
around the Jun Mansion.

453
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,070
I haven't found any clue
about the messenger yet.

454
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,240
Thank you for informing me.

455
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,670
Guards.

456
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,260
- Yes, sir.
- Check on whoever entered

457
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,650
or left the residence of the Commander.

458
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,870
Yes.

459
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,910
What's wrong with her?

460
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,480
She tried the medicine herself

461
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,680
to make a cure for you while I was away.

462
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,310
I wanted to find Young Master,

463
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,550
but she promised
to keep it a secret for you.

464
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,750
I can only ask for your help.

465
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,870
I won't die.

466
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,200
I'll be fine later.

467
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,920
Who told you to do that for me?

468
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,240
Even if I die...

469
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,550
I won't let you die.

470
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,190
Don't worry.

471
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,350
I'll make the cure soon.

Are you stunned?

I never expected one day

493
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,400
I'd visit your arsenal.

494
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
My father has left.

495
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,160
You should go back as well,

496
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,240
or people will notice you.

497

Don't worry.

498
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,830
I'll find a way to
win your father's approval.

499
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,830
I'm afraid it'll be hard for him

500
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,240
because of our identities.

501
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,310
You're pregnant.

502
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Don't overthink it.

503
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,790
Our priority now is to help you

504
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,400
regain the Brocade Embroidery

505
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,160
and produce 150,000 bolts of silk soon.

506
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,390
What's this?

507
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,210
The key to dealing with the second branch

508
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,200
and taking back the family seal.

509
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,310
Tomorrow is the delivery day.

510
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,310
If we can't deliver,

511
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,750
those owners and managers

512
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,920
will never let us off.

513
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,720
I thought the Chancellor would help,

514
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
but unexpectedly,

515
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,480
he shut us out.

516
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,070
Life has its ups and downs!

517
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,840
Yujue,

518
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,110
why don't we

519
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,480
just give them back the seal

520
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,720
and the Brocade Embroidery?

521
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,130
Let's ask them for an explanation.

522
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,440
Mr. Yujue, all my silkworms
have been used for production.

523
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,720
Can you deliver by tomorrow?

524
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

525
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,480
We've poured all our savings into this.

526
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,550
If you can't, we'll lose

527
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,160
everything we've earned these years,

528
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,880
and even face serious legal consequences!

529
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,750
- Yes.
- Can you solve this problem?

530
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,400
You're the manager of the Jun family.

531
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,070
Jun Feifan is much better than you!

532
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,000
How will you solve this?

533
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,030
We never faced these issues

534
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,310
- when Jun Feifan was in charge.
- Stop it!

535
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,640
You keep bringing up Jun Feifan,

536
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,960
but you probably don't know

537
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,350
that the current situation

538
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,510
was caused by that Jun Feifan!

539
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,480
What are you talking about?

540
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,960
What do you mean?

541
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,830
What did you say?

542
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,960
Good for you, Jun Yujue.

543
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,830
You're quite the smooth talker.

544
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,390
Jun Qiluo,

545
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,480
what are you doing here?

546
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,400
I came to enjoy this show.

547
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,320
Everyone,

548
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,270
he won't deliver the goods tomorrow.

549
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,240
What?

550
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,720
What should we do now?

551
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,710
Jun Yujue, you promised us

552
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,200
that you could solve the problem!

553
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,160
What should we do?

554
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,010
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

555
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,270
This is on you!

556
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,920
Rest assured, everyone.

557
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,310
He can't deliver it,

558
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,310
but I can.

559
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,080
Really?

560
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,830
- She can do it.
- Great!

561
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,640
What did Qiluo say before she left?

562
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,240
She said

563
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,400
she would make
Jun Yujue hand over the seal

564
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,880
and return everything to us.

565
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,960
How could your uncle and Yujue

566
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,160
easily give up the seal?

567
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,510
They'll definitely
make things difficult for Qiluo.

568
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,720
Wait, I should go there.

569
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,000
I've told my cousin

570
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,920
that I can help everyone get through this.

571
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,680
But he still can't agree to

572
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,350
my condition.

573
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,270
Ms. Qiluo, what condition?

574
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,350
What's the condition?

575
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,200
Speak your mind.

576
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,270
Jun Yujue must return

577
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,590
both Brocade Embroidery
and the family seal

578
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,880
to our first branch.

579
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,480
After all, they rightfully belong to us.

580
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,080
Jun Qiluo,

581
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,440
don't even think about that.

582
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,960
The Jun family business
is rightfully mine.

583
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,240
I, Jun Yujue,

584
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,920
am the only male heir of the Juns!

585
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,720
Not you,

586
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,440
and certainly not Jun Feifan!

587
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,400
Yujue, that's enough!

588
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,310
Qiluo, you've been heard,

589
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,920
but don't take it too far.

590
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,480
Everyone knows

591
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,110
you're part of the Jun family,

592
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,790
and helping out

593
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,160
with the family business is your duty.

594
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,880
How can you

595
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,720
use the seal and the Brocade Embroidery

596
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,310
to threaten your cousin?

597
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,960
As a member of the Jun family,

598
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,160
you are sabotaging our business.

599
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
If it weren't for you,

600
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,550
the managers and the owners

601
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,790
wouldn't be in this mess!

602
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,550
It's all her fault!

603
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,630
Qiluo,

604
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
I know

605
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,680
you hold a grudge against Yujue and me.

606
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,000
But you can't

607
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,590
drag everyone down.

608
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,160
How can you do this to us?

609
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,000
Exactly.

610
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,270
They are so shameless.

611
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,590
Uncle, Yujue,

612
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,680
how can you do this to us?

613
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,150
Look.

614
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,790
No one could have imagined

615
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,400
who sent this letter.

616
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,960
You're making a mystery out of this?

617
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,520
This letter

618
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,350
was sent by the ruthless bandits

619
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,920
from the Uncontrollable.

620
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,880
The Uncontrollable...

621
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,440
Bandits...

622
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,960
This letter was supposed

623
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,070
to be sent to the Jun family's
second branch,

624
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,270
but the messenger,

625
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,070
too lazy to go to their place,

626
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,750
gave it to me instead.

627
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,440
I happened to read this letter,

628
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,890
and only then did I realize

629
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,640
what the second branch had been up to.

630
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,350
What...

631
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,400
"Mr. Chengsong,

632
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,000
Yannan, Beixuan, and Xixiang

633
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,510
are setting up a trading post
in the Uncontrollable,

634
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,030
which threatens our business.

635
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,960
Mr. Chengsong, please do us a favor.

636
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,240
If you don't want

637
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,440
the murder-for-hire plot
against Jun Chengliu

638
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
and Jun Feifan to get out,

639
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,030
send 5,000 taels of silver

640
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,160
to Tiger Stockade."

641
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,190
I...

642
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,790
My father has been kind to you.

643
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,310
Why did you hire assassins
to kill him and Jun Feifan?

644
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,360
Father, they're responsible
for your broken legs.

645
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,590
They even tried to kill Qiluo.

646
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,440
This... This letter...

647
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,110
This letter must be forged by them!

648
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,510
It must be forged by them

649
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,000
to slander me!

650
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,710
It's slander.

651
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,630
But it's all
written down clearly.

652
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,630
I knew they wouldn't admit it.

653
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,400
I've brought the messenger here.

654
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,880
Everything Ms. Qiluo said is true.

655
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,920
Today, there was a letter

656
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,070
from the Uncontrollable
to Mr. Chengsong.

657
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,230
You can even forge letters.

658
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,960
Of course, you forged the messenger too.

659
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,110
They forged it!

660
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,030
Absolutely!

661
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,840
It's fine if you don't admit it,

662
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,440
but I've sent someone
with 10,000 taels of silver

663
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,070
to Tiger Stockade mentioned in the letter.

664
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,360
Do you think those bandits

665
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,150
will spill everything

666
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,880
when they see the silver?

667
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,920
No, I... I...

668
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,720
Qiluo.

669
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,280
Qiluo,

670
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,280
it was all my idea.

671
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
He's not involved.

672
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,920
How can we do business with them?

673
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
Qiluo,

674
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
I'm begging you.

675
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,670
Spare your cousin.

676
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,710
It was me. I ordered the bandits

677
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,800
to kill Jun Feifan and Chengliu.

678
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,280
If Jun Feifan and Chengliu
die unexpectedly,

679
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,230
the Jun family's business would be mine.

680
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,190
Yujue knew nothing about this.

681
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,160
Qiluo,

682
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,400
please,

683
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,670
let Yujue go.

684
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,950
Qiluo...

685
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,030
Qiluo!

686
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,510
Yujue is still young.

687
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,030
He hasn't even married yet.

688
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,760
Please, let Yujue go.

689
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,600
Qiluo.

690
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,000
Qiluo!

691
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,160
Uncle,

692
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,590
whether he's involved or not,

693
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,360
the government will decide.

694
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,200
Move aside!

695
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,190
They're here. Let's move.

696
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,680
Jun Chengsong,

697
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,630
Ms. Qiluo reported you and your son

698
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,860
for allegedly hiring assassins.

699
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,800
Take them away.

700
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,750
Qiluo,

701
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,230
spare your cousin!

702
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,230
You can have the Brocade Embroidery

703
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,470
and the seal.

704
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,840
Spare Yujue!

705
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,150
He's my only child!

706
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,440
The Jun family only has one male heir!

707
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,480
Qiluo!

708
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Jun Qiluo!

709
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,600
Qiluo!

710
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,640
Young Master!

711
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,600
Bro...

712
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
Bro,

713
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,800
a gentleman uses words, not fists...

714
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,070
- Great!
- Serves him right.

715
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,800
Jun Qiluo, I'll get back on you!

716
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,710
Just you wait!

717
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,000
Ms. Qiluo,

718
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,880
when will the order be delivered?

719
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah, what should we do?

720
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,840
Don't worry,

721
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,280
I will handle

722
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,590
the delivery tomorrow.

723
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,280
The Jun family business
won't have any problems.

724
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,470
Everyone, go home.

725
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,590
Great. Thank you, Ms. Qiluo.

726
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,800
Thank you, Ms. Qiluo.

727
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,190
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

728
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,670
They'll deliver on time.

729
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,840
Now we can rest easy.

730
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,000
You did a great job today.

731
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,590
That was an excellent show.

732
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,880
Do you know how dangerous it was?

733
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,110
Why did you come out?

734
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,960
If I didn't, you'd be hurt.

735
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,070
That's not a big deal.

736
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,550
But if you were discovered,

737
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,880
you'd be risking your life.

738
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,550
Alright, alright.

739
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,670
Luo Qi is watching us.

740
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,550
Father, Xiukun,

741
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,400
don't you feel that

742
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,960
Qiluo is different now?

743
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,480
What's different?

744
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
She used to fully focus on the business,

745
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,480
calm and wise.

746
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,960
Now she's showing a softer side.

747
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,030
She's smiling more often.

748
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,280
Xuan Lie would rather risk
revealing his identity

749
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,230
to save her.

750
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,840
It seems that

751
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,670
Xuan Lie as my brother-in-law
wouldn't be so bad.

752
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,150
I'm getting better at making these kites.

753
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,590
If she sees this,
she'll definitely praise me.

754
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,620
(Consort Li passed away.)

755
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,230
Dongyin, what's going on?

756
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,630
Is there something wrong?

757
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,390
My Lord,

758
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,480
Consort Li...

759
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,630
She passed away.

760
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,950
No way.

761
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,280
It...

762
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,670
It can't be true.

763
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,550
Xuan Xu promised me

764
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,710
that Consort Li would stay alive

765
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,150
if I handed over the Luo Clan Seal.

766
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,800
How can this be true?

767
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
Impossible.

I told you she's fine

776
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,000
to put your mind at ease,

777
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,620

she's been ill for a long time.

that we'd return to Xixiang,

783
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,480
ride horses.

784
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,800
I'd play music for her,

785
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,110

I'll be grounded again.

802
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,000
I'll find a chance to see you.

803
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,360
I'll go after you go inside.

804
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,760
Just go.

805
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,510
Yunyi,

806
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,280
(Late Wife, Liu Yunyi, R.I.P.)
Qiluo has fallen in love.

807
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:06,070
I always hope she can
resume her female identity,

808
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,670
free from all her duties,

809
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,360
get married and start a family.

810
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,190
And it seems like
my wish is coming true.

811
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,340
(Blessing for Generations)

812
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,590
But who would have thought

813
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,110
the one she loves

814
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,670
is the Wolf Lord of Beixuan.

815
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,320
Mr. Jun.

816
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,550
How dare you come here!

817
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,600
Mr. Jun,

818
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I can't live without her.

819
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,360
I hope you'll bless us.

820
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,780
I think what you can't live without

821
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,030
is her being Baigong's heir!

822
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,070
She has been
designing weapons for Yannan.

823
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,320
All states are secretly searching for her.

824
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,320
You kidnapped her
from the Uncontrollable

825
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,000
for this reason, didn't you?

826
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,680
I admit that I kidnapped Qiluo

827
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,670
because I suspected
she was Baigong's heir.

828
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,230
But after spending time with her,

829
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,800
and going through life and death,

830
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,360
she is no longer

831
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,360
Jun Feifan in my heart,

832
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,590
but the person I love.

833
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,680
She's Jun Qiluo.

834
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,280
You are the Wolf Lord
of Beixuan, a Clan Leader.

835
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,150
If your King asks you to sacrifice Qiluo

836
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,920
for Beixuan's sake,

837
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,230
what will you do?

838
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,350
Mr. Jun,

839
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,280
I will step down as the Wolf Lord

840
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,150
to spend the rest of my life with Qiluo.

841
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,190
I won't let what you're worried about happen.

842
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,670
Even if they do,

843
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,110
I will protect her
with everything I have.

844
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,360
Your words sound beautiful,

845
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,190
proclaiming your love for her,

846
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,710
but from what I know,

847
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,000
she has suffered greatly in Beixuan.

848
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,430
You drove her to despair

849
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,630
and made her jump off a cliff, right?

850
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,800
Back then,

851
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,110
I asked for too much

852
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,280
and didn't protect her well.

853
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,480
All of this is my fault.

854
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,270
Mr. Jun, I know it's customary in Yannan

855
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,550
to seek forgiveness after punishment.

856
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,000
All that happened

857
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,510
was my fault.

858
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,190
Mr. Jun, I'm willing to
accept any punishment.

859
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,280
But please

860
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,710
give me another chance.

861
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,920
You're willing to accept punishment.

862
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,760
