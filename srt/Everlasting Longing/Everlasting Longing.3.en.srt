The longer I spend with you,
the more I find you

18
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,110
a fascinating person.

19
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,220
It's hard to let go.

20
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,110
Too bad I belong to someone else.

21
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,580
I don't interfere with others' women.

22
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,830
But a widow is fine.

23
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,270
Come on, over here.

24
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,230
Have a seat.

25
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,540
Drink up.

26
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,580
Manager.

27
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,420
Sir?

28
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,990
Prepare a room for that gentleman.

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,110
Also, bring some medicine to Room No. 1.

30
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,950
Sure.

31
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,190
Hey,

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,170
would you mind sharing a table?

33
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,180
I'm a Qi from Xuan Clan.

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,420
I'm about to go trade in Yannan.

35
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,070
May I ask who you are?

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,630
What a coincidence.

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,580
I'm He Sang, chief of the He caravan.

38
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,070
We're also from Xuan.

39
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,900
You two looked familiar,

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,300
so I took the liberty to chat.

41
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,990
I didn't expect
that we're all from Xuan.

42
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,510
No need to stand on ceremony.

43
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,350
Waiter,

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,460
bring a set of tableware.

45
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,510
When traveling,
we should help each other.

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,260
Especially since we are all
from Xuan.

47
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,180
But with your build,

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,760
you don't look like the Beixuan people.

49
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,460
Why are you alone?

50
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,500
Where are your companions?

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,950
My small build often invites trouble.

52
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,990
When we passed
through the Uncontrollable Canyon,

53
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,950
bandits attacked and robbed us.

54
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,300
If my companions hadn't
risked their lives to save me,

55
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,680
I wouldn't have made it to today.

56
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,620
Though Yao City

57
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,300
is located in the Uncontrollable,

58
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,270
it's close to Beixuan's Liangzhou.

59
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,030
There are many people from Beixuan.

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,180
The Xuan Leader is Beixuan's Protector.

61
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,620
He won't stand to see
his people being bullied.

62
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,270
Besides, you're one of us from Xuan.

63
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,140
How could I face the clan now?

64
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,950
I still want to go to Yannan,

65
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,110
at least to pay
for my brothers' funeral.

66
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,830
I think

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,110
it's better for you
to return to Xuan first.

68
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,110
By the way, where are your documents?

69
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,190
Documents?

70
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,990
Those bandits

71
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,700
took everything from me.

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,230
My identity papers are long gone.

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,860
Then you're in trouble.

74
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,400
Without your identity papers,
you can't even leave here.

75
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,140
To pass through Beixuan passes,

76
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,420
you need identity papers

77
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,550
with the Leader's seal.

78
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,380
Is there no other way?

79
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,230
Unless...

80
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,590
But that's impossible.

81
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,480
Unless you have the Leader's
handwritten order.

82
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,910
That's too difficult.

83
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,750
Simply impossible.

84
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,990
General, let me help you.

85
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,630
Thank you.

86
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,060
How are your injuries?

87
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,740
Thank you for your concern.

88
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,380
They're almost healed.

89
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,500
In that case,

90
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,260
we should settle the debts

91
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,150
between us in the desert.

92
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,910
It's about time.

93
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,300
I bandaged your wounds,

94
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,740
helped you out of the desert,

95
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,990
saved your life from a wolf pack,

96
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,110
and now I'm still cleaning your wounds.

97
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,380
How do you plan to repay me?

98
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,590
You trapped me in the quicksand.

99
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,740
How should you pay for this?

100
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,670
But I also saved your life
from the quicksand.

101
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,550
Then you pushed me
into the Death Desert.

102
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,550
If I could control the storm,

103
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,620
your army would've been destroyed

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,300
in the battle
at the Uncontrollable Canyon.

105
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,910
Do you talk to your young master
like this?

106
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,550
You're about to become the Wolf Lord
of the Five Clans.

107
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,010
You certainly wouldn't mind.

108
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,910
You're quite concerned about this.

109
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,470
You may not know this.

110
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,230
During my meal,

111
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,350
I noticed that the people
near the Uncontrollable

112
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,500
are all betting on this.

113
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,710
I also placed a big bet on you.

114
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,060
I wagered all the money

115
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,420
I brought on you.

116
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,710
Don't make me lose it.

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,060
So, you think I will win.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,420
You're renowned throughout the world,

119
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,250
and you're kind and compassionate.

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,180
Of course, I hope you win.

121
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,840
As expected of someone
raised by merchants.

122
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Your attitude shifts so quickly.

123
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,030
Thank you for the compliment.

124
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,350
Alright, the wound is bandaged.

125
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,940
Please enjoy your meal.

126
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,030
I'll leave now.

127
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,580
Young Master,

128
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,590
I've found out

129
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,450
that Xuan Lie is staying
at Guangxuan Inn.

130
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,620
How many people are with him?

131
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,190
Only He Jiyao

132
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,060
(Xi Lin, Xi's Deputy General)
and a young man.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,160
I've never seen him before.

134
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Xuan Lie never
brings strangers with him.

135
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,550
This person must be
very important to him.

136
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,740
It doesn't matter.

137
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,210
When it's past the Zi hour,

138
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,030
they will have only souls left.

139
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,990
Xuan Lie being alone
is a great opportunity.

140
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,570
Make sure to kill him this time.

141
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,230
He cannot leave Yao City alive.

142
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,150
Luo Qi and Xuanyu Army
are not far from here.

143
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,400
They'll surely come to his aid.

144
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,840
Send someone to hold them off,

145
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,470
so they won't ruin our plan.

146
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,580
Understood.

147
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,830
Deputy Luo,

148
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,260
last night, he came to kill
those smuggling weapons.

149
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,790
Realizing it was a trap,

150
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,160
he poisoned himself to death.

151
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,060
A trained Death Warrior.

152
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,360
Without the young master here,

153
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,400
how should we handle this?

154
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,550
Have someone draw the tattoo first.

155
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,220
Deputy Luo,

156
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,590
Deputy He sent a message.

157
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,180
(Lead the army to Yao City at once.)

158
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,810
It seems He Jiyao
found the young master.

159
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,860
Order everyone

160
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,150
to pack up immediately.

161
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,620
We are heading to Yao City.

162
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,380
Needlework!

163
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,670
Fine needlework!

164
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,600
Sir, would you like to look
at some needlework?

165
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,790
It's not as exquisite
as those from Yannan,

166
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,230
but it has its own charm.

167
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,590
Do you like them?

168
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,710
Even if I do, I can only look at it.

169
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,180
I'm penniless now.

170
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,780
I can buy it for you.

171
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,740
Young Master,

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,090
something's off
with the merchant across.

173
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,190
They might be from Xi.

174
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,460
I know.

175
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,900
Don't raise the alarm yet.

176
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,220
Where is he?

177
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,150
Find him.

178
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,500
Needlework!

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,140
(Various Raw Stones)

180
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Sir, feel free to look
at anything you need.

181
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,900
I'd like to buy some raw stones.

182
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,780
These are the best raw stones
from the Uncontrollable.

183
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,070
Take your time, sir.

184
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,230
Since you have this fragrant jade,

185
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,740
you can choose anything from my stall.

186
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,590
Ma'am, you're not being honest.

187
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,540
I only want the best raw stones.

188
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,860
Don't try to fool me
with inferior goods.

189
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,110
These are all raw stones
from Mount Guan,

190
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,020
with very high purity.

191
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,260
They can be used for jewelry or tools.

192
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,840
You can only find them in Yao City.

193
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,470
The hardness is off.

194
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,110
Is this all the stock you have?

195
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,140
Yao City is close to Liangzhou,

196
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,230
rich in minerals.

197
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,710
You can get as many as you want.

198
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,470
If what's on the shelf isn't enough,

199
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,590
you can place an order with a deposit.

200
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,470
If I give you more fragrant jade,

201
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,190
could you take me to see those mines?

202
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,500
The mines of Yao City are in Beixuan.

203
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,260
They're controlled
by the Beixuan people

204
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,710
and heavily guarded.

205
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,140
We only dare to pick up some rubble
around the outskirts.

206
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,460
Ma'am,

207
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,260
do you have any stones
harder than these?

208
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,900
The hardest stones

209
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,590
are black iron crystals.

210
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,540
Seeing that you're an expert,

211
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,070
I'll tell you the truth.

212
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,620
The black iron crystal mines
are said to be in Beixuan,

213
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,140
but they haven't been seen
in hundreds of years.

214
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,260
They're impossible to get.

215
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,830
Sir,

216
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,740
you'd better not waste your effort.

217
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,030
Thank you.

218
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,830
- Chase!
- Young Master,

219
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,140
it's the Xi scout from earlier.

220
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,190
Step aside.

221
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,860
Acting guilty, huh?

222
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,620
Tell me.

223
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,310
Where did you take him?

224
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

225
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,620
Acting tough, huh?

226
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,470
Xi Changkun sent you, didn't he?

227
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,110
It was Mr. Xi Mo.

228
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,780
Tell me. Where did you take him?

229
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,740
General.

230
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,100
Where have you gone?

231
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,260
I turned around and couldn't see you,

232
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,510
so I've been searching for you.

233
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,310
It's okay. Let's head back.

234
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,500
Stay close.

235
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,070
Young Master,

236
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,900
the interception failed.
Luo Qi broke through

237
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,160
and is now heading to Yao City.

238
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,110
Act tonight.

239
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,350
As long as they can't reach
Yao City tonight,

240
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,540
it won't be a failure.

241
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,950
Understood.

242
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,430
Don't approach me from behind again.

243
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,740
When I saw you in the street,

244
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,500
I noticed the injury on your back,

245
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,310
so I asked the manager for some medicine

246
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,660
to help you with it.

247
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,780
Though you're dressed as a man,

248
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,710
you're still a young lady.

249
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,900
In some occasions, discretion is needed.

250
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,190
I only meant well.

251
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,500
The young master often reminds me

252
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,950
not to be so particular.

253
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,660
If you feel uncomfortable,

254
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,990
I'll take my leave.

255
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,710
I'll leave the medicine here.

256
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,100
(Heavenly Room No. 2)

257
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,860
Miss Qi Luo, since when did you

258
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,500
become a thief?

259
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,310
I was just curious

260
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,830
about why you put the inn's signboard

261
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,740
in the room.

262
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,740
I only took it out
and hung it up for you.

263
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,350
In that case,

264
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,590
I've wronged you.

265
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,430
It's alright.

266
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,700
Young Master, we spotted a large group
of disguised soldiers outside the city.

267
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,590
It looks like Xi Changkun
is making a move.

268
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,310
Xi Mo should've surrounded
Yao City by now.

269
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,780
We can't get out.

270
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,230
What should we do?

271
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,240
Luo Qi is still on his way.

272
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,660
With just a few of us,

273
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,020
we can't match their strength.

274
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,260
I have a plan for this.

275
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,150
Just try your best to protect Qi Luo.

276
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,420
(Yao City)

277
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,470
The bandits are here!

278
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,070
Don't panic, everyone.

279
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,860
Just give them the money
and it will be fine.

280
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,790
Follow me.

281
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,140
Hurry, hurry!

282
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,230
Hurry, hurry, keep up!

283
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,070
Keep up!

284
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,500
- They're here!
- This way.

285
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,420
(Guangxuan Inn)

286
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,500
Hurry!

287
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,430
Don't move!

288
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,830
Don't move!

289
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,260
They're coming for you?

290
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,100
Help me out.

291
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,950
This is another deal.

292
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,900
What do you have for me?

293
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,990
Working with me won't make you lose.

294
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,120
No one can make me lose
if I'm working with them.

295
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,960
As long as it doesn't harm Beixuan,

296
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,030
choose whatever you want.

297
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,860
Alright.

298
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,990
All the men, squat down.

299
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,500
The women, go outside.

300
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,460
Hurry up!

301
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,740
- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

302
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,110
- Hurry!
- Quickly!

303
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,190
- Hurry!
- Hurry up!

304
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,780
You guys go upstairs and take a look.

305
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,950
- Yes.
- Yes.

306
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,770
Young Master,

307
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,900
the front and back doors of the inn
are surrounded.

308
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
The four city gates have been guarded.

309
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,620
Xuan Lie has no way to escape.

310
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,050
What about Luo Zhizhou, Luo Leader,

311
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,300
who is close to Xuan Lie?

312
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,050
Have you guarded
his old house in Yao City?

313
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,580
Luo Zhizhou is in the Royal City now,

314
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,710
and his old house is empty.

315
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,230
We can't neglect there.

316
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,840
Send someone to watch over it.

317
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,190
Xuan Lie ruined our weapon trade
in the Uncontrollable.

318
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,660
This time, he must die
without redemption.

319
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,990
Once Xuan Lie is dead,

320
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,350
no one will dare to touch the case
from 12 years ago.

321
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,540
Father will surely praise me.

322
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,350
Let's go take a look.

323
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,140
So, you're Xuan Lie.

324
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,620
Guys, attack!

325
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,830
Young Master.

326
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,020
(Take this token and go)

327
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,560
(to the Luos' old house in Willow Alley
to find Luo Zhizhou.)

328
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,630
(He grew up with me.)

329
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,940
(He'll surely come to save me.)

330
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,800
(I'll hold them off
and buy you some time.)

331
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,700
(Luo Residence)

332
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,260
(Changqing Tower)

333
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,140
(Xuan)

334
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,580
Aren't you afraid I'll run away
with the token?

335
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,060
In the desert, you swore
you wouldn't abandon me.

336
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,100
Even if you wanted to escape,

337
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,810
you saved me as you promised.

338
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,430
I trust you, and I'm willing
to take the risk.

339
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,380
Of course,

340
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,540
if I've misjudged you,

341
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,430
and you want to avenge your caravan,

342
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,780
I have nothing to say.

343
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,500
(Should I save him or not?)

344
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,300
(Fine, let fate decide.)

345
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,550
If it's an even number, I'll go.

346
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
If not, I won't go.

347
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,950
One, two, three, four.

348
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,230
This way, hurry!

349
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,270
This way!

350
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,230
Young Master, what should we do now?

351
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,730
I've sent Qi Luo to find Zhizhou.

352
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,900
His troop will be here soon.

353
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,310
Isn't Mr. Luo in the Royal City?

354
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
During these days every year,

355
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,390
he secretly comes
to pay respects to his mother.

356
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,710
But Miss Qi Luo is from Yannan.

357
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,150
What if she leaves with the token?

358
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,430
(Luo Residence)
Is there anyone?

359
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,260
Please give me some food.

360
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,500
It's nothing, just a beggar.

361
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,830
He Jiyao.

362
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,860
He Jiyao.

363
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,270
Hang on.

364
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,100
(Luo Residence)

365
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,670
Is there anyone?

366
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,150
Who's outside?

367
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,820
Please, help me out.

368
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,230
I haven't eaten in days.

369
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,780
(Xuan)

370
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,580
(Luo Zhizhou, Luo Leader, Beixuan)

371
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,820
(Xuan)

372
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,830
Set the fire.

373
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,620
Young Master,

374
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,020
Xuan Lie is already a fish in the net.

375
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,870
Qi Luo and Mr. Luo
might not come in time.

376
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,230
Young Master, are we...

377
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,070
Don't worry.

378
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,540
I won't let you die so young.

379
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,990
Luo Zhizhou.

380
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,030
How did he get here?

381
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,020
Everyone, go up and support.

382
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,070
Xuan Lie!

384
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,710
Xuan Lie! Xuan Lie!

385
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,990
Kill them!

386
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,620
I have an idea.

387
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,470
Why is there a woman here?

388
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,020
She's the one who went
to inform Luo Zhizhou?

389
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,180
Yes.

390
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,870
Doesn't Xuan Lie only have He Jiyao

391
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,190
and that Yannan boy with him?

392
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,300
When did a woman appear?

393
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,660
Oh, no. She's going to ring the bell
and alert everyone.

394
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,900
It's on fire!

395
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,910
Go put out the fire!

396
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,430
It's on fire! Go put it out!

397
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,310
Young Master,

398
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,150
the commoners are out
to help with the fire.

399
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,260
Should we kill a few of them

400
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
to scare them back?

401
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,670
We're disguised as bandits

402
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,230
to distance Xuan Lie's death

403
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,670
from our Xi Clan.

404
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,740
Kill commoners?

405
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,670
Do you want to make things worse?

406
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,670
Young Master, how considerate of you.

407
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,780
I'll head to Liangzhou
to meet with Father first.

408
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,300
You investigate her background.

409
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,510
Yes.

410
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,100
Lie!

411
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,030
Retreat!

412
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,860
Lie!

413
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,580
Xuan Lie.

414
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,230
Xuan Lie.

415
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Lift them out first!

416
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,300
Don't touch my friend!

417
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,670
You little brat, move aside!

418
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,900
Move aside!

419
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,140
Stop!

420
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:56,990
Don't be afraid.

421
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,230
Is that your friend?

422
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,990
I'll help you bury him.

423
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,460
This is my first time forging a sword.

424
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,820
It's also my second work.

425
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,300
This sword is very sharp
and cuts through iron like mud.

426
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,240
I want you to have it.

427
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,430
Young Master, this...

428
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,470
Once you accept my sword,
you work for me now.

429
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,470
Remember that.

430
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,510
What are you doing?

431
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,870
What are you planning to do?
Running away, huh?

432
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,230
Go ahead, run.

433
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,710
Run then.

434
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,440
If you don't want to die,
behave yourself.

435
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,740
We gave him half a bottle
of softening potion.

436
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,730
I didn't expect him
to recover so quickly.

437
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,260
This kid's a tough one.

438
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,740
Is it okay for us to sell him like this?

439
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,300
This is the Uncontrollable, after all.

440
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,300
No one reports or investigates.

441
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,740
His past doesn't matter.

442
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,150
Besides, he's from Yannan.

443
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,030
Let me tell you.

444
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,020
This morning, Ms. Tan from the stockade
came to inspect the goods.

445
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,540
She gave this price.

446
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,060
You'd better stay alert tonight.

447
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,670
Double the amount of drug.

448
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,150
Tomorrow, nothing can go wrong.

449
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,380
(Border Stockade)

450
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,060
Miss, do you want to buy water?

451
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,150
(Water)
One qian per bowl.

452
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,990
One qian per bowl.

453
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,580
Miss.

454
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,780
Everyone,

455
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,100
come and take a look!

456
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,230
We have fresh stock today!

457
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,190
All top-quality goods!

458
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,060
Starting price only ten wen.

459
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,500
Highest bid wins!

460
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,670
Highest bid wins!

461
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,030
Come here!

462
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,240
What do you think?

463
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,150
You can take him away
if you can afford him.

464
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,990
I bid ten qian.

465
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,710
15.

466
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,710
I bid 20.

467
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,390
Any higher than 20?

468
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,820
- Anyone?
- I bid 25.

469
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,260
25 once.

470
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,670
25 twice.

471
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,300
- 25...
- 50.

472
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,580
For this girl?

473
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,300
I want him.

474
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,550
Go away.

475
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,750
Come here.

476
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,020
That's more like it.

477
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,230
I bid 300.

478
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,580
- 350.
- 400.

479
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,580
- 450.
- 500.

480
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,060
500 once.

481
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,510
500...

482
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,060
Go away. Go away.

483
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,340
Stop causing trouble here.

484
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,870
How can you buy a man with only 50?

485
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,020
500 twice.

486
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,910
- 500...
- I'm talking about gold.

487
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,430
Gold.

488
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,190
This...

489
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,020
How generous of her.

490
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,910
Gold once, twice, three times.

491
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,750
Sold!

492
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,900
Take him away.

493
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,920
Where did this girl come from?

494
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,820
How dare you compete with me?

495
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,870
Do you want to buy him

496
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,260
because he's good-looking too?

497
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,500
So what if it is?

498
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,630
50 gold.

499
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,060
He's already been disfigured.

500
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,170
Do you still want him?

501
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,670
- You...
- What?

502
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,510
Let's go.

503
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,820
Staying by my side

504
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,690
is much better
than being humiliated here.

505
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,830
Don't worry.

506
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,020
I'm not a bad person.

507
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,780
Your eyes are so beautiful.

508
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,020
I'll treat you very well.

509
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,230
Does it hurt?

510
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,910
Why don't you cry out?

511
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,190
Miss, he's shy and fierce.

512
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,340
He needs proper training.

513
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,390
You're fierce and won't cry out, huh?

514
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,430
I thought my whip technique
had deteriorated

515
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,910
and failed Lie's teachings.

516
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,740
(Luo Residence)

517
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,870
There are no survivors.

518
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,150
Xi Clan withdrew their troops
too cleanly this time.

519
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,950
They must have been prepared.

520
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,670
Xi Changkun is no fool.

521
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,120
You came to Yao City
only to pay respects,

522
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,400
so you didn't bring much force.

523
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,710
I didn't expect to catch anything
on Xi Clan.

524
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,060
It was already a pleasant surprise
that Qi Luo came back to rescue me.

525
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,910
You're talking about Miss Qi Luo, right?

526
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,340
She truly is a remarkable woman.

527
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,990
She made do
with what was around her, drew a bow,

528
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,060
and shot down dozens
of Xi Clan archers.

529
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,100
And she even thought of ringing the bell

530
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,020
to force Xi Mo to retreat.

531
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,710
It's a pity she's a woman.

532
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,020
If she were a man,
she'd be a pillar of society.

533
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,820
Her talents far exceed many men's.

534
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,320
This is the first time I've seen you

535
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,580
praise a woman like this.

536
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,430
I just think she's different
from other women.

537
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,540
She's smart, tough,

538
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,190
harsh on others,

539
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,870
but even harsher on herself.

540
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,100
She's cunning and wise,

541
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,430
like both foxes and wolves,

542
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,990
making people curious about her.

543
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,750
Lie,

544
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,440
something's off with you.

545
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,870
Anyway, I've asked the wet nurse

546
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,340
to take care of your fox.

547
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,190
You rest for now.

548
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,260
Later, I'll bring her to see you.

549
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,780
Miss, you're ready?

550
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,430
Please sit down and have some snacks.

551
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,270
Sure.

552
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,140
Sit.

553
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,870
You look great.

554
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,150
Miss, you may not know this,

555
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,220
but our young master has never
been close to any young lady.

556
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,830
Let alone bring a young lady
to this old house.

557
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,540
Besides us old women,

558
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
- there isn't any young lady here.
- Thank you.

559
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,350
That just shows how much

560
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,660
the young master values you.

561
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,800
The last time I saw you,
I really thought you were a young man.

562
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,910
I didn't expect you to be

563
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,660
such a beautiful young lady.

564
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,870
- I...
- Stop teasing her.

565
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,150
Miss,

566
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,060
my young master is eight chi tall,

567
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,390
extremely handsome,

568
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,580
skilled in both literary
and martial arts,

569
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,350
and has great wealth

570
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,950
and lands and houses aplenty.

571
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,430
What's more, he has no elderly parents,

572
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,220
and no concubines or illegitimate kids.

573
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,870
When you're here,

574
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,950
there's no need to worry

575
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,310
about complicated relationships
with sisters-in-law.

576
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,830
I won't hide it from you, Miss.

577
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,020
Our young master is still

578
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,220
a virgin at his age.

579
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,990
Such a good man is hard to find.

580
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,750
I think you and her young master

581
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,220
would make a perfect match.

582
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,500
Who is your young master?

583
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,550
What are you talking about?

584
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,430
Young Master, you're back.

585
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,700
Mr. Luo really cares
for this young lady.

586
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,540
Ms. Zhang,

587
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,750
it seems good things
are near for your family.

588
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,500
Let's go now.

589
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,660
You stay with the young lady.

590
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,150
Young Master,

591
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,450
I think this young lady
is a good match for you.

592
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,060
She'll surely bear us
a younger master one day.

593
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,660
You must seize the opportunity.

594
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,430
She's Lie's honored guest.

595
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,580
Nanny, don't say such things.

596
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,710
Let's go.

597
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,890
My wet nurse's been living here
for a long time

598
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,630
with sharp eyes.

599
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,300
She's seen many travelers
from everywhere.

600
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,150
Miss Qi,

601
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,370
do you still wish to pretend
to be a man before them?

602
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,010
Being in a foreign land
and traveling the world,

603
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,020
it's more convenient
to present myself as a man

604
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,220
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

605
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,020
I'm here on someone's request
to check on you.

606
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,320
Since you haven't settled in yet,

607
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,890
I'll leave you to it for now.

608
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,570
Has the general woken up?

609
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,620
He's awake, but he fell back asleep.

610
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,420
Don't worry.

611
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,870
Once you've all rested,

612
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,210
I'll take you to see him.

613
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,670
Alright.

614
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,060
Are you seeking a reward?

615
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,570
You don't need to worry.

616
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,100
Lie is generous with rewards.

617
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,230
No.

618
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,750
Mr. Luo,

619
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,830
could you prepare men's clothes for me?

620
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,430
Alright, I'll arrange that right away.

621
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,320
(My brother, by order of the King,)

622
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,310
(is in charge of exploration
within Beixuan.)

623
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,530
A few days ago, I received his letter,

624
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,910
saying they discovered a new mine.

625
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,790
It's called black...

626
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,390
Black iron crystal.

627
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,390
Yes, black iron crystal.

628
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,790
My brother said they needed people

629
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,910
to oversee the exploration.

630
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,590
Where is the mine located?

631
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,120
My brother is always secretive

632
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,280
about the exploration.

633
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,470
If you want to know the truth,

634
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,310
I can write a letter home and ask.

635
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,910
(Xuan Lie and his deputy's
conversation these days)

636
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,910
(shouldn't be false.)

637
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,470
(The black iron crystal mine
has appeared in Beixuan.)

638
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,660
(Without pass documents,)

639
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,430
(I can only rely on Xuan Lie
to enter Beixuan now.)
