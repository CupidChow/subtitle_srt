17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,320
Young Master,

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,710
Miss Jun left with Shao Qimin.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,350
Explain to her later.

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,040
The Sacrifice Ritual just ended.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
I'm worried that Zhizhou...

22
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,180
(May we be brothers in the next life.)

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,590
Lie,

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
may we be brothers in the next life.

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,800
Zhizhou.

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,000
When did you get that scar?

27
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,870
I never noticed it before.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,910
It's an old wound.

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
That's good.

30
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,360
Now I won't mistake you for someone else.

31
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,080
You betrayed me,

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,190
tried to kill me many times,

33
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,000
and caused Mr. Sun's death.

34
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,910
Even in the next life,

35
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,150
I won't be your brother again.

36
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,590
He Jiyao, Luo Qi,

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,280
burn his body.

38
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,560
Even if he's dead,

39
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,560
don't let him remain whole.

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Hurry up.

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,870
Jun Qiluo.

42
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,560
We're here to capture
Baigong's heir, Jun Qiluo.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,030
I dare you.

44
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
Qimin,

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,030
they got the numbers.

46
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,360
I'll go with them first.

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
My Lady,

48
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,360
the King of Beixuan knows your identity.

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,630
He won't let you go easily.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,400
I'll figure something out.

51
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,990
I'll go with you.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,860
My Lady.

53
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,260
(Xuan Mansion)

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
General.

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Young Master,

56
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,750
we handled Mr. Luo's remains

57
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,560
as you instructed.

58
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,160
Pay attention to Xixiang.

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,950
Report immediately

60
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,160
if you notice something.

61
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
- Yes.
- Young Master,

62
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,430
why focus on Xixiang suddenly?

63
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,630
If he's not going to Xixiang,

64
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,750
where else could he go?

65
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,480
- What?
- Xuan Lie!

66
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,040
She's been taken by the guards.

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,950
Did you reveal her identity?

68
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,720
You've broken her heart.

69
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,070
Do you want her dead?

70
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,830
When did that happen?

71
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,240
If anything happens to her,

72
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,600
I won't go easy on you.

73
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,700
(Xuanwu Palace)

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,800
General Lie, you cannot enter.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,120
Your Majesty, where is Qiluo?

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,560
For that Yannan woman's sake,

77
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,430
you're getting more disrespectful.

78
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,910
Please

79
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,470
release her.

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,310
I told you to make her
reveal the Baigong Crafts.

81
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
Not only did you fail,
but she nearly escaped.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,560
How do you explain this?

83
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,480
I know you care deeply for her,

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
but don't forget that

85
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,120
to merge the military powers,

86
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,040
my late father, General Xuan Shu,

87
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,190
you, and I all made great sacrifices.

88
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,390
Now the military powers are merged,

89
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,720
the next step is to attack Yannan.

90
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,680
If we let her return to Yannan now,

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,240
she will continue
crafting weapons for their king.

92
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,040
Do you know the consequences?

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
We don't have to attack Yannan

94
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,920
to ensure our prosperity.

95
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,950
Qiluo suggests opening trading posts

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
to boost trade.

97
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,120
She's gotten into your head.

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,830
How can a woman from Yannan

99
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,920
meddle in Beixuan's affairs?

100
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
Your Majesty,

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,190
let's discuss it later.

102
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,190
I promise she won't return to Yannan.

103
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,000
But if I can't take her today,

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,920
I will not leave.

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,830
Are you threatening me for her?

106
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,070
Have you forgotten?

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
She is the culprit in your father's death.

108
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
Qiluo has nothing to do with it.

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,560
I obey you in all things

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
but Qiluo.

111
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,510
I must ensure her safety.

112
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,240
Fine.

113
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,560
Since that's the case,

114
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
it's a good day to wed in three days.

115
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,430
If you marry Princess Sun Zhaomin,

116
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,360
I will agree to let you take her away.

117
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,890
Thank you, Your Majesty.

118
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,760
Qiluo.

119
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,480
Why bother to save me?

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Qiluo,

121
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,600
get some rest.

122
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,310
When did you know I'm Baigong's heir?

123
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,870
After the Hunting Event,

124
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,870
you acted unusually

125
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,750
upon seeing the arrow.

126
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,190
I resolved the Trade Token that day

127
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,480
and confirmed your identity.

128
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,720
You suspect Xi Changkun and I

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,190
conspired to kill your parents.

130
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,190
Why haven't you mentioned it?

131
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,480
Because I don't believe it.

132
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,310
You were too young

133
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
to have a motive to kill them.

134
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,950
Besides, all evidence points to you,

135
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,270
making it more suspicious.

136
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
It wasn't you, right?

137
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,870
Qiluo,

138
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,840
I will clear your name.

139
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,320
Please trust me.

140
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,440
Xi Changkun is dead.

141
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,870
How will you prove it?

142
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,030
What is your plan?

143
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,630
Force me to give up Baigong Crafts

144
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,720
to collaborate with Beixuan?

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,790
You know I won't.

146
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,080
Then let me go.

147
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,030
It's not me who stops you.

148
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,320
The King knows your identity.

149
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,750
If you leave, you'll face danger.

150
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,710
So what?

151
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,790
You're marrying

152
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,270
Princess Zhaomin anyway.

153
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,390
Xuan Lie,

154
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,150
it's over between us.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let me go.

156
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,910
If you give me more time,

157
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,840
I'm sure I'll find a perfect solution.

158
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,870
I will

159
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,510
handle the rest.

160
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Xuan Lie.

161
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,230
He Jiyao,

162
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,550
get someone to protect her.

163
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,540
(Trade Document)

164
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,630
Let them pass.

165
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,180
(Uphold Virtue)

166
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,230
Young Master.

167
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,790
We're surrounded by guards.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,030
The King fears you'll aid Jun's escape.

169
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,930
So, the Xuan Mansion is under surveillance.

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,600
It's also for the greater good.

171
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,390
If Miss Jun returns,

172
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,510
you won't be able to explain

173
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,720
to Beixuan's clans.

174
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,600
Send a message to Yannan's spies.

175
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,870
Let them spread the word in Yannan

176
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,670
that Baigong's heir's received
a large sum from Beixuan

177
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,130
and agreed to collaborate with them.

178
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,590
Young Master,

179
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,630
what's the aim here?

180
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,840
The King's sent news to Yannan

181
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,670
about Baigong's heir working with Beixuan.

182
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
The more exaggerated it is,

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
the more the suspicious King of Yannan

184
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
will believe it's a trap by Beixuan.

185
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,910
That's right.

186
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,150
As Yannan's premier establishment,

187
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,000
the Juns are wealthy.

188
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,240
They won't be swayed by money.

189
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,510
Our words will only

190
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,200
convince the King of Yannan

191
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,550
of Miss Jun's loyalty.

192
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,630
Tell the spies

193
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,150
if anyone harms the Jun family,

194
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,870
show no mercy.

195
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes.

196
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,860
(Prisoner)

197
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,120
What a feast.

198
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,630
Wine and meat.

199
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,030
Perhaps your execution is tomorrow.

200
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,240
Shut your mouth.

201
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,790
We're all on death row.

202
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,240
Today or tomorrow, same fate.

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,480
Why take it so seriously?

204
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,320
You...

205
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,630
Jiangjuan,

206
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,670
it'll be all right.

207
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,240
Brother will save us when he returns.

208
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,260
Father,

209
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,150
my brother is no traitor.

210
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,320
It's a misunderstanding.

211
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,480
Before entering the prison,

212
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,320
I asked Eunuch Ding
for my audience with the King.

213
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,550
Once I meet the King,

214
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,240
I'll ask him to investigate thoroughly.

215
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,750
All right. Let's eat.

216
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,750
Here, Father.

217
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,320
Father.

218
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,750
You're back.

219
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,710
Yes.

220
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,490
- Have you heard
- Stop!

221
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,600
- Beixuan Wolf Lord
- You brat, come back!

222
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,000
is going to marry Sun's Princess?

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,030
Didn't they say the Wolf Lord

224
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,000
already has a Yannan merchant woman?

225
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,080
I thought he was going to marry her.

226
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,240
That woman is just dreaming.

227
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,270
How could a Yannan woman

228
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,790
become the Wolf Lord's bride?

229
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,150
Look at her now,

230
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,270
she's been imprisoned by the Wolf Lord.

231
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,390
What happened to that Yannan woman?

232
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,390
She's been locked up.

233
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,440
It's spread all over Beixuan.

234
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,720
- Nonsense.
- What are you doing?

235
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
My Lord.

236
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,320
We must act with caution

237
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,480
and hide our identities.

238
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,910
Why were you so reckless?

239
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,920
My Lord,

240
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
General Lie is to wed Princess Zhaomin

241
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,360
and has imprisoned Miss Jun.

242
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,670
I'm worried about her safety.

243
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,080
Lie won't harm Miss Jun.

244
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,390
Don't worry.

245
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,030
But General Lie is domineering,

246
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,670
and Miss Jun is strong-willed.

247
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,110
My Lord,

248
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
I must go back to save her.

249
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You've just managed to escape.

250
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,720
If you return now,

251
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,270
you might be captured by Lie.

252
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,320
Is she worth the risk?

253
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,030
She respects and cares for me

254
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,750
and has saved me many times.

255
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,480
To me,

256
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,960
she's as important as you.

257
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,080
Lie is very meticulous

258
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,510
and he greatly values Miss Jun.

259
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,840
He will surely keep a strict watch.

260
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Even if you go, you may not succeed.

261
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,030
My Lord, don't forget

262
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,000
that it was Consort Li and I

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,510
who saved you from the Heavenly Prison.

264
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,720
Is Xuan Mansion

265
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,750
more heavily guarded
than the Heavenly Prison?

266
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:50,380
(Heavenly Prison)

267
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,660
(Heavenly Prison)

268
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,230
Your Ladyship,

269
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,440
Mr. Luo was kind to me.

270
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,750
That's why I agreed to help.

271
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,600
Hurry up. Time is short.

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
If we get caught,

273
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,510
I'll be doomed.

274
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,510
Thank you.

275
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,160
Zhizhou.

276
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,030
Why are you here?

277
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
To rescue you.

278
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,390
This is the Heavenly Prison.

279
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,080
It's not a place to come and go freely.

280
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,910
My Lord, rest assured.

281
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,440
We've got it all planned out.

282
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,670
This dying man will

283
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,840
replace you in the prison.

284
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,240
We found this dying man

285
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,870
and did a simple trick.

286
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,160
No.

287
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,840
If I leave,

288
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,320
this man will die for me.

289
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,240
And if it's discovered,

290
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,440
you'll be incriminated.

291
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,510
My Lord,

292
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,030
he's already gravely ill.

293
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
His time is running out.

294
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,360
Her Ladyship gave them a fortune

295
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,030
so they'll live without worries.

296
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,390
He volunteered.

297
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,120
He won't betray us.

298
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,440
Zhizhou,

299
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,870
you handed over the Luo Clan Seal,

300
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,910
but the King won't spare your life.

301
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,720
I've dragged you into this.

302
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,150
I can't sit back and watch you die.

303
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm willing to do this.

304
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
Zhizhou,

305
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,670
you must stay alive.

306
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,240
If I face trouble in the future,

307
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,870
you'll be the only one I have.

308
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,150
Be cautious

309
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,840
on this journey.

310
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,670
Return safely.

311
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,320
I will, My Lord.

312
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,980
(Moon Palace)

313
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,830
Anything from the Luo Clan?

314
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,400
The King sent envoys to calm them.

315
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,920
There won't be any more trouble.

316
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,830
From now on,

317
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,330
Yi and I have to rely on ourselves.

318
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,760
Mother,

319
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,680
I'm hungry.

320
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,430
Really?

321
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,270
Let me make you sweet pancakes.

322
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,200
I haven't had them for a long while.

323
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,480
An Imperial Edict.

324
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,830
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

325
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,480
The King has decreed an order.

326
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,790
The Forbidden Troops will
escort Prince Yi to the frontier.

327
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,110
Why is that?

328
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,240
Is he going alone?

329
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,110
The frontier is over 100 miles from here.

330
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,200
Yi has never left my side.

331
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,440
I won't allow it.

332
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,590
Mother.

333
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,590
I don't want to leave you.

334
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,550
No.

335
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,200
The King decrees:

336
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,750
Consort Li's conduct is improper,

337
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,640
and she is unfit for motherhood.

338
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,790
Thus, Yi will be adopted
by Duke Yu at the frontier.

339
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,630
Adopted?

340
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,440
Yi is the child

341
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,000
of the King and me.

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
In consideration of your years of service,

343
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,110
your life is spared.

344
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,440
You'll be confined to the Moon Palace

345
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
and may not leave.

346
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,000
- Take him away.
- Yes.

347
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
- No, Yi.
- Prince.

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,550
- Let me see the King.
- Mother.

349
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,390
Yi.

350
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,070
- Mother.
- You can't take him.

351
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,590
- Your Ladyship.
- Don't take him.

352
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,720
Mother.

353
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,830
Yi!

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,750
- Mother.
- Yi!

355
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,310
- Let me see the King.
- Go.

356
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,750
I can't live without him.

357
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,590
- Mother!
- Yi!

358
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,680
- Your Ladyship.
- Yi!

359
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,030
Mother.

360
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,440
Your Majesty,

361
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,550
he is your son too.

362
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,110
How can you be so heartless?

363
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,820
(Spirit Tablet of Sun Ba, Late Husband)

364
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,720
The King orders us to marry in three days

365
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,350
to dispel mourning.

366
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,010
Father has just passed away.

367
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,370
I've handed over the Tiger Tally.

368
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,510
If I refuse the marriage publicly,

369
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920
I'm afraid of angering the King

370
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,510
and bringing trouble to our clan.

371
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
But you know,

372
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,590
Qiluo and I are as close as sisters.

373
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,550
I am unwilling to marry you.

374
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,070
General,

375
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,680
do you have a solution?

376
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,960
I have a plan,

377
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,350
but it requires Mrs. Sun's cooperation.

378
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Just tell me.

379
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,000
Commander, this is from the King.

380
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,940
(Jun's first branch has been executed.)

381
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,620
(Bring Jun Feifan back immediately.)

382
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,960
Go to Xuan Mansion to save her now.

383
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,910
Yes.

384
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,310
They are deeply in love.

385
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,550
How did it come to this?

386
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,160
With Miss Jun's identity,

387
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,790
she's destined not to be with him.

388
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,030
But I believe they love each other,

389
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,000
and there must be a way

390
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,510
to overcome the barriers between them.

391
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,720
A message from spies in Yannan.

392
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,440
I just sent a message to them.

393
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,430
That was quick.

394
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,670
What's wrong?

395
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,880
Their king executed Mr. Jun

396
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,750
and his two daughters?

397
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,760
What did you say?

398
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
Miss Jun,

399
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,200
it's nothing.

400
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,270
You misheard. It's nothing.

401
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,840
(Jun Chengliu, Jun Xiukun,
and Jun Jiangjuan sentenced to death,)

402
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,260
(and died of poisoned wine in prison.)

403
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,960
Impossible.

404
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,310
Impossible.

405
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,150
Miss Jun,

406
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,730
the young master has ordered

407
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
you not to leave.

408
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,680
Let me go. I want to go back.

409
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,920
- Qimin.
- My Lady, let's go.

410
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,020
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

411
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,460
(Xuan Mansion)

412
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,100
(Xuan Mansion)

413
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,680
The King's men are after me.

414
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,270
I can't escape anyway.

415
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,680
Qimin, you go first.

416
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,790
Xuan Lie won't harm me.

417
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,400
I can't let you take this risk.

418
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll fight our way out.

419
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Listen to me.

420
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,550
The day we fled the northern forest,

421
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,000
I found a river there,

422
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,960
leading to the East Sea.

423
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,640
It's the fastest water route to Yannan.

424
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,200
Head to the Aolong Fort

425
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,110
and find Mr. Shi.

426
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,200
Have him assist me.

427
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,040
My Lady,

428
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,950
Qimin,

429
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,720
only you can help me now.

430
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,550
Please take care of yourself.

431
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,640
Be careful.

432
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,630
(Qimin,)

433
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,830
(whether I can return is up to you.)

434
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,920
I told you to watch her closely.

435
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,750
Why did she come out?

436
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,950
Let me go.

437
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,720
Xuan Lie, let go.

438
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,740
(Light Breeze and Clear Moon)
The guards are everywhere.

439
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,920
If I hadn't come in time,

440
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
you would have died.

441
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,960
So what?

442
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,240
My family died because of me.

443
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,110
What?

444
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Please.

445
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,880
Let me return to Yannan.

446
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,830
I want to see them one last time.

447
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,720
- Qiluo, I've arranged...
- I don't want to hear it.

448
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,940
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

449
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,270
What happened?

450
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,000
I received news from the spies.

451
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,310
Miss Jun's family

452
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,070
was executed by the King of Yannan.

453
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,270
When He Jiyao and I learned of this,

454
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,550
she overheard us.

455
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,400
That's why she was so desperate to go.

456
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,960
It seems

457
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,030
we were still a step late.

458
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,590
Their king acted so fast.

459
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,030
Miss Jun must be heartbroken now.

460
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,640
What should we do now?

461
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,350
There are guards all around.

462
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,350
If we let her leave hastily,

463
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,070
it'll be dangerous.

464
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,000
I'll use the wedding in three days.

465
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,110
Young Master,

466
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,240
you want to take her away

467
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,490
on your wedding day?

468
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,440
That's defying orders.

469
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,070
What about Miss Sun?

470
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,750
I've discussed it with Zhaomin.

471
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,950
Qiluo will marry in her place.

472
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,790
During the wedding feast,

473
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,070
I'll take Qiluo to Yannan.

474
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,640
You both must assist me then.

475
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,760
Yes.

476
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,590
Young Master,

477
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,550
Miss Jun's identity...

478
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,390
He Jiyao.

479
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,670
(Qiluo,)

480
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,550
(I will surely take you to Yannan.)

481
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,670
Qingming,

482
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,070
I've been upset for so long.

483
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,030
Don't you miss me?

484
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,380
Why didn't you come?

485
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,030
Why does your anger concern me?

486
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,240
Just be the Princess of Beixuan.

487
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,070
I'm heading back to Yannan.

488
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,550
I've already kissed you.

489
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,680
You're now my husband.

490
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,960
Without my permission,

491
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,040
you're not going anywhere.

492
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,920
Take him.

493
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,800
What are you doing?

494
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,950
Qingming,

495
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,160
if you don't want to stay,

496
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,070
I'll go back with you.

497
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,110
Let go.

498
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,630
No.

499
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,110
Qingming, let's go.

500
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,240
Qingming,

501
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,720
if we don't leave now,

502
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,550
if the King and Mother find out,

503
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,830
we won't be able to leave.

504
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,550
Let's go now.

505
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,190
Qingming,

506
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,560
what are you doing?

507
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,550
It's a long journey.

508
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,790
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

509
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,280
Get on the horse.

510
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,480
Princess,

511
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,310
let it accompany you from now on.

512
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,900
(Qinghua Token)

513
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,160
(Xuanwu Palace)
The King and Queen Mother arrive.

514
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,070
What's going on?

515
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,830
Greetings, Your Majesties.

516
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,750
What happened?

517
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,510
She left the palace for a day

518
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,830
and fell sick upon her return.

519
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,550
How did you care for the Princess?

520
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,270
Please calm down.

521
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,200
The Princess said

522
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,070
she wanted to find her husband.

523
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,190
Silence.

524
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,510
I have misspoken.

525
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
It was the slave.

526
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,030
After knocking out the Princess,

527
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,440
he left her under a tree all night.

528
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,400
The Princess caught a cold.

529
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,440
The Imperial Physician advised rest.

530
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,030
It's the slave again.

531
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,110
How dare he treat Qingkou like that?

532
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,640
Send someone to capture him now.

533
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,110
Mother, don't harm Qingming.

534
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,590
I'm marrying him.

535
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,070
Don't worry.

536
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,590
I won't harm him.

537
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,640
I will ask the King to go find him,

538
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,480
all right?

539
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,720
Really?

540
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,550
Promise me

541
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
you won't run off again.

542
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,720
Do you know

543
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,550
how worried I am

544
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,960
every time you fall ill?

545
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,870
That's right.

546
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,640
Don't cause trouble like this again.

547
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,350
Every time you leave the palace,

548
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,920
Mother is worried sick.

549
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,510
Brother, I'll be good.

550
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,310
But you'll help me

551
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,640
find Qingming, right?

552
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,440
As long as you behave,

553
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,640
I will help you find him.

554
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,830
All right. Take your medicine.

555
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
Come.

556
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,750
Once you recover,

557
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,200
Qingming will return.

558
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,110
Here.

559
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,030
Any progress with Jun Qiluo?

560
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,000
I spoke with her once.

561
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,270
She's strong-willed,

562
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,550
unlikely to yield Baigong Crafts.

563
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,510
Yet she deeply affects Lie now.

564
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,440
If I use force now,

565
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm afraid there will be a rift with Lie.

566
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,160
We must not let her return to Yannan.

567
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,110
Mother, rest assured.

568
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,200
I've informed Yannan

569
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,960
that Baigong's heir

570
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,030
is now serving Beixuan.

571
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,110
Zhao Guang was furious upon hearing this,

572
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,640
executing Jun Qiluo's entire family.

573
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,750
She now has no way out.

574
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,440
If she learns her family is gone

575
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,070
and Lie is marrying someone else,

576
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,750
with her strong-willed nature,

577
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,640
she might not choose to live on.

578
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,480
If she cannot serve Beixuan,

579
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,830
Yannan losing Baigong's heir

580
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,640
would be acceptable.

581
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,030
Mother, you're wise.

582
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,520
Mom,

583
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,810
these were all bestowed

584
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,680
by the King?

585
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,400
Yes, they're your dowry.

586
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,440
I planned to have General Lie mediate,

587
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,270
so you could inherit

588
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,680
the position of Sun's Clan Leader.

589
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,160
But now,

590
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,270
if you become the Wolf Lord's wife,

591
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,920
our entire Sun Clan

592
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,960
might become your dowry.

593
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,830
It seems the King wishes

594
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,720
to merge the Five Clans this way.

595
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,510
General Lie only has eyes for Qiluo.

596
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,440
If you marry him,

597
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,270
how will you live in the future?

598
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,000
No.

599
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
I must go to the King.

600
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,480
I must go.

601
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,110
Even if it costs me everything,

602
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,310
including the Sun Clan,

603
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,830
I will reject this marriage for you.

604
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,670
Mom.

605
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,200
No need to worry.

606
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,350
In fact,

607
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,200
General Lie and I have devised a plan.

608
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,860
Look.

609
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,790
It says Princess of Sun Clan,

610
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,680
but it doesn't specify which princess.

611
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,110
If you adopt Qiluo as your daughter,

612
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,400
she'll be our princess, too.

613
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,200
That can be done.

614
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,070
But everyone knows

615
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,350
this marriage decree is meant for you.

616
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,640
If the King finds out

617
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,270
we let Qiluo stand in for the wedding,

618
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,920
he won't let us go easily.

619
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,200
General Lie suggested

620
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,640
having Qiluo marry temporarily.

621
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,970
After the wedding banquet,

622
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,240
as long as Liangzhou accepts her

623
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,750
as an adoptive daughter,

624
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,830
I'll be the Young Master,
and she the Princess.

625
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,750
The entire Sun Clan is her family.

626
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,790
That way,

627
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,110
Liangzhou shows loyalty to the King.

628
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,830
So you and the General

629
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,920
pretend to compromise.

630
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,790
If we reveal our plans early,

631
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,790
the King will devise new methods

632
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,790
to force us to marry.

633
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,440
It will become harder to handle then.

634
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,480
Better to feign compliance first.

635
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,200
Catch the King off guard then.

636
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,110
All right.

637
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,400
Do it your way.

638
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,750
- Congrats.
- Congratulations!

639
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,640
Congrats, General Lie.

640
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,200
- Please come in.
- A perfect match.

641
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,060
This way.

642
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,440
(Xuan Mansion)

643
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,280
Congratulations.

644
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,190
- Congrats.
- Come in.

645
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,200
Please come in.

646
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,750
- You're here too?
- Yes.

647
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,960
- Come in.
- Here.

648
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,280
Hurry up.

649
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,910
Quickly.

650
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,350
Keep up.

651
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,270
- Come on.
- All right.

652
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,750
- Go straight.
- Let's go.

653
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,230
- Congrats.
- Please come in.

654
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,150
Congrats, General Lie.

655
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,990
This way.

656
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,400
Congratulations.

657
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,590
A perfect match.

658
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,030
Your Majesty.

659
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,960
How is Lie's wedding?

660
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
Your Majesty,

661
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,590
word's coming in

662
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,760
that it goes as expected.

663
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,550
General Lie has headed

664
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,070
to the Sun Annexe.

665
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,480
There's nothing unusual with Princess Sun.

666
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,800
Go keep a closer watch.

667
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,920
If anything happens,

668
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,230
report immediately.

669
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,760
Understood.

670
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,710
Fire! Fire!

671
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,960
- Quickly, put it out!
- Fire!

672
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,320
Hurry. Fire!

673
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,190
Go get water!

674
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,110
- Hurry up!
- Faster!

675
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,150
- Put it out.
- Hurry!

676
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,360
- Coming.
- Fast.

677
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,870
Quickly.

678
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,120
My Lady.

679
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,030
My Lady.

680
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,470
This way.

681
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,480
Come on.

682
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,800
Take more.

683
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,000
Here, take this.

684
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,230
Come on, take this.

685
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,840
(Wedding Escort)
They're here.

686
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,030
Here they come.

687
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
- So grand.
- Indeed.

688
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,880
(Xuan Mansion)

689
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,280
Mrs. Sun has finally agreed.

690
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,230
The King has been keeping watch.

691
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,190
I can't leave.

692
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,470
Luo Qi,

693
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,800
go inform Qiluo now.

694
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,110
Congratulations.

695
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,550
Congratulations.

696
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,550
Congratulations.

697
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,030
Great.

698
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,660
(Xuan Mansion)

699
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,960
Congratulations.

700
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,800
Congratulations.

701
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,640
Indeed.

702
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,920
What a perfect match.

703
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,070
Congratulations.

704
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,670
Congratulations.

705
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
My Lady, let's go.

706
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,710
Princess.

707
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,630
What's wrong, Princess?

708
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,470
Are you all right?

709
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,070
- The wedding's tedious.
- Princess.

710
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,070
The Princess must be exhausted.

711
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,160
He Jiyao,

712
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,060
take the Princess to her room to rest.

713
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,670
The wedding ceremony is postponed.

714
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,870
Yes.

715
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,550
Young Master.

716
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,800
Be careful.

717
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,870
We have a situation.

718
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,800
Young Master,

719
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,180
before I tell Miss Jun

720
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,910
about our plan,

721
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,150
Meixiang Manor caught fire.

722
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,810
Miss Jun is missing too.

723
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,190
Bring the cavalry and follow me.

724
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,030
Yes.

725
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
Let's go.

726
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,630
Wolf Lord orders

727
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,070
to eliminate the remaining Xi Clan.

728
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,690
Gates closed for three days.

729
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,070
No one is allowed to leave.

730
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,070
Close the gates.

731
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,990
The gates are closed.

732
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,550
- Why close it?
- Why?

733
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,680
What's going on?

734
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,400
That woman, turn around.

735
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,870
You there.

736
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,070
I'll distract them. You go first.

737
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,910
Wait.

738
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,710
If you see Xuan Lie again,

739
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,920
give him this letter.

740
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,910
All right.

741
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,800
- Chase her.
- Quickly.

742
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,230
- Stop.
- Stop right there!

743
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,960
I want to find you.

744
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,320
I want to keep you by my side.

745
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,120
What about you?

746
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,480
Would you stay for me?

747
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,920
The guards are everywhere outside.

748
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,320
If I hadn't come in time,

749
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,190
you would have died.

750
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,560
(Light Breeze and Clear Moon)
So what?

751
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,320
My family died because of me.

752
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,920
Please.

753
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,590
Let me return to Yannan.

754
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,950
