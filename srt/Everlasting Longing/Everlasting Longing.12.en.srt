17
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,070
Young Master Xi,

18
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,840
don't you want to impress your father?

19
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,430
Alright,

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,120
you got it.

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,400
But you have to agree to one condition.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Please go ahead.

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,400
It's simple for you.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,920
You make Xuan Lie lose
the first contest,

25
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,590
and I'll do business with you.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,190
Otherwise, tomorrow I'll sign contracts

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,310
with others.

28
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,630
I'm just a merchant.

29
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,590
I can't get involved in
Beixuan's internal affairs.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,840
Miss, please don't joke.

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,000
You can be Xuan Lie's strategist,

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,120
so he trusts you.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,710
You can also assist the Xi Clan.

34
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,960
And you just said it yourself,

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,840
there are no permanent friends

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,560
or enemies in business.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,840
Besides, who's going to be

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,560
Beixuan's Wolf Lord?

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,800
Does it even matter to you,

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,240
a Yannan merchant?

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
Miss,

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
you're finally back.

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
Are you hurt?

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,470
I'm perfectly fine, see?

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,120
I knew the General would find you.

46
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,710
Miss,

47
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,680
what are you doing?

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,310
Someone tampered with
the General's bow and arrows.

49
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm fixing them for him.

50
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,870
You care so much about the General,

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,240
but he...

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,400
Miss, do you know

53
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,120
once the General becomes the Wolf Lord,

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,030
he'll choose a wife
from the noble ladies?

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,200
I know.

56
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,590
Miss, aren't you upset?

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
Why should I be upset?

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,800
You're doing everything for the general,

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,360
but he's planning to marry someone else.

60
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm just working with him.

61
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,680
Who he marries

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,590
has nothing to do with me.

63
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,800
In my eyes,

64
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,710
the General's recent attitude shows

65
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,280
you're the only one he wants to marry.

66
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,840
He'll marry you sooner or later.

67
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,840
I don't think the General
and I will get there.

68
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,150
Your Majesty, Princess went to
the northern forest

69
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,680
to find a slave named Qingming.

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,960
Qingming?

71
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,600
Do you know his background?

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,380
Since she returned
from the Uncontrollable,

73
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,160
he has always been by her side.

74
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,560
This is all I know.

75
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,780
Investigate the background
of this slave thoroughly.

76
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,790
Yes.

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,950
Not dressed yet?

78
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,120
Quite dashing!

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
You're now

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
the most handsome eunuch in Beixuan.

81
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,790
Where are you going?

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
What now?

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,870
As my eunuch, you'll go wherever I go,

84
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,190
protect me, and follow my orders.

85
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,310
From now on, you'll be with me all the time.

86
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,900
Father,

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,120
we tampered with Xuan Lie's Wushao Bow,

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,680
but now he's using another one.

89
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,750
Our plan might be ruined.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Your archery's good,

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,430
and he won't use Wushao Bow.

92
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,430
We might still have a chance.

93
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,910
Don't worry, Father.

94
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,750
Jun Qiluo will help us.

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,950
That woman is full of schemes.

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
How can you trust her words?

97
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Father, don't worry.

98
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,270
Now that the mine is in our hands,

99
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,430
and she wants it,

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,840
she'll help us.

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,880
Never mind.

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,430
Let's see her choice.

103
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,430
Proceed as planned.

104
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,670
Yes.

105
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,950
I knew Miss Jun is still upset.

106
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,190
Otherwise, why wouldn't she
return the Wushao Bow?

107
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,030
Young Master,

108
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,980
the contest comes first.

109
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,270
We'd better handle it later.

110
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,150
General,

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,640
here's your bow.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
This safety knot is for you.

113
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,030
You must win.

114
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,710
Don't miss it.

115
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,950
Lie's archery is

116
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,390
top-notch in Beixuan.

117
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,040
The Hunting Event
consists of three rounds:

118
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,630
training, hunting,
and territory exercises.

119
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,510
The winners can place
their clan's plaque on the podium.

120
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,950
Each winning team in the contest

121
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,660
(Su, Sun, Luo, Xi, Xuan)
gets five plaques,

122
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,160
and so forth.

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
The one with the most plaques

124
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,630
at the end of the contests wins

125
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,920
and becomes the Beixuan Wolf Lord,

126
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,390
holding the Five Clans' Military Token

127
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,430
and commanding their armies.

128
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,590
Yes.

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Yes.

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,240
The first round
of the training exercise begins now.

131
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Leaders, please take eight warriors each

132
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,800
into the withered woods.

133
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,720
Anyone hit by a colored arrow

134
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,720
is out.

135
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,390
If the Leader is hit,

136
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,430
the whole team is out.

137
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,950
The last Leader in the woods

138
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,190
will light a signal flare
in their clan's color,

139
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,160
marking the end of the first round.

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Let's go!

141
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,870
Zhaomin,

142
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
you are impressive.

143
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm here to protect you.

144
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,440
Shameless!

145
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Zhaomin, wait for me!

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,840
Leave me alone.

147
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
Father.

148
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,870
Xi Mo!

149
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,080
How dare you set a trap!

150
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,230
This doesn't count.

151
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,440
There's no rule against traps.

152
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,560
Princess,

153
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
don't be a sore loser.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
You...

155
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,120
You got him out too.

156
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,870
It's not that bad for us.

157
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,150
Not bad? Seriously?

158
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
You're the Leader.

159
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,630
He hit you,

160
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,270
which means our entire Sun Clan is out.

161
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,870
The Xi and Sun are related by blood.

162
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,320
We should unite,

163
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,000
but you chose to support Xuan.

164
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,790
So I couldn't hold back.

165
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,670
Mr. Sun, please don't blame me.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,120
The Xi Clan uses strategy wisely,

167
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,750
and the Sun Clan learned that today.

168
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,790
But bad intentions won't

169
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,840
make strategy last.

170
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,360
The Xi Clan should

171
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,320
be careful in the next rounds.

172
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,960
Father...

173
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,120
Why are you so down?

174
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,550
Just because he eliminated me?

175
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm upset that he won unfairly,

176
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,790
but I can't report him.

177
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,510
Everything in the contests
should be respected.

178
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,480
Victory and defeat
must be fair and square.

179
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,120
Today, he had the advantage

180
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,150
but still needed two arrows to hit us.

181
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,510
You took him out with one.

182
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,790
That shows your archery
is way beyond his.

183
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,150
Just stay alert and cautious

184
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,320
in future contests,

185
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,510
and you'll definitely win with ease.

186
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,360
General Lie,

187
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,670
how can you do without your weapon?

188
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,990
Lie,

189
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,870
you all go first.

190
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,710
Okay.

191
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,590
Mr. Luo,

192
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,270
what are you doing?

193
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't you want to become the Wolf Lord?

194
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
Xuan Lie will lose this contest for sure.

195
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,510
Just wait and see.

196
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,560
Mr. Xi,

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
have you done

198
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,270
something shady again?

199
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,390
Xuan Lie got the wrong read on people.

200
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,840
The broken bowstring is proof.

201
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,870
Your Majesty,

202
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
the Sun was eliminated before the Su.

203
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,910
And Young Master Xi Mo
was hit by Princess Zhaomin,

204
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,750
so he's out too.

205
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,440
Princess Zhaomin is
no less inferior to men.

206
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,270
What about Lie?

207
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,550
General Lie's bowstring broke.

208
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,960
Deputy He is out.

209
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,550
Deputy Luo is protecting him now.

210
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,440
What? How did his bowstring break?

211
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,390
Is the bow

212
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,910
the one Jun Qiluo gave to Lie?

213
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,480
I knew she had bad intentions.

214
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,680
Enough.

215
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,870
Don't stir things up.

216
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,030
We'll deal with it after the contest.

217
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,480
See? Jun Qiluo

218
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,720
is evil and spiteful.

219
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,110
Young Master, take my bow.

220
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,530
Take it and keep Xuan's hope alive.

221
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,440
Young Master!

222
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
Keep up with me!

223
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,030
General Lie's bowstring broke.

224
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,000
Will he be alright?

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
As long as he finishes in the top three

226
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,160
and wins two more rounds,

227
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,080
he can still become the Wolf Lord.

228
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,680
Yi,

229
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,000
don't run around everywhere.

230
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,750
- Greetings, Consort Li.
- Greetings, Consort Li.

231
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,590
Please rise.

232
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,510
Are you the Yannan woman

233
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,870
General Lie brought back?

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,480
Your hat is coming apart.

235
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,320
Let me have a look.

236
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,910
Xin, take it back and mend it.

237
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,630
- It can still last another year.
- Yes.

238
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,000
Consort Li, why not give it to me?

239
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,600
I'll mend it and return it to you.

240
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
Sounds good.

241
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,510
Miss Qiluo, I heard you
come from the Juns in Yannan.

242
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,440
You must be very skilled.

243
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Your efforts to open trade
between the Juns and Sun Clan

244
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,800
have already spread
across the Royal City.

245
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,630
Who brought real weapons to the woods?

246
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
There's an ambush! Run!

247
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,680
Luo Qi!

248
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,800
Retreat!

249
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,710
Luo Qi.

250
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,840
Young Master, don't worry about me.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,440
There's an ambush. You should go.

252
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,230
Let's go.

253
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,160
General Lie.

254
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,920
If you leave now,

255
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,720
the second place will not be yours.

256
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,590
Mr. Xi, you've set this ambush,

257
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
and if I lose to you,

258
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
people will laugh at you.

259
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,400
If Xuan ranks third,

260
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,880
will you be at ease?

261
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,350
Let's go.

262
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,160
Mr. Luo has won!

263
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,390
Your Majesty,

264
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,160
Mr. Luo hit Mr. Xi and won this round.

265
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,880
Both Mr. Xi and General Lie fired arrows

266
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,720
at each other

267
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,960
and were both hit.

268
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,480
General Lie gave up second place.

269
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,430
Alright.

270
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,070
Now, for Lie,

271
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,550
Luo Qi's life

272
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,680
is more important than the contest.

273
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Announce the result.

274
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,800
Yes.

275
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,010
The first round is over.

276
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,800
Xuan Clan earned three plaques.

277
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,110
Xi Clan earned four plaques.

278
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,880
Luo Clan earned five plaques.

279
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,310
Sun Clan earned one plaque.

280
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,830
Su Clan earned two plaques.

281
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:31,180
(Chiyan Pass)

282
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,760
Mr. Jun,

283
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,560
we came to this Chiyan Gorge
as they told us,

284
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
but where is everyone?

285
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,110
Let's wait and see.

286
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,630
Yes.

287
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,750
Are you the Jun Manager?

288
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,310
Yes, I'm.

289
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,960
Greetings, sirs.

290
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,070
I received a letter from your Leader

291
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,350
stating a hostage exchange here,

292
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,830
but why don't I see the hostage?

293
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,550
Fellows, listen to my order!

294
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,350
Whoever kills him today,

295
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,180
- will berewarded 1,000 silver taels!
- You...

296
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,000
How can you go back on your word?

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,840
Get him!

298
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,960
Mr. Jun, hurry!

299
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
Mr. Jun.

300
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,750
I'm afraid we've fallen into a trap.

301
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,590
We need to leave now.

302
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,480
Qi, shall we go back now?

303
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,100
General Lie and the others are here.

304
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,680
How did Luo Qi get injured?

305
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,870
How is he?

306
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,830
Luckily, the arrow missed by a cun,

307
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,170
so it didn't hit a vital spot.

308
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,200
But it was coated
with anesthetic powder,

309
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,240
which knocked the Deputy unconscious.

310
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,270
What do you want to say?

311
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,200
Jun Qiluo gave you
that bowstring, didn't she?

312
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,950
Yes, she did.

313
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,190
What's the matter?

314
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,000
Xi Changkun said

315
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,830
that Xi Mo met Jun Qiluo today.

316
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,320
Impossible.

317
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,910
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

318
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
General Lie!

319
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,800
How is Luo Qi?

320
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
What did you do to the bowstring?

321
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,590
What do you mean?

322
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,400
You met Xi Mo this afternoon? What for?

323
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,350
I told you, just tell me what you want.

324
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,000
Why won't you trust me?

325
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,280
Xuan Lie,

326
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,110
they are about to sell the mine

327
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,680
and sign the contract with someone else.

328
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,730
I can't wait any longer.

329
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,920
So you betrayed me.

330
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I thought that by now,

331
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,430
we could trust each other,

332
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,310
but I was just fooling myself.

333
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,790
Do you know how close

334
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,270
Luo Qi came to dying?

335
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,680
Xuan Lie,

336
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,590
you have your duty

337
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
to become the Wolf Lord
and protect Beixuan.

338
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,550
But I have my mission too.

339
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,480
To safeguard the Juns' legacy
for Jun Feifan,

340
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,270
I must find the black iron crystal.

341
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,830
No matter who becomes the Wolf Lord,

342
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,310
it won't be good for Yannan.

343
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,960
So why should I help you

344
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,110
achieve your goal

345
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,000
while risking the future of the Juns?

346
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,880
I've said that
once I become the Wolf Lord,

347
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,550
I will never allow war to happen.

348
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,720
Why won't you trust me?

349
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,720
Fine.

350
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,440
I've trusted
the wrong person these days.

351
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,200
From now on, we part ways.

352
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,510
As you wish.

353
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,000
Father,

354
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,160
that Qiluo girl is pretty impressive.

355
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,720
I can't believe she set up Xuan Lie

356
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,440
to get the black iron crystal.

357
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,590
Now they have parted ways.

358
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,920
Is she really the one
behind Luo Qi's injury?

359
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,160
I'm afraid so.

360
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,440
To sever Xuan Lie's wings,

361
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,030
Luo Qi and He Jiyao
should be taken out first.

362
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,640
That woman is truly clever.

363
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,680
We can't let our guard down.

364
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,830
She's been with Xuan Lie for so long,

365
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,310
and now she's betrayed him
for a business deal.

366
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,960
Who knows if she will

367
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,240
turn against us in the future?

368
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,480
Yes, Father.

369
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,110
I'll be extra careful.

370
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,720
But there's no need to fear her just yet.

371
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,960
As long as we delay
signing the mine contract,

372
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,790
she'll keep working for us.

373
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,790
Although she's crafty,

374
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,240
she's also very capable.

375
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,240
If we can keep her on our side forever,

376
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,240
it could be a good thing.

377
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,070
You want to tame her?

378
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,270
That's not going to be easy.

379
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,160
Today, though Luo Zhizhou made a gain,

380
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,960
at least Xuan Lie didn't win.

381
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
You've done well with it.

382
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,160
But remember, stay alert

383
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,750
for the next two rounds.

384
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,160
Lie has only earned
three plaques for now.

385
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,350
If he loses another round,

386
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,580
he might lose his chance
of becoming the Wolf Lord.

387
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,160
It's all his own fault

388
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,200
for trusting that Jun Qiluo!

389
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,430
You,

390
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,720
pick that up for me!

391
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

392
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,680
You're now my eunuch.

393
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,310
Do as I say!

394
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,670
Pick it up again.

395
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,110
Since when did you become so obedient?

396
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,720
When Princess is upset,

397
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,350
it's the servants' job to calm her down.

398
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
If Princess's anger affects others,

399
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,070
it's a failure on our part.

400
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,310
So, are you worried
I'll blame Jun Qiluo?

401
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,240
Are you worried I'll hurt her?

402
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,600
With me here, you won't be able to.

403
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,030
Don't worry.

404
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,000
As long as you follow my orders,

405
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,240
I won't hurt her.

406
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,790
Qingming knows the merchant woman
with Xuan Lie?

407
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,160
Yes, Princess was furious.

408
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,000
She said Qingming
listened to her for the sake

409
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,840
of that Yannan woman.

410
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,350
Princess doesn't
allow us servants near her tent,

411
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,200
so that's all we could find out.

412
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,480
Could he also be from Yannan?

413
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,550
Whoever he is,

414
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,200
I can't let such a dangerous person

415
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,550
stay by Qingkou's side.

416
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,270
- General.
- General.

417
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Miss Qiluo,

418
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,750
have you had breakfast?

419
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,510
Mr. Xi, I've done

420
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,350
what you asked.

421
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,070
Isn't it time for me
to get the black iron crystals?

422
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,110
No rush.

423
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,720
I'll keep the mine for you.

424
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,960
Since you chose Xi's side,

425
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,350
I'll certainly help you all the way.

426
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,110
Everyone knows I've parted ways

427
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,440
with Xuan Lie, but still,

428
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,270
you don't trust me.

429
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,110
My father and I both see

430
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,000
your sincerity, Miss Qiluo.

431
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,240
But as you said,

432
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,160
people know you've parted ways,

433
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,830
not that you're with us.

434
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,000
For the next hunting exercise,

435
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,230
the Wild Forest is treacherous.

436
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,510
The King has promised

437
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,590
that tomorrow, warriors from all clans
can enter the Wild Forest

438
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,330
to familiarize themselves
with the terrain.

439
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,960
Miss Qiluo, you'll accompany me

440
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,590
so everyone knows

441
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,880
you're under my command.

442
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,320
What do you think?

443
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,830
Do you have any other conditions?

444
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,180
Go ahead and state them all.

445
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,030
Miss Qiluo, you're truly impressive.

446
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,030
You managed to craft such a meticulous plan

447
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,000
in such a short time yesterday.

448
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,920
You made Xuan Lie lose his Wushao Bow

449
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,750
and got Luo Qi injured.

450
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,680
I'm no match for you.

451
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,830
With your incredible abilities,

452
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,920
why not help my father
become the Wolf Lord?

453
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,110
That way, you can have as many

454
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
black iron crystals as you want,

455
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,240
and the Juns won't have to pay double.

456
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,550
It's a great deal.

457
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,920
Don't you think
it's worth considering, Miss Qiluo?

458
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,240
(The one who injured Luo Qi
wasn't one of Xi Mo's men.)

459
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,510
I'm afraid you don't
have time to think, Miss Qiluo.

460
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,790
In business, integrity is most important.

461
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,880
We haven't signed any contract,

462
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,030
but you're asking me to act.

463
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,550
It doesn't work like that.

464
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,030
The mine is in our Xi Clan's hands.

465
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,270
Do you have any other choice?

466
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,640
Yesterday, I made Xuan Lie lose,

467
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,350
and tomorrow, I can make Xi lose

468
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,590
without anyone knowing.

469
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,760
No wonder

470
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,480
Xuan Lie would let a woman

471
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,640
be his strategist.

472
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,200
I'll go to the Wild Forest with you,

473
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,270
but before the next round begins,

474
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,680
the first batch of black iron crystals

475
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,640
must be sent to Yannan.

476
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,510
My request isn't too much, is it?

477
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,720
Mo,

478
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,880
you can't agree to her terms.

479
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,830
Since she betrayed General Lie,

480
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,550
she could betray you too.

481
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,750
Don't be deceived by her.

482
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,080
This isn't your concern.

483
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,750
Princess,

484
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,480
you like General Lie, don't you?

485
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,870
That's right.

486
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,590
I do like General Lie.

487
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,310
So, if you dare hurt him,

488
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I won't let you off.

489
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,790
That's enough!

490
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,710
Yu...

491
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,530
I shouldn't meddle in
your family matters.

492
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,630
I'll take my leave now.

493
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,720
Don't hurt General Lie!

494
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,720
Did you hear me?

495
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,070
Stop it.

496
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,110
You...

497
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,110
How is Luo Qi's injury?

498
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,080
Luo Qi wasn't fatally injured.

499
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,590
He'll be fine in a few days.

500
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,000
The following rounds will get tougher.

501
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,510
Can you handle it?

502
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,640
I'm fine now.

503
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,000
It's just that
I lost the first round yesterday.

504
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Please forgive me, Xu.

505
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,680
The result is settled,

506
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,350
so don't dwell on it.

507
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,830
But from now on,

508
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,680
you must win every round.

509
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,310
Yesterday, you had a big fight
with that Yannan merchant woman,

510
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,270
and everyone knows about it.

511
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,590
That was inappropriate.

512
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,640
I warned you early on

513
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,480
that woman came from Yannan

514
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,160
and can't be fully trusted.

515
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,160
Now, not only did she
cost you the contest,

516
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,960
but she also got Luo Qi injured.

517
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,110
Maybe we should deal with her for good.

518
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,320
Xu,

519
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,190
no.

520
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,270
Why not?

521
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,590
She's just Jun Feifan's maid.

522
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,030
Moreover, ever since she came to Beixuan,

523
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,440
she has been causing trouble.

524
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,400
And now, you haven't found

525
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,920
any solid evidence on her.

526
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,920
We should've never let her live.

527
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,080
Xu,

528
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,680
she is not Jun Feifan's maid.

529
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,110
She's Jun Qiluo, his eldest sister.

530
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,680
Jun Qiluo?

531
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,960
Exactly. She wasn't the one
behind the ambush

532
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,130
in the woods yesterday.

533
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,000
At this point,

534
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
do you still trust her?

535
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,310
She returned with me yesterday.

536
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,640
She has no power in Beixuan,

537
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,200
so she couldn't have set this up.

538
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,310
Do you know who those people were?

539
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,070
Their method was similar
to the ones who ambushed me

540
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,110
in the forest.

541
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,960
I suspect they are from the Five Clans.

542
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,550
But without concrete proof,

543
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,880
I can't speak up for you.

544
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,200
So now,

545
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,480
give your all to win the contests.

546
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,160
Only by winning
and becoming the Wolf Lord

547
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,230
can you protect yourself from others.

548
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,720
Yes, Xu.

549
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,110
"Where do you gather the white mugwort?"

550
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,480
"On the sandbar by the marsh."

551
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,000
"What's it for?"

552
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,180
- "For rituals..."
- Your Ladyship,

553
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,450
Miss Qiluo requests an audience.

554
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,790
Let her in.

555
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,630
Yes, Your Ladyship.

556
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,200
- Continue.
- "For rituals in noble houses."

557
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,590
"Where do you gather the white mugwort?"

558
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,440
- "By the mountain stream."
- "By the..."

559
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,110
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

560
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,430
Please rise.

561
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,000
I've mended Prince Yi's hat.

562
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,500
The craftsmanship
of the Juns is incredible.

563
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,200
No signs of mending at all.

564
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,270
It looks as good as new.

565
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

566
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,670
Here you go, Yi.

567
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,870
You're sharp.

568
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,440
Yi, why don't you go play
outside for a while?

569
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,550
Are you doing well with General Lie?

570
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,670
Foreign women in Beixuan

571
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,000
must learn to read the room.

572
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,710
If a girl marries into
royalty or nobility,

573
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,510
there will be many hardships and sorrows,

574
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,800
and she'll have to

575
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,280
endure them in silence.

576
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,480
Your Ladyship, the King bringing you
to the Hunting Event,

577
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,760
shows how important you are to him.

578
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,710
Why say such gloomy things?

579
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,920
These are just temporary.

580
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,230
All I hope for now is
that Yi stays safe and sound.

581
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,880
Everything else

582
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,230
doesn't matter much to me.

583
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,630
Miss Qiluo, I heard you

584
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,480
went to the Xi Clan's tent
early this morning.

585
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,800
Is there really no chance

586
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,180
for you and General Lie to make up?

587
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,190
Yi has always been naughty,

588
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,000
and he's growing so fast that many of

589
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,150
his clothes don't fit
before he even wears them.

590
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,630
If you have some time,

591
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,730
perhaps you could teach me.

592
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,920
That way, as Yi's mother,

593
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,480
I can mend his clothes myself.

594
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,110
You're too kind.

595
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,230
It is my honor.

596
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,950
Open the door!

597
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,510
- Coming.
- Open the door!

598
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,670
Who's knocking? Why the rush?

599
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,510
Bad news, Uncle Ling.

600
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,630
Mr. Jun has had an accident.

601
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,480
Mr. Jun! Mr. Jun!

602
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,510
Help! Someone, help!

603
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,720
Mr. Jun!

604
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,200
Mr. Jun!

605
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,280
Physician, how is my father?

606
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,070
Mr. Jun is gravely injured.

607
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,840
Though he survived,

608
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,070
I'm afraid he may never walk again.

609
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,880
When will he wake up?

610
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,590
It depends on his luck.

611
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
It could be a few days,

612
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,360
or several years.

613
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,720
Father!

614
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,760
Father...

615
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,910
Uncle Ling.

616
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,060
Yes, Miss.

617
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,840
Please bring in other physicians,

618
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,920
the best ones in the Royal Capital.

619
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,190
I refuse to believe
no one can heal Father.

620
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,030
Yes.

621
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Uncle Ling, bring the most expensive ones!

622
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
Bring the best ones.

623
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,030
The best in the Royal Capital!

624
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,960
Bring them all here!

625
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,630
- Please wake up.
- Bring them all here!

626
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:49,660
(Miss Qiluo will go to the Wild Forest
with the Xi Clan tomorrow.)

627
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,320
Jun Qiluo switched allegiance
to Xi Changkun

628
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,960
for black iron crystals.

629
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,260
She can easily make the Xuan Clan
lose the contest,

630
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,880
which could later

631
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,000
jeopardize my plans.

632
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,000
We should get rid of her.

633
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,000
She'll go to the Wild Forest.

634
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,880
It's time for you to act tomorrow.

635
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,440
Yes, Mr. Luo.

636
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,600
Mr. Luo,

637
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,320
it's getting cold.

638
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,670
Your old ailment might flare up again.

639
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,480
Please take your medicine on time.

640
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,960
Just do what you need to do.

641
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,760
You may leave now.

642
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,190
Yes, I understand.

643
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,230
