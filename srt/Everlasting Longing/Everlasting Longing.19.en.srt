=Episode 19=

17
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,070
Luckily, a servant from the Xi Mansion

19
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,950
told me about the red bean bracelet.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,480
I remember it clearly.

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,950
Only Jun Qiluo has a red bean bracelet.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,230
She killed Li Tao.

23
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,040
She instructed Li Tao to harm my father.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,630
Princess,

25
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,920
just based on a red bean bracelet,

26
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,750
you can't draw conclusions hastily.

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,310
If it wasn't Jun Qiluo,

28
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,150
how could the red bean bracelet

29
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,960
be found on Li Tao?

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,800
Jun Qiluo is cunning.

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,030
First, she killed my brother.

33
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,520
She feared my father's retaliation,

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,240
so she framed my father.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,150
My father was killed by her.

36
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,870
Xi Changkun trafficked arms

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,710
and killed a Clan Leader.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,560
The evidence is irrefutable.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,120
How could it have been a frame-up?

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Xu,

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,030
Qiluo has no reason to kill Xi Changkun.

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,520
This must have been a frame-up.

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,840
Since the maid had Jun Qiluo's bracelet,

44
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,840
we can imprison her

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,190
and interrogate her.

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,960
I want to see her true intentions.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Xu,

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,240
Qiluo only wanted to help me
become the Wolf Lord.

49
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,710
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,710
General Lie wants to protect Jun Qiluo.

51
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,560
Jun Qiluo killed my brother

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,840
and my father.

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,870
Your Majesty, please punish her.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,430
Enough.

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
I will investigate this.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
You may leave.

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,030
I once liked you

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
and trusted you,

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,430
but now you distort the truth
for Jun Qiluo,

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,280
ignoring my father's tragic death.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
No one knows

62
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,750
the truth yet.

63
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,750
Xuan Lie,

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,750
you've been bewitched by her.

65
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,430
Jun Qiluo is a disaster.

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,870
You two plotted to convict my father.

67
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,680
She killed my father.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
I curse both of you

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
for never having peace.

70
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,000
Jun Qiluo is indeed quite scheming.

71
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,480
I've always had doubts
about her coming here.

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,950
Now, I can interrogate her
in the prison.

73
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,110
Xu, Qiluo is very cautious.

74
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,470
If we imprison her rashly,
we might not get any answers.

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,160
Please give me some time.

76
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,750
I will find out the truth.

77
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,390
Are you afraid we won't get anything?

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,270
Or do you want to protect her?

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
I know.

80
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,660
You refused the marriage alliance
with Princess Sun

81
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,070
because of her.

82
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,720
But Lie, as the Wolf Lord,

83
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,190
how can you be so tangled in love?

84
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,150
Xu,

85
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,190
that has nothing to do with her.

86
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,040
- It's just...
- What?

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
With this happening,

88
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,680
you still intend to protect her.

89
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,940
Lie,

90
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,660
I'm doing this for your own good.

91
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,830
The Five Clans are not unified yet.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
If you have a weakness now,

93
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,120
how can you secure
the Wolf Lord position?

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,840
I know clearly

95
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,190
you have developed
true feelings for her.

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,950
Now you're protecting her.

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
She can no longer stay alive.

98
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,190
Spread my order:

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,830
Jun Qiluo killed
a maid of the Xi Mansion.

100
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,430
She might be a Yannan spy.

101
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,750
She shall be imprisoned

102
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,370
and tortured for confession.

103
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,230
Wait.

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,590
The reason why I kept her by my side

105
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,480
was not only
because there were many doubts

106
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
about Mr. Xi's death.

107
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,350
Qiluo...

108
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
Jun Qiluo

109
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,800
is the Baigong's heir,

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,270
Jun Feifan.

111
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,910
What?

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,070
She's the Baigong's heir?

113
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Those Baigong weapons

114
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,240
that have been defending Yannan

115
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,750
from our attacks come from a woman?

116
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,240
Is General Xuan Shu's death

117
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,630
also related to her?

118
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,190
I'm still investigating.

119
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,310
Xu, please give me

120
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,000
more time.

121
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
In that case,

122
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,630
I'll give you time to investigate.

123
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,070
But you must remember.

124
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,510
If she is really the Baigong's heir,

125
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,480
you must find a way

126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,830
to make her serve Beixuan.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,510
She must never return to Yannan.

128
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,190
I understand.

129
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,560
I believe you won't disappoint me.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
You may leave.

131
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,910
Yes.

132
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
It seems Lie

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,320
has known for a long time
that Jun Qiluo is the Baigong's heir,

134
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,480
but he has never told me.

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
He is too deeply in love.

136
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,310
We must sever her escape routes

137
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,630
so she can never return to Yannan.

138
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
You go tell the spies in Yannan

139
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,800
to let the King of Yannan know

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,830
that the Baigong's heir is now
in my service.

141
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,390
Your Majesty, how wise of you.

142
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,360
Don't let Lie know about this for now.

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,270
Keep an eye on Jun Qiluo.

144
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,160
If there's any unusual movement,
arrest her immediately.

145
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,600
Be careful. Don't let anyone notice.

146
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,030
Yes.

147
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,540
(Xuan Mansion)

148
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,660
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

149
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,410
My Lady,

150
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,560
I went to the Xi Manor
during the day to gather info.

151
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
When Xi Jixiu's maid died,

152
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,680
she was holding a red bean bracelet.

153
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,080
So, he thinks that I might be

154
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,630
related to Xi Changkun's death.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,780
(You have developed
true feelings for her.)

156
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,630
(Now you're protecting her.)

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,820
(She can no longer stay alive.)

158
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,750
(Qiluo,)

159
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,720
(I'll protect you.)

160
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,550
Once I find the trade token,

161
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,010
I'll go back to Yannan with you.

162
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,020
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

163
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,220
(Qingtang Manor)

164
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,790
Lie, drink with me.

165
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
I haven't heard from you recently.

166
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,910
You must be troubled by something,

167
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,790
so today I asked you to drink with me.

168
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,390
If you're upset,

169
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
feel free to tell me.

170
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,200
Over the years,

171
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,670
only you can read my mood
at a glance.

172
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,660
We brothers truly understand each other.

173
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,230
Before Xi Changkun died, he revealed

174
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,420
that at the Hunting Event,

175
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,110
someone besides him

176
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
wanted to kill me.

177
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,800
Besides him?

178
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,600
Who could that be?

179
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,300
After thinking it over,

180
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,870
based on the time they acted,

181
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,740
I think they're
after the Wolf Lord position.

182
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,270
Among the Five Clans,

183
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,080
besides the Xuan and Xi,

184
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,790
there are only the Sun, Su,

185
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,270
and my Luo.

186
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,260
Mr. Sun risked his life to save you,

187
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
so the Sun Clan wouldn't harm you.

188
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,670
The Su Clan is weak

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,960
and has no interest in the position.

190
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,970
That means it can only be

191
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,960
my Luo Clan.

192
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,720
Logically speaking,

193
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,600
your suspicion is indeed very high.

194
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,670
So, it's me

195
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,550
who wanted to kill you?

196
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,990
You wouldn't.

197
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,150
Everyone in this world
might want to kill me,

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,630
but you wouldn't.

199
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,750
Thank you for trusting me.

200
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,630
I have to go.

201
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,270
Let's drink properly another day.

202
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,080
What's so urgent?

203
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,490
Didn't we agree
to enjoy ourselves today?

204
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,150
He Jiyao found out

205
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,550
that before the Xi maid died,

206
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,360
she met a mysterious woman.

207
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,510
That woman should be at a residence
in the bamboo forest.

208
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
I'll go check it myself.

209
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,390
Miss Jun.

210
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
Miss Jun.

211
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,390
It snowed suddenly last night.

212
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,710
The weather has gotten colder.

213
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,200
The young master ordered us

214
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,750
to prepare some thick clothes for you.

215
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,550
Our young master really cares about you.

216
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,230
The dungeon is cold.

217
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,940
Prepare some clothes for Dongyin too

218
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,680
and send them over.

219
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,200
You're so kind to Dongyin.

220
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,340
You've not only taught her
to weave and embroider

221
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,130
but also given her a way
to make a living.

222
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
(Embroidery?)

223
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,000
It's so beautiful.

224
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,160
I'll leave now.

225
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,240
(The embroidery on the wrist guard
used the same skills as on the hat.)

226
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,100
Miss Jun, where are you going?

227
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,120
You forgot your clothes.

228
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,500
(Heavenly Prison)

229
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
My Lady.

230
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
So, your master is him?

231
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,720
What are you saying?

232
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,240
I don't understand.

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,120
Yesterday, he set a trap for Xuan Lie
but was caught.

234
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,200
Now he's locked in the Heavenly Prison,

235
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,790
but he begged Xuan Lie
to spare your life.

236
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,870
He really...

237
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,910
Who would have thought

238
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,120
the mastermind behind all this was him?

239
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,350
My Lady.

240
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,920
My Lady.

241
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,000
The poisoning...

242
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,150
He didn't do it.

243
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,790
He didn't frame General Lie.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,810
He truly treated General Lie
like a brother.

245
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,000
Like a brother?

246
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,910
So, it really was Luo Zhizhou.

247
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,160
My Lady.

248
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
My Lady.

249
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,750
It was my decision.

250
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,110
It has nothing to do with him.

251
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
You finally came.

252
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,320
Zhizhou,

253
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,750
it's really you.

254
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,750
You've suspected me long ago.

255
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,510
I only told you

256
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,670
about my coming here.

257
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,200
So,

258
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,320
you said the mysterious woman
would come here

259
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,360
to lure me into the trap.

260
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
I treated you like a brother

261
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,000
and never suspected you,

262
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,960
until today when I saw that painting

263
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,350
in your room.

264
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Those flowers

265
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
were Eight Treasure Sedum, right?

266
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,270
As I know,

267
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,400
Consort Li's favorite flower
is Eight Treasure Sedum.

268
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
You once told me

269
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
about a woman you loved
but couldn't have.

270
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,680
If I'm not wrong,

271
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,030
she's Consort Li, right?

272
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,510
I met her in Xixiang.

273
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,590
At that time,

274
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,960
I was isolated.

275
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,160
She was the only one
who came close to me.

276
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,550
Later, we grew feelings for each other.

277
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,750
But just the day before I was going
to propose to her,

278
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,550
the King of Xixiang ordered

279
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,000
that Fanyin be sent as a Princess
to marry the King of Beixuan.

280
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,550
As a foreign woman in the Palace,

281
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,310
she had no one to protect her.

282
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,310
If I became the Wolf Lord,

283
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
I could protect her better.

284
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
Only then could I support Prince Yi

285
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,400
and have a chance

286
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
to take her away from the Palace.

287
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,590
Is this the reason you betrayed me?

288
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,190
Lie,

289
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,350
for her

290
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,550
and Yi,

291
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,070
I had no choice.

292
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,310
You led me into the forest.

293
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,030
You tried to kill me
at the Spring Festival.

294
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
You also killed Mr. Sun!

295
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,270
If I must die by your hands,

296
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,900
so be it.

297
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,030
Lie,

298
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,110
go ahead.

299
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,550
If you still wish,

300
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,030
we can be brothers in the next life.

301
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,830
The King has ordered

302
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,270
the arrest of Luo Leader Luo Zhizhou.

303
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
You've assassinated Lie multiple times.

304
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,030
You even killed Mr. Sun.

305
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,780
I deserve to die a thousand deaths.

306
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,590
My life is at your disposal.

307
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,920
Of course, I'll tear you apart.

308
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,000
But Consort Li must go down with you.

309
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,200
Your Majesty, why?

310
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,400
You once released a kite
outside her tent

311
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,070
to make her smile.

312
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,110
That has nothing to do with Consort Li.

313
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,350
I've had my people investigate.

314
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,270
Before entering the Palace,

315
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,830
Li Fanyin and you were very close.

316
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,830
Even on the eve of her marriage,

317
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,510
she was willing to elope with you.

318
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,830
Do you

319
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,830
deny this?

320
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,400
Your Majesty, please calm down.

321
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,510
What I had for Consort Li

322
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,310
was only one-sided love.

323
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,110
She saw me as nothing more
than a brother.

324
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,960
As for the elopement,

325
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,000
it was because I mistakenly thought

326
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,480
Consort Li didn't want to marry,

327
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
so I took her away from Xixiang.

328
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,790
Later, I learned

329
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,790
that Consort Li truly loved you,

330
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,680
and I gave up the idea.

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,720
Do you take me for a three-year-old?

332
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,550
Now, you'd stop at nothing
for the Wolf Lord position,

333
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,750
even trying to kill Lie.

334
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,070
Isn't all this

335
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,240
directly related to Consort Li?

336
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,680
I no longer have any affection
for Consort Li.

337
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,960
There's no reason for me

338
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,480
to sacrifice my life for her.

339
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,640
I want to be the Wolf Lord

340
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,110
because I don't want
to always be beneath Lie.

341
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,200
You speak without flaw,

342
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,800
but

343
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,110
why should I believe you?

344
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,200
In my view,

345
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,750
you refuse to believe that

346
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,510
for another reason.

347
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,350
How outrageous!

348
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,720
Only she and I know about our past

349
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,960
in Beixuan.

350
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,960
If you want to investigate,

351
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,000
you must send someone to Xixiang.

352
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,640
But from Beixuan to Xixiang,

353
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,750
even at full speed,
it takes at least three days.

354
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
But you only knew about the kite today.

355
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,440
Then you knew everything.

356
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,000
If I was right,

357
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
you must've known our past long ago.

358
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
You're very clever.

359
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,240
The entire Beixuan is under my control.

360
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,880
How could I not know

361
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,790
about your past with Consort Li?

362
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,790
Since you've already known,

363
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,110
why only bring it up now?

364
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,750
Being unable to unite the Five Clans

365
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,200
has always been a thorn in your heart.

366
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,960
What you want most now

367
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,510
should be the Luo Leader Seal

368
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,640
in my hands.

369
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,910
Yes.

370
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
So what?

371
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,880
I am willing to offer the military power

372
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,960
and the Luo Leader Seal.

373
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,400
Your Majesty,

374
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,310
please spare Consort Li's life.

375
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,030
Everything was done by me alone.

376
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,750
Consort Li knew nothing

377
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,510
about it.

378
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,870
Alright.

379
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,240
I promise you.

380
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,480
I will spare Li Fanyin's life.

381
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,590
Fanyin,

382
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,520
in this life,

383
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,440
you belong to me.

Don't kill him!

Your Majesty,

401
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,440
everything is going
according to your plan.

402
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
But now, Lie is deeply in love.

403
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,590
I must push him forward.

404
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,960
I plan to grant marriage for Lie

405
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,830
and Princess Zhaomin
at the Sacrifice Ritual.

406
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,550
Even if they are unwilling,

407
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,480
they won't dare defy
the decree in public.

408
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,850
Your Majesty, how wise of you.

409
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,310
Once General Lie marries Princess Sun,

410
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
the Sun Clan Seal will also be

411
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,030
within our grasp.

412
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,820
(Xuan, Su, Sun)

413
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,350
I've treated him

414
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,440
like a brother since childhood.

415
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,480
We once promised
that whether our enemy

416
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,030
was the army or the swords
and arrows of the world,

417
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,510
we'd fight side by side
and live and die together.

418
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,630
Tell me.

419
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,270
How could it be him?

420
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,720
How could it possibly be him?

421
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,850
Young Master, Dongyin has escaped
from the Heavenly Prison.

422
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,400
Though Dongyin is unforgivable,

423
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,240
she is also a pitiful, lovesick person.

424
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,070
Can you let her go?

425
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,640
She was only your servant,

426
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,280
and in the end,

427
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,160
she could not harm you.

428
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,510
Zhizhou was my friend
for over ten years,

429
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,000
but in the end, he...

430
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,170
Forget it.

431
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,320
Let her go.

432
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,870
Yes.

433
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
Qiluo,

434
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,480
I'm tired. I'll head back first.

435
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,110
Xuan Lie,

436
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,590
take care.

437
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,870
Young Master,

438
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,270
how could Mr. Luo do this?

439
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,780
He and you have always been close,

440
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,710
and he is also the leader
of our Luo Clan.

441
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
Young Master,

442
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,400
what are you planning to do
about Miss Jun?

443
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,720
Now, all the clues point to Miss Jun.

444
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,120
You cannot let emotions
cloud your judgment.

445
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,050
She and I have gone
through dangers together.

446
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,400
If I can't trust her,

447
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,830
how can I face her?

448
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,440
Don't worry, My Lord.

449
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,110
Xi Changkun is dead.

450
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,400
The clues point to Jun Qiluo.

451
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,670
Mother, you've come to find me.

452
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:27,790
Take me home.

453
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,750
Please, take me home.

454
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,090
Mother.

455
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,510
Let go of me. Let me go.

456
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,000
I'll stay in Beixuan a little longer

457
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,550
and watch how things unfold.

458
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,740
(Yuchen Palace)

459
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,440
Your Majesty,

460
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,200
the Forbidden Troops
caught a Beixuan spy.

461
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,110
The spy revealed that Jun Feifan
had joined Beixuan.

462
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,350
His mission

463
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,270
is to escort the Jun family to Beixuan.

464
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,200
Since Jun Feifan dares to betray me,

465
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,750
she must bear the consequences.

466
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,640
Our family is going
through a turbulent time.

467
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,400
Chengliu is suddenly seriously ill.

468
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Feifan

469
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,310
has disappeared.

470
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,110
We cannot be without a head.

471
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,480
We have to have someone in charge.

472
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,480
So, I discussed with the family elders

473
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,130
and decided to hold
the business conference early

474
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,200
to select a new Jun Manager.

475
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,240
Chengsong is right.

476
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,590
Yujue's been managing
the Jinxiu Jewelry Store

477
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,510
without any mistakes.

478
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,030
I propose that Yujue

479
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,440
be appointed as the new Jun Manager.

480
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,780
How does everyone feel about this?

481
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,130
Yujue truly cares for the Jun family.

482
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,030
There is no better candidate than him.

483
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,640
I agree.

484
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,680
I disagree.

485
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,880
Who disagrees?

486
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,440
It's Jiangjuan.

487
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,450
Don't make trouble.

488
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,720
This is a business conference,

489
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,260
not a place where you can speak freely.

490
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,960
Go back home.

491
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,560
Everyone,

492
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,400
the Jun Manager

493
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,720
must not only have business talent

494
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,130
but also be a person of integrity
and righteousness.

495
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,070
And my cousin is certainly

496
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,240
lacking in all three.

497
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,000
Jiangjuan,

498
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,310
what are you trying to say?

499
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,350
Recently, I had the accounts

500
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,960
of my cousin's jewelry store audited.

501
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,880
Everyone, please take a look.

502
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,880
The actual amount in the account

503
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,500
far exceeds what my cousin
has deposited in the family treasury.

504
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,670
Yujue,

505
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,350
as the manager of the jewelry store,

506
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,720
you falsified the accounts.

507
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,800
How can anyone trust him

508
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,030
as the Jun Manager?

509
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,680
No, Father, I...

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,040
Before,

511
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,270
I was in charge
of the jewelry store account,

512
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,680
but I was busy looking
for a physician for Chengliu,

513
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,400
so I left the accounts
to the auditor in the shop.

514
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,550
He must've made an error in the numbers.

515
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,590
Yes, yes.

516
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,790
Sorry for being careless.

517
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,160
I'll go over it carefully later.

518
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,680
If there's any problem,

519
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,750
I will make up the difference.

520
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,510
Everyone, what do you think?

521
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,750
I will definitely

522
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,000
make up that difference.

523
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,510
Thank you, Jiangjuan, for reminding me.

524
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,440
You really are a good sister.

525
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,640
Jun Jiangjuan, as a woman,

526
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,830
you peeked at the accounts.

527
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,360
You violated our family rules.

528
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,880
Since the second branch has promised
to make up the difference,

529
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,550
I think we can let this slide.

530
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,240
I still agree that Yujue
should take the position.

531
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,670
Yes.

532
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,310
The first branch has no one
who is fit for the role now.

533
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,270
- Yes, yes.
- How true.

534
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,720
Who says the first branch
has no one suitable?

535
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,540
(Jun)
This...

536
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,520
Father.

537
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,400
Father, you're awake.

538
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,440
Chengliu.

539
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,710
- Uncle.
- You're finally awake.

540
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,110
Chengliu, you don't know.

541
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,760
Yujue and I have been
worried sick these days.

542
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Chengliu, you just woke up.

543
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,590
You should stay at home to rest.

544
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,590
You don't need to worry
about the conference.

545
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,590
I'll take you back.

546
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,480
We'll take you back.

547
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,830
- If I don't worry,
- Let go.

548
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,800
the family business

549
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,070
will eventually be ruined by you two.

550
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,440
- No...
- Chengliu, what are you saying?

551
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,230
- I...
- Father, don't get worked up.

552
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Take care of your health.

553
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,550
Uncle Ling.

554
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,510
Respected elders

555
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,960
and managers,

556
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,920
I've come here today despite my illness

557
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,550
to ask you one thing.

558
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,760
Do you think I'm already dead

559
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,760
so you're supporting
the second branch in taking charge?

560
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,160
Uncle,

561
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,670
what you say

562
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,840
is truly hurtful to us.

563
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,150
Do you know?

564
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,280
It was only when we
saw you unconscious that...

565
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,550
I've woken up now.
Can I still take charge?

566
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,640
Come back.

567
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,000
Twelve years ago,

568
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,030
Chengsong gambled
the family's business away.

569
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
It was Feifan and I

570
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,070
who managed to save the family.

571
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,320
When the shops were struggling,

572
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:48,000
it was Feifan who found a new way
and moved the obstacles,

573
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,400
leading the family to where we are now.

574
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,480
Chengliu,

575
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,260
this is all past.

576
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,550
Why are you bringing it up again?

577
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,400
Yes, look.

578
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,630
Now your health...

579
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,550
I know my own health.

580
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,920
Before Feifan comes back,

581
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,440
I will temporarily take charge.

582
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,200
Does anyone have any objections?

583
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,160
I...

584
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,560
The Gold Embroidery has no objections

585
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,480
about Mr. Chengliu taking charge.

586
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,110
That's right, we have no objections.

587
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,760
We have no objections either.

588
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,920
It's good for Mr. Chengliu

589
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,510
to come back and take charge.

590
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,640
Good.

591
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,670
Since there are no objections,

592
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,800
we'll go with it for now.

593
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Congrats, Master.

594
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
Father, you haven't fully recovered.

595
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,200
Let me push you back.

596
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,200
Alright.

597
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,800
The King's decree.

598
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,280
Here's the King's order:

599
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,550
Jun Feifan is secretly in league
with foreign enemies,

600
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,480
plotting rebellion.

601
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,670
Now, the Jun family's first branch

602
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,360
shall be arrested and imprisoned,

603
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,760
awaiting judgment.

604
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,280
Impossible.

605
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,030
How could Feifan betray the country?

606
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,550
This is really interesting.

607
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,110
It all came so easily.

608
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,110
It's fate.

609
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,260
Your Majesty,

610
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,710
the Juns have been imprisoned.

611
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,630
Jun Chengliu begs to see you
in the Heavenly Prison.

612
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,030
He said Jun Feifan
would never betray the country.

613
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,280
Jun Feifan has been
in Beixuan for so long.

614
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,280
No one knows what she has done.

615
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,800
How would Jun Chengliu know

616
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,550
whether she has betrayed Yannan?

617
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,280
Your Majesty, are you saying...?

618
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,800
I want to see

619
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,630
whether Jun Feifan
will still stay in Beixuan

620
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,590
if her father and sisters
die because of her.

621
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:26,660
(Spirit Tablet of Sun Ba, Late Husband)

622
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,550
I never imagined

623
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,630
that the one who killed my father
was Mr. Luo.

624
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,760
Zhaomin,

625
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,710
your father must have hoped

626
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,800
that you and Mrs. Sun
would soon buck up.

627
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,240
I understand.

628
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,480
My father's greatest wish in life

629
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,960
was for the people of Liangzhou

630
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,920
to live in peace and prosperity.

631
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,630
I will become the Sun Leader

632
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,550
and fulfill his wish.

633
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,360
You can do it.

634
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,200
By the way,

635
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,530
the Sacrifice Ritual is about to begin.

636
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,740
Qiluo, come with me.

637
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,230
I am just a Yannan merchant.

638
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,110
How could I enter
Beixuan Royal Palace?

639
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,760
Don't worry. I have a way.

640
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,510
It's the auspicious time.
Light the Sacrifice Fire.

641
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,800
Welcome the Wolf Lord.

642
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,620
(Eastern Affairs)

643
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,800
Welcome, Wolf Lord.

644
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,230
He is truly handsome.

645
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,880
Welcome, Wolf Lord.

646
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,320
Welcome, Wolf Lord.

647
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,110
Xuan Lie, as the Xuan Leader,

648
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,140
is talented in civil
and military affairs.

649
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,630
Destined by the heavens,

650
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,280
it shall be announced to the world

651
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,800
that he shall be granted the title

652
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,920
(Xuanwu Palace)
of the Five Clans' Wolf Lord,

653
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,150
taking the Five Clans' military power.

654
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,800
Today, I officially grant you
the title of Wolf Lord of Beixuan.

655
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,110
May you remember the royal favor

656
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,190
and help me protect Beixuan forever.

657
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,720
Your Majesty,

658
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,760
I will not fail your trust.

659
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,070
Your father always hoped
for the unity of the Five Clans.

660
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,960
Now that you've become the Wolf Lord,

661
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,150
your father must be very pleased

662
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,070
from the heavens.

663
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,360
I will never forget

664
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,230
my father's wishes.

665
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,280
The military token
of the Five Clans is granted.

666
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,670
The King is wise and virtuous.
Congrats to the Wolf Lord.

667
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,000
The King is wise and virtuous.
Congrats to the Wolf Lord.

668
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,920
The King is wise and virtuous.
Congrats to the Wolf Lord.

669
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,550
On this auspicious day,

670
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I have another happy news to announce.

671
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,190
By royal command,
a marriage shall proceed.

672
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,670
The Wolf Lord Xuan Lie

673
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,320
with filial piety,
excels in civil and military affairs.

674
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,880
The Princess of the Sun Clan

675
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,690
is young, graceful, pretty, noble,

676
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,360
wise and talented.

677
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,190
Their marriage shall be granted.

678
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,670
They'll become a couple

679
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,130
to ensure the nation's prosperity.

680
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,480
They shall get married
on an auspicious day.

681
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:27,990
Zhaomin.

682
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,030
Zhaomin.

683
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,160
Zhaomin.

684
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,760
I know you can't stop thinking
about her,

685
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,230
but that won't affect
your marriage alliance.

686
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,840
Otherwise, even if she is
the Baigong's heir,

687
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,840
she still can't live.

688
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,590
The Wolf Lord must be overjoyed.

689
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,110
Princess Zhaomin
is elegant and graceful.

690
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,030
Lie, accept the decree.

691
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,440
Accept the decree.

692
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,760
Thank you for your royal kindness.

693
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,550
Your Majesty,

694
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,190
