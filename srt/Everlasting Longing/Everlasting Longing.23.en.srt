Please wait.

19
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,480
I want to see your master.

20
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,150
Could you announce me, please?

21
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,590
Hold on a moment.

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,150
Qiluo, are you all right?

23
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,430
I'm fine.

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
Qiluo.

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
My Lady.

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
What's wrong?

27
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,710
Sir, how is my sister?

28
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,710
Nothing serious.

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
She caught a cold, affecting the pregnancy.

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,190
Resting for a few days will help.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,560
Pregnancy?

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,840
Are you sure?

33
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,910
The pregnancy is two months along.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,120
I'll prescribe some medicine.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,750
Have her take it three times daily.

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,750
What's going on?

37
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,030
Who is the father?

38
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,470
Wait until she wakes up

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,910
and let her tell you herself.

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,530
I'm seeing the physician out.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,630
Qimin is a man of few words.

42
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,960
We can't get anything out of him.

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Qiluo has been hiding this from us.

44
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,910
She likely didn't want us to be concerned.

45
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,030
Qimin knows her better than anyone,

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,560
but he doesn't know

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
whether to keep covering for her.

48
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,080
Don't put him in a tough spot.

49
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,240
Two months pregnant.

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,840
She must've been through a lot.

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
What did you say?

52
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,840
Jun Qiluo is unmarried,

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,910
yet two months pregnant?

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,590
Lower your voice. Get out.

55
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,800
How could you ignore propriety and intrude?

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
Your sister is unvirtuous

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,630
and has done something disgraceful.

58
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,150
Propriety, you say?

59
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,680
If this gets out,

60
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,120
it'll ruin my reputation

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,520
and the honor of the Zheng family.

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Who are you calling unvirtuous?

63
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,710
How dare you?

64
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,960
Shame on you.

65
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,800
I want to call it off.

66
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,470
Xiukun.

67
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,430
Do you think Qiluo is ashamed?

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
Of course not.

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,560
Qiluo has never

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,070
lived for herself.

71
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Although I don't know what happened,

72
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,920
I think

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,600
it's her silent rebellion.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,480
It's as if she wants to
live for herself once.

75
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,270
I will support whatever she decides.

76
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,360
But the Zheng family...

77
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,360
Qiluo has done so much

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,120
for our family.

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,830
How can I be selfish?

80
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,040
If they cancel the engagement,

81
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,630
I won't make it hard for him.

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
You fools.

83
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,360
I've told you

84
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,270
to keep an eye

85
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,160
on Jun Qiluo!

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,310
You losers.

87
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,510
You achieve nothing for a reason.

88
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,040
Send some men

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,750
to teach that shop owner a lesson.

90
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,830
Make sure they rough him up so bad

91
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,870
that he won't even recognize himself.

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
Since last night,

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
many guards have surrounded the house.

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,720
Our people couldn't act all night.

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
Otherwise, how could we

96
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,830
have let Miss Jun act so quickly?

97
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,480
Send more people

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
to keep an eye on Pear Alley.

99
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,800
The moment

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,190
Jun Qiluo makes any move,

101
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,360
report immediately!

102
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
- Yes.
- Get lost!

103
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,670
Go.

104
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,510
Jun Qiluo,

105
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,720
I won't give you any chance.

106
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,660
(Savory Tavern)

107
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,720
Mr. Zheng, why the long face?

108
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,310
Miss Jun's a goner,

109
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,120
but there are other women out there.

110
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,870
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

111
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,360
- Exactly.
- Mr. Li, you're mistaken.

112
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,430
It's not about her.

113
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,430
What's troubling me is

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
which lady

115
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,040
I should pick next.

116
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,160
Impressive, Mr. Zheng.

117
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,310
Zheng Shuting.

118
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,720
My sister still cries for you.

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,600
Yet you're seeking new love.

120
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,870
- What?
- I have no ties with your family.

121
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Stay out of it.

122
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,310
Spending our money
on drinks and studies,

123
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,360
pretending to be from a noble family,

124
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,630
and yet you abandon her
when she needs you the most.

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,040
You're a fraud.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
You...

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,950
- Mr. Zheng.
- What a fraud!

128
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,040
- Stop!
- What's going on?

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,950
What's this in broad daylight?

130
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
You...

131
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,160
They put up a fight.

132
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,590
Well done.

133
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,800
- Well done.
- Indeed.

134
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,800
Serves him right.

135
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
He deserved it.

136
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,510
Someone like him

137
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,910
can be a fraud?

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,840
He deserves it.

139
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm warning you.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,950
The Juns gave you some dowry money

141
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,360
to help your family.

142
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,600
If you're calling it off,

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,360
return the money,

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,160
or I'll report you to the officials.

145
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,190
How ridiculous.

146
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,670
Serves you right.

147
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,310
Apple of Sodom.

148
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,240
- Right.
- I was drunk

149
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,830
and said some foolish things for pride.

150
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,680
I want to marry Xiukun.

151
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,870
I was upset and confused

152
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,240
and didn't know how to react.

153
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,510
I'll go apologize tomorrow.

154
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
I don't know why Xiukun likes you.

155
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,790
Young Master,

156
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,040
this is from the Yannan spies.

157
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,310
This is a portrait of Jun Feifan.

158
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,920
Jun Feifan?

159
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,310
The one in the portrait.

160
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,880
You scoundrel.

161
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
- Why are you following me?
- No, I'm not.

162
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,600
Why are you following me?

163
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,950
I'm no scoundrel.

164
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,120
Didn't I just help you?

165
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,710
Moreover,

166
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,950
do I look like a scoundrel?

167
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,600
Just admit it.

168
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
Your grin is creepy.

169
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm warning you.

170
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,960
Keep following me,

171
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,070
and I'll give you a problem.

172
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,750
Where is Young Master?

173
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,420
(Jun Mansion)

174
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,590
Miss Jiangjuan,

175
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,040
the shop is rented.

176
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,910
I saw the owner sign it myself.

177
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,390
Great.

178
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,150
Qiluo's efforts paid off.

179
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,990
Come on.

180
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,110
Qiluo.

181
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,870
You're awake.

182
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
I heard someone picked on you.

183
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,840
No one picked on me.

184
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,510
Qiluo, the shop's signed.

185
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,630
Qimin supervised the signing.

186
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Qiluo,

187
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,510
you must've endured so much.

188
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,080
You knew about it?

189
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,320
The father...

190
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,910
It's a long story.

191
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,840
I'll find time to tell you.

192
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,960
What worries me now

193
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,550
is the news of my pregnancy spreading.

194
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,960
It might affect your reputation.

195
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,120
That's why I didn't tell you earlier.

196
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,240
Qiluo, don't worry.

197
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
Reputation doesn't matter.

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,770
Your health is more important.

Qiluo.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
You're still alive.

219
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,790
You are not dead.

220
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,790
Why are you here?

221
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I wanted to see where you lived.

222
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,630
I never thought I'd see you again.

223
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,320
Xuan Lie,

224
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,280
I told you

225
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
we shall never meet again.

226
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,390
Why didn't you tell me you were alive?

227
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,960
If I hadn't come to Yannan,

228
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,240
were you keeping it from me forever?

229
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,720
You shouldn't have come.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,630
Since you're married,

231
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,600
you should be faithful to Zhaomin.

232
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,120
I didn't marry Zhaomin.

233
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,390
Zhaomin and I had a plan...

234
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,550
It doesn't matter now.

235
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,600
The moment I jumped off that cliff,

236
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,840
we were finished.

237
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,720
Your affairs are not my concern.

238
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,910
How can it not matter?

239
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,320
Do all the things happened between us

240
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,910
mean nothing?

241
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Xuan Lie,

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,630
don't act like you're that important.

243
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,320
Qiluo,

244
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,120
was this all your plan?

245
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
You made me watch you jump off the cliff,

246
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,270
think you were dead,

247
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,840
and live in pain ever since?

248
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,960
Yes.

249
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,750
Because only if I'm gone,

250
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,840
can you truly let go.

251
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,270
Do you know how risky it was?

252
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,150
If you had failed, you'd be gone.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,030
Then I accept my fate.

254
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,910
I'd rather die

255
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,240
than have anything to do with you.

256
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,270
You'd rather die

257
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,670
than be with me?

258
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,080
Xuan Lie, it's you again.

259
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,480
Are you her accomplice?

260
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,750
Who are you to question me?

261
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,030
She almost died in Beixuan
because of you.

262
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,310
- Even the Jun's...
- Qimin,

263
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
say no more to him.

264
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,030
Just ask him to leave.

265
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,390
Qiluo,

266
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,750
do you have nothing to say to me?

267
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,910
Leave Yannan.

268
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,440
We'll never meet again.

269
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,080
Xuan Lie,

270
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,600
you heard her.

271
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,630
She has no ties with you anymore.

272
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,270
If you disturb us again,

273
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,360
the King will know

274
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,120
the Wolf Lord sneaks into Yannan,

275
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,360
and there's no real peace talk.

276
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,470
All right.

277
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,790
As you wish.

278
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,870
My Lady.

279
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,510
I know what you want to say.

280
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,240
Don't worry.

281
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,200
His presence won't change anything.

282
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,270
I'm not worried about Xuan Lie

283
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,600
but the safety of the whole Jun family.

284
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,550
You know the King suspects your loyalty.

285
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,680
If he finds out

286
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,870
the Wolf Lord snuck here
to meet with you.

287
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,510
Even if one person spills,

288
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,150
it will confirm the Jun family's treason.

289
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,150
And the Master is still in his hands.

290
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,720
Tomorrow, I will tell my sisters

291
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,150
about our upcoming marriage.

292
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
Let them start the preparations.

293
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,440
It's only if we get married

294
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,200
that Xuan Lie's arrival

295
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,440
won't bring danger to the Jun family.

296
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,160
How is that possible?

297
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,310
You said Miss Jun is alive?

298
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,440
Is she doing well?

299
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,160
She fell from such a high cliff.

300
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,270
Is she injured?

301
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,880
She's perfectly fine.

302
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,480
That's wonderful news.

303
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,870
Young Master,

304
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,480
you came to Yannan missing Miss Jun,

305
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,960
and now she's safe and sound.

306
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,000
You can stay in Yannan

307
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,270
and reunite with her, right?

308
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,440
Who says I want to stay?

309
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,820
You...

310
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,160
Since she'd rather die than stay,

311
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,110
let her have her wish.

312
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,550
Leave for Beixuan tomorrow.

313
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,150
No.

314
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,550
We've been traveling for so long.

315
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,880
Are we returning tomorrow?

316
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,940
(Intoxicated Pavilion)

317
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,800
Oh, no.

318
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,590
Miss Jun surely hasn't forgiven him.

319
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,670
Young Master.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,880
What?

321
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,110
You're marrying Qimin?

322
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,680
Qimin is quite nice.

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,030
If I must marry,

324
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,880
he's the best choice.

325
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,440
Qiluo is right.

326
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Qimin grew up in our family.

327
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,790
He's loyal to Qiluo.

328
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,640
Father is also very pleased with him.

329
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,550
Besides, Qiluo is now expecting.

330
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,640
If she marries Qimin,

331
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200
it will silence all the gossip.

332
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,790
Let's see who dares to speak ill.

333
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,510
I'd be the first to teach them a lesson.

334
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
But, Qiluo,

335
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,920
why did you suddenly decide to marry?

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's okay, Qiluo.

337
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
I'll support you in whatever you do.

338
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,270
When is the wedding set?

339
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,750
I want to make you

340
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,830
the finest wedding attire
in the Royal Capital.

341
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,920
We just rented a shop now,

342
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,510
still short on money for stock.

343
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,160
I'll reach out to previous partners

344
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,270
and discuss it further.

345
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,480
Once everything's settled, we can marry.

346
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,640
Without your Jun Feifan alias

347
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,590
and with our cousin causing trouble,

348
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,880
will they agree?

349
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,390
Rest assured.

350
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,350
Jun Feifan supported the family business

351
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,480
and Jun Qiluo can do the same now.

352
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,960
I'll reclaim everything we lost

353
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,070
one by one.

354
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,760
Miss Qiluo.

355
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,750
Mr. Zheng's here.

356
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,720
He came to apologize to Miss Xiukun.

357
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,110
Xiukun is likely to forgive Zheng Shuting.

358
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,070
I wonder what Xiukun sees in him.

359
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,400
Yesterday, he was boasting

360
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,310
to his rowdy friends,

361
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,960
saying he was troubled
about which lady to pick next.

362
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,350
So I gave him a lesson.

363
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,670
Qiluo,

364
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,400
do you think Xiukun will
be happy marrying him?

365
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,480
It's Xiukun's marriage.

366
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's let her decide for herself.

367
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,200
We'll wait and see.

368
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
Xiukun,

369
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,400
I passed by Fragrant Delights today

370
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,270
and bought your favorite pastries.

371
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,750
Aren't you calling it off?

372
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why bother?

373
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,150
Xiukun,

374
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,590
I spoke in anger that day.

375
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,960
Please don't take it to heart.

376
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,550
We're well-matched in affection.

377
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,920
How could I cancel it?

378
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,590
You know my family values education

379
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,550
and reputation.

380
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,830
When I heard your sister was expecting,

381
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,920
I was in a panic

382
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,000
and spoke without thinking.

383
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,510
After reflecting on it,

384
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,270
I realized you are different
from your sisters.

385
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,830
You're gentle and understanding.

386
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,640
I shouldn't blame you for her matter.

387
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
Qiluo has given the most for our family.

388
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,880
You can't bad-mouth her.

389
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,350
All right. I won't.

390
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,000
Please

391
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,440
don't be mad at me.

392
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,000
Young Master, we must leave the city soon.

393
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,750
Since we're returning to Beixuan,

394
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,160
we need to hurry.

395
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,240
The two states are negotiating now.

396
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,680
If our identity is discovered,

397
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,670
we'll be in trouble.

398
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,720
- Have a look.
- All right.

399
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,160
(Makeup)
Makeup. Take a look.

400
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,030
I'll wrap it for you.

401
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,350
Young Master,

402
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,510
if you don't want to leave,

403
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,590
we can stay a few more days.

404
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,200
I'll get some specialties for He Jiyao.

405
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,800
Does He Jiyao

406
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,630
use this?

407
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,030
(Makeup)
Oiled paper umbrella.

408
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,350
Candied hawthorns.

409
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,670
For Qingkou.

410
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,510
That's right, Princess Qingkou.

411
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,590
Yes.

412
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Young Master.

413
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,960
Is that Miss Jun?

414
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,160
Should we follow her?

415
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,340
(Graceful Jewel)

416
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,720
Landscape painting.

417
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
Go if you want to.

418
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,350
Go.

419
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,430
So obstinate.

420
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,430
Manager Wang.

421
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You are...

422
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,750
I'm Jun Feifan's sister, Jun Qiluo.

423
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,000
I've heard Miss Jun has returned.

424
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,590
What brings you here, Miss Qiluo?

425
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,510
Do you have time now?

426
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,680
Let's have a chat.

427
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes, feel free to speak.

428
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,070
I'm here to propose a business opportunity.

429
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,880
You might've already heard

430
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,240
we're restarting the textile business.

431
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,640
We've rented a new shop by the street.

432
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,510
The Palace will select fabrics soon,

433
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,160
and we've created new fabrics for it.

434
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,790
We'll surely secure that order.

435
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,110
Miss Qiluo,

436
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,270
Feifan was nice to me when he was alive.

437
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,440
I remember it well.

438
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,070
You are his sister.

439
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,270
If it's something else, I'll certainly help.

440
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
But for collaboration,

441
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,550
I think I'll pass.

442
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,110
I understand.

443
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,880
Jun Yujue has informed you, right?

444
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,110
Since you already know,

445
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,270
I'll be straightforward.

446
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,590
Jun family has the top business in Yannan.

447
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,750
Who would risk angering them for you?

448
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,920
I think you'd better

449
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,960
just give up.

450
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,920
Don't pick fights you can't win.

451
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,520
Manager Wang,

452
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,400
if you don't try,

453
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,030
how do you know who is stronger?

454
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,230
These jewels of yours,

455
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,070
are they from Jinxiu Jewelry Store?

456
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,200
Was the price fair?

457
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,960
The quality was decent, right?

458
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,550
Without Feifan's help,

459
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,790
my shop would've closed.

460
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,480
Since Jun Yujue took over,

461
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,160
prices have been raised a lot.

462
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,790
The quality is off too.

463
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,110
Since Jun Yujue took charge,

464
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,110
prices have gone up.

465
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,550
I own a small business

466
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,270
and wouldn't dare offend him.

467
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,670
Look,

468
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,920
recently, I signed an order

469
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,680
of white jade with Mr. Shi
from Aolong Fort.

470
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,720
If you're interested,

471
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,200
I could transfer it to you.

472
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,640
Seriously?

473
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,030
Such good things are for insiders only.

474
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
So, I need you to be my partner.

475
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,750
How can I know

476
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,350
if you're telling the truth?

477
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,240
Fine texture, glossy and smooth.

478
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,960
It's the white jade from Aolong Fort.

479
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,900
(Contract)

480
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,880
It truly is a white jade contract.

481
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,870
So?

482
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,590
But...

483
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,960
No more buts.

484
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,510
I've drafted our contract.

485
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,480
If you sign,

486
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,310
all the white jade will be yours.

487
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,440
Pay 200 strings of coins,

488
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,270
you'll get 20% of the future profits.

489
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,790
- I...
- Don't worry.

490
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,240
Working with me

491
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,880
will surely bring you profit.

492
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,480
All right.

493
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,800
Young Master,

494
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,110
Jun's business

495
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,200
is taken by someone named Jue.

496
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,590
Miss Jun is raising money

497
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,440
to open a new shop.

498
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,480
Go check on

499
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,510
Jun's first branch.

500
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,640
Are we returning today?

501
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,510
No, we're not.

502
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,680
I'm on it.

503
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,420
(Jun)

504
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,750
How grand!

505
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,440
Sir, may I help you?

506
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,590
Let me show you around.

507
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
Where's your manager Jun Feifan?

508
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,030
You're not a local, right?

509
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,750
How can you tell?

510
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,830
Jun Feifan died while trading
in the Uncontrollable.

511
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,200
The whole Royal Capital knows.

512
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,480
Look.

513
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,590
I,

514
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,070
Jun Yujue,

515
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,480
is now the Jun Manager.

516
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,440
Jun Yujue.

517
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,920
So, you're the scoundrel.

518
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,510
Have you heard of me?

519
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,070
No, I haven't.

520
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,550
But I know what you've done to Miss Jun.

521
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,110
Who are you?

522
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,950
What's it for?

523
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Doesn't matter who I am.

524
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,070
You picked on Miss Jun.

525
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
I'm going to teach you a lesson

526
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,790
to let you know
who you can't mess with.

527
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,000
Let go, or I'll...

528
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,480
What happened here?

529
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,150
It hurts.

530
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,560
Stop yelling.

531
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,030
Listen up.

532
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
Stay away from Miss Jun.

533
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,030
Return this shop to her.

534
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,200
Or I'll beat you up every day.

535
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,430
It's him.

536
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,240
- Get up.
- Not me.

537
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,510
- Move.
- What are you doing?

538
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,270
Young Master.

539
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,310
Easy. My wrist.

540
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,590
Go get him.

541
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,310
Officers,

542
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,550
take him.

543
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,590
- We got him.
- Teach him a lesson.

544
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,570
- Move.
- Don't take me.

545
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,720
- Get lost.
- Wait.

546
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,840
Let go.

547
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,700
Get lost.

548
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,260
(Intoxicated Pavilion)

549
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,920
Why are you here?

550
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,270
I meant not to disturb you.

551
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,440
But Luo Qi was arrested by the authorities.

552
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,000
Then go to the authorities.

553
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Why come here?

554
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
I hold a unique position.

555
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,110
Could you bail him out?

556
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,630
Qiluo,

557
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,750
did Manager Wang agree to cooperate?

558
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,270
I knew you'd succeed.

559
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,160
This is...

560
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,520
A stranger.

561
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,270
Qiluo,

562
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,680
shall we purchase looms and silk tomorrow?

563
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,750
We're a bit short on funds.

564
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,790
I'll find a way.

565
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,160
Hire a few more workers.

566
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,070
We'll need more hands.

567
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,320
By the way,

568
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,510
help me bail someone out.

569
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,270
Who is it?

570
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,030
His name is Luo Qi.

571
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,240
Find out his offense.

572
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,240
Pay whatever it takes to free him.

573
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,480
Luo Qi?

574
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,110
Is he a friend of yours?

575
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,460
No.

576
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,720
But he once helped me.

577
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,400
He is

578
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,350
a nice person.

579
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,160
Rest assured.

580
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,960
I will handle this matter properly.

581
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

582
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,830
No need to rise.

583
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,960
Thank you.

584
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,750
Since Jun Qiluo has improved
the Three-Arrow Crossbow,

585
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,310
I should pardon the Jun family.

586
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,590
But she has been in Beixuan for long,

587
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,400
making me concerned.

588
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,720
Qiluo went to find the black iron crystal

589
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,750
with no other intentions.

590
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,720
Please understand.

591
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,400
I know this well.

592
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,720
I trust her.

593
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,550
I just feel

594
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,510
that she's of marriageable age,

595
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,310
yet still wandering.

596
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,110
You're not a very responsible father.

597
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,350
Indeed.

598
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,350
Well,

599
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,830
I decided

600
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,070
to betroth her to the Jun's guard,

601
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,310
Shao Qimin.

602
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,070
They grew up knowing each other

603
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,640
and are quite familiar.

604
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,440
They'd make a nice couple, right?

605
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,310
Once married,

606
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,270
she'll stay in the Royal Capital

607
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,880
and won't think about leaving.

608
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,960
What do you say?

609
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,640
Thank you for your grace.

610
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,440
They have been close since childhood.

611
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,000
I also wish to see them married.

612
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,200
This way,

613
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,720
it fulfills one of my wishes.

614
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,040
Very well.

615
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,960
Their wedding day is approaching.

616
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,400
I won't keep you in the palace.

617
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,790
Thank you.

618
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,070
Farewell, Your Majesty.

619
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,880
He's the one you're looking for.

620
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,350
(It's him?)

621
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,240
May I ask what his crime is?

622
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,070
His crime isn't severe,

623
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,910
but it's not trivial.

624
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,590
He hit the manager of Brocade Embroidery.

625
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,590
Jun Yujue?

626
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,030
(He did something good for once.)

627
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,640
(But you were so blind)

628
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,590
(to mess with me.)

629
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,070
(So let's see you suffer a bit.)

630
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,400
He's been flogged 30 times.

631
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,000
If you want to bail him out,

632
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,270
sign and take him away.

633
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,720
Sir,

634
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,160
I'll give you another hundred coins.

635
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,730
Can you keep him for another three days?

636
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,350
The Royal Capital is not lawless.

637
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
If everyone

638
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
follows his conduct,

639
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,350
wouldn't that trouble

640
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,640
the patrolling officers?

641
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,240
The prison won't be big enough.

642
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,110
Better charge him with disturbing peace

643
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,960
and detain him for three days.

644
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,830
Uh...

645
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,830
For the cell.

646
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,920
You have a point.

647
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,030
I'll inform the jailer.

648
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,680
Make sure Luo Qi doesn't hear of this.

649
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,870
Understood.

650
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,110
Why are you laughing?

651
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,720
Truly a hothead, aren't you?

652
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,590
Haven't you learned from my lesson?

653
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,830
Yet you dare to fight again.

654
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,160
I did it all for Miss Jun.

655
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,590
I heard from Qiluo that you helped her.

656
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,030
How did you meet?

657
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,640
It's a long story.

658
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
But if I'm not mistaken,

659
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,750
you're Jun Jiangjuan, right?

660
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,890
Did Miss Jun send you to bail me out?

661
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,840
Indeed.

662
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,110
Rest assured.

663
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,920
I've got it all sorted for you.

664
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,920
Just stay here for three days,

665
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,760
then you're free.

666
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,070
I...

667
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,310
I've taken the punishment.

668
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,880
Why three more days?

669
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,550
Assault is a serious crime.

670
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,390
If I...

671
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,550
If I hadn't bribed them,

672
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,030
you'd be facing execution and exile.

673
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,440
Instead of thanking me, you complain.

674
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,790
My kindness was wasted.

675
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,870
In Yannan,

676
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,720
is it that strict even if I cause no harm?

677
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,640
I must be really lucky

678
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,030
to meet someone as kind as you.

679
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,270
The food here is poor,

680
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,780
so I brought you some compote.

681
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,750
See if you like it.

682
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,160
What are your plans once you're out?

683
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,720
Can you read?

684
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,790
It's fine if you can't.

685
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,400
You can do manual labor, right?

686
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,510
I can.

687
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm strong.

688
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,790
I can do hard work.

689
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,750
I can read.

690
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,310
I love reading novels.

691
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Novels?

692
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,270
I love novels too.

693
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,790
If you have nowhere to go,

694
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,960
why not come to my place?

695
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,750
We can read together.

696
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,320
So...

697
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,560
Miss,

698
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,480
you mean...

699
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,510
My family is short-staffed.

700
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,790
If you work for us,

701
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,400
I promise no discrimination.

702
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,750
We'll pay 10 coins monthly.

703
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,510
(Young Master appears indifferent,)

704
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,350
(but he surely wants to win her back.)

705
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,400
(If I can get into the Jun family,)

706
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,960
(I'll keep him informed.)

707
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,680
(That's extra credit.)

708
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,160
You mean he knows Jun Qiluo?

709
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,440
He kept saying he wanted

710
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,350
to teach me a lesson for Miss Jun.

711
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,680
Who else could Miss Jun be but Jun Qiluo?

712
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,110
She's not Jun Feifan anymore.

713
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,240
(Abundance)
Why so arrogant?

714
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,080
A shrew!

715
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,510
Watch it.

716
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,110
Do you want all of Yannan to know

717
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,790
that Jun Qiluo is Jun Feifan?

718
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,840
But I was...

719
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,800
Master.

720
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,350
Master.

721
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,590
Jun Qiluo has convinced several managers

722
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,750
to join her in business.

723
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,590
What?

724
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,790
Leave now.

725
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,630
Yes.

726
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,750
It seems Jun Qiluo

727
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,160
is a tough opponent.

728
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,750
It's just a small shop.

729
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,030
Compared to ours,

730
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,480
it's nothing.

731
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,750
Yujue, don't forget

732
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,590
she once made our shops

733
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,480
into the top business in Yannan.

734
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,830
Father, you're overthinking.

735
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,030
See for yourself.

736
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,240
Do you see?

737
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,030
Now the entire Royal Capital

738
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,760
belongs to the Jun family.

739
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,870
Moreover,

740
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,190
I've told all the managers

741
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,590
that no one is allowed
to do business with Jun Qiluo.

742
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,710
Even if she opens a shop,

743
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,840
how can she run it without orders?

744
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,710
You're such a visionary.

745
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,440
Just one incense stick of time.

746
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,480
Miss Jiangjuan is

747
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,150
so kind and beautiful.

748
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,150
Yet I use her kindness to enter the Jun family.

749
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,550
Once I'm there,

750
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,480
I'll work diligently.

751
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,280
I won't let her down.

752
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,630
Young Master.

753
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,630
I knew you'd come to save me.

754
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,760
Enough.

755
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,920
Are you hurt?

756
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm fine now.

757
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,990
By the way,

758
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,550
what did you say

759
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,600
about Miss Jiangjuan?

760
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,280
Miss Jun sent her to bail me out.

761
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,920
She said being in prison

762
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,000
would give me a record.

763
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,320
It's hard to get a job in Yannan.

764
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,800
But she didn't mind me

765
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
and asked me to work for the Juns.

766
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,310
She said 10 coins a month
with food and board.

767
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,000
She cares about me after all.

768
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,990
You agreed?

769
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,150
Of course.

770
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,760
You've been so down because of Miss Jun.

771
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,030
If I can get into the Jun family,

772
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,920
I'll keep you informed.

773
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,190
Wouldn't that help you

774
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,190
and Miss Jun reconcile sooner?

775
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,840
I didn't say that.

776
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,350
All right.

777
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,280
Seeing you're safe, I'm relieved.

778
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,000
However, it seems

779
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,150
we'll stay longer in Yannan.

780
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,760
Reflect well here

781
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,630
until Miss Jiangjuan takes you back.

782
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,990
Young Master.

783
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,630
I'll keep you informed.

784
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,380
(Jun Mansion)

785
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,000
What happened to Jun's first branch?

786
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,110
Quite tragic.

787
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,760
Mr. Jun injured his leg recently.

788
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,480
The whole family was imprisoned

789
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,920
and sentenced to death by the King.

790
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,960
Their property was taken
by the second branch.

791
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,150
But somehow,

792
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,470
the eldest daughter

793
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,320
has returned.

794
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
The other two daughters have also resurfaced.

795
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,630
They are planning to open a shop.

796
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,920
But the second branch makes things difficult.

797
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,840
It won't be easy for them

798
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,110
to run a business.

799
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,430
Qiluo,

800
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,400
I heard a Xixiang merchant

801
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,150
will order 150,000 bolts of silk.

802
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,440
Where did you get that?

803
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,440
It's spreading all over.

804
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,710
All the managers in the business

805
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,800
are discussing it.

806
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,760
Our shop is just starting out.

807
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,400
If we can secure this order,

808
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,030
we'll quickly establish it here.

809
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,800
But our shop is quite small,

810
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,360
even if we can get the order,
we can't fulfill it.

811
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,880
Moreover, our cousin

812
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,000
will surely covet this order.

813
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,840
We have no advantage.

814
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,220
(Prospering Righteously)

815
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,670
For such a big order,

816
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,360
who else can handle it

817
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,840
besides us

818
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,510
in the Royal Capital?

819
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,070
Yujue,

820
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,150
if we can land this order,

821
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,110
we're set for the next six months.

822
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,760
Our capability speaks for itself.

823
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,000
We're just too good.

824
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,630
We can't stay humble.

825
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,260
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)
He's said to see no guests.

826
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,920
In two days, all merchants

827
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,360
will go to the Savory Tavern with offers.

828
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Keep an eye on it.

829
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,550
Make sure to secure this deal.

830
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
Chancellor,

831
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,920
our biggest rival now

832
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,280
is the Jun family.

833
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,920
But without Jun Feifan,

834
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,230
Jun Yujue is

835
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,630
definitely not a threat.

836
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,920
When will you acquire the Juns' business?

837
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,440
Everything is ready.

838
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,030
Just wait for the final push.

839
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,350
My Lady,

840
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,760
we won the bid.

841
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,900
The Xixiang caravan wants to
meet here for talks.

842
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,840
(Achieve Excellence)

843
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,680
Xuan Lie?

844
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,840
What brings you here?

845
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,320
To talk business.

846
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,840
The merchant ordering 150,000 bolts of silk

847
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
was you?

848
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,670
You're the...

849
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,000
Were you pretending to be

850
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,000
a merchant intentionally?

851
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,150
Do you think it was for you?

852
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,840
If that's not the case,

853
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,880
are you really ordering 150,000 bolts?

854
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,510
Our textile isn't as developed as yours.

855
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,550
Since I'm here,

856
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,960
I can't return empty-handed.

857
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,710
Even if I was helping you

858
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,110
because you're in a tough spot,

859
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,000
you wouldn't

860
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,920
appreciate it anyway.

861
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,630
Among the three quotes,

862
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,190
yours is the lowest.

863
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,200
That's why I consider working with you.

864
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,000
If you don't want this order,

865
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,710
- then I will...
- Whatever your aim is,

866
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,510
I really need this order.

867
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,550
To work with you,

868
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,190
I need to know your requirements.

869
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,320
No requirements.

870
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,160
I trust you.

871
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,070
Chancellor,

872
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,110
Jun Qiluo got the order anyway.

873
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,230
Her small shop

874
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,840
dared to take such a big order?

875
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,670
I thought we had it,

876
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,070
undercutting Jun Yujue

877
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,510
by 10 coins.

878
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,960
Didn't expect Jun Qiluo to compete too.

879
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,550
Her price might be even lower than ours.

880
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,840
That's peculiar.

881
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,480
When placing such a big order,

882
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,280
one should investigate the background

883
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,070
of all the bidders.

884
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,150
But why Jun Qiluo?

885
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,710
Investigate that bidding inviter.

886
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,730
Yes.

887
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,590
My Lord, Jun Yujue is here.

888
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,760
Chancellor!

889
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,960
My Lord!

890
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,840
It's so unfair!

891
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,150
Jun Qiluo goes too far.

892
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,550
I'm generous enough

893
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,110
to let her open a shop.

894
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,360
But she got that big order,

895
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,280
snatching it from me.

896
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,670
Enough.

897
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,150
Dealing with Jun Qiluo

898
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,880
is a piece of cake.

899
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,230
Jun Yujue,

900
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,800
if the Chancellor helped you,

901
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,550
how will you repay him?

902
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,720
Chancellor,

903
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,070
you name it.

904
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,070
As long as I can do it,

905
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,710
I'll do it without hesitation.

906
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,670
I want 20% of your profit.

907
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,480
Jun Yujue,

908
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,070
you achieve nothing for a reason.

909
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,150
Why does that sound so familiar?

910
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,840
Fine.

911
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,960
Twenty percent profit it is.

912
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,800
I'll give it to you.

913
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,000
But on one condition,

914
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
you must get rid of

915
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,710
Jun Qiluo for me.

916
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,760
I don't want to see her again.

917
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,030
It's you?

918
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,880
You pretend to be a merchant.

919
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,920
My Lady, don't trust him.

920
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,320
Shao Qimin,

921
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,320
I just signed a contract with Qiluo.

922
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
We'll be working together now.

923
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,550
Not now.

924
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,960
Just now, Jiangjuan said

925
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,190
Xiukun has prepared the wedding attire,

926
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,670
