17
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,430
Jun Qiluo,

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,070
how dare you mobilize
the Surveillance without my permission

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,480
and repeatedly involve outsiders

20
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,480
in meddling with Yannan politics?

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,350
The Jun family needs to be punished.

22
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,400
Guards, take her away.

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,870
- Yes.
- Your Majesty.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
I...

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Move.

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,710
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,800
Qiluo is my wife.

28
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,850
You can't do this to her.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,910
What do you mean?

30
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,870
Why do you intervene
in Yannan's affairs?

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,520
I gave up the Wolf Lord position
for Qiluo

32
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,750
because I wanted
to maintain peace for her.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,800
If you insist on harming her today,

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
I am certain

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,310
Yannan will never know peace again.

36
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,750
What? Are you threatening me?

37
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,190
Are you willing to disregard

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,400
the fragile relationship
between Yannan and Beixuan

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,870
for a woman?

40
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,280
It's not like that.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,930
Qiluo not only helped Yannan
develop its economy

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,090
but worked tirelessly in Beixuan
to promote peace.

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,400
And now you want to punish her.

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,940
From now on,

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,030
will there still be any people in Yannan

46
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,680
loyal to you wholeheartedly?

47
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,120
Though you're no longer the Wolf Lord,

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,960
you are still a noble of Beixuan.

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,400
I want you to guarantee

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,870
that whatever happens in the future,

51
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,190
the peace between us must be a priority.

52
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,080
As for how to maintain it,

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,190
you'll have to prove it with your life.

54
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,190
Let Jun Qiluo go.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,470
What did you just promise the King?

57
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,870
I said you're my wife,

58
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,630
and I'd fight anyone

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,500
who dares to harm you,

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,960
even the King of Yannan.

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
He let you go,

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,400
so I'm considering letting him go.

63
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,030
Young Master,

64
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,920
the Princess started packing yesterday.

65
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,200
She said she wanted to return.

66
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
Lie.

67
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,000
Lie.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
Qingkou.

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
Where's Qingming?

70
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,680
Didn't he come back with you?

71
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,230
Lie.

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,110
I've made up my mind.

73
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,200
I want Qingming to return
to Beixuan with me.

74
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,270
When we get back,

75
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,390
I'll have my brother buy us a big house.

76
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,070
Then I'll let everyone know

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,000
Qingming is my husband.

78
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,560
Princess,

79
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Shao Qimin is already...

80
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,830
Shao Qimin went to the Uncontrollable.

81
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,070
He asked you to wait for him in Beixuan.

82
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,070
Why don't you go back
and tidy up the house for him?

83
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,480
That way, when he returns,

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,270
he can be at ease.

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Alright then.

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,920
I'll return and wait for him.

87
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,680
But I don't know what he likes

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
and how I should decorate our home.

89
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,790
Princess,

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,680
I can tell you.

91
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,270
Really?

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,390
Tell me. What does he like?

93
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Young Master,

94
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,290
let me take the Princess back.

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
Sure.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
This place might remind her of him.

97
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,030
When you return to Beixuan,

98
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,310
tell the King and Queen Mother
what happened

99
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,870
and ask them to protect Qingkou.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,140
Young Master, rest assured.

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,630
I'll protect the Princess too.

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,700
(Spirit Tablet of Shao Qimin,
Jun Chengliu's Adopted Son)

103
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,270
Qimin had followed you for years.

104
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,750
I'd long treated him like my own child.

105
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,510
Though he was a spy of the King,

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
he had never harmed us.

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
(Spirit Tablet of Shao Qimin)

108
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
And he had never known any happiness.

109
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,260
(Spirit Tablet of Shao Qimin)
I hope in his next life,

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,750
he can find a good family.

111
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,720
I just hope in his next life,

112
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,270
he can live for himself

113
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,270
without suffering.

114
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,580
(Spirit Tablet of Shao Qimin,
Jun Chengliu's Adopted Son)

115
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,140
(Jun Mansion)

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,920
- What's wrong?
- Young Master.

117
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,510
News from the scout you sent to Xixiang.

118
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,120
It says Luo Zhizhou has left Xixiang.

119
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,920
It seems he's secretly
recruiting soldiers.

120
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,240
Any news from the Palace?

121
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,270
Not long ago, I heard

122
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,220
Consort Li passed away.

123
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,070
He must've known
about Consort Li's death.

124
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,160
The King must be in danger.

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,270
What should we do now?

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,560
The King has no good generals at hand.

127
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,280
Zhaomin has gone
to suppress the bandits.

128
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,590
I'm afraid...

129
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,470
Go back.

130
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,800
The physician said you need to rest.

131
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,590
Xuan Lie.

132
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,390
Go back.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,480
I know even if you're no longer
the Wolf Lord,

134
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,240
you can never forget
your responsibilities,

135
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,190
just like the weight of Yannan
and my family to me.

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,590
Back then,

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
it was I who let Zhizhou go.

138
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,170
Now that the King is in trouble,

139
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
no matter what,
I must go back to face it.

140
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,590
But Qiluo...

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
I understand you.

142
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,730
I understand your reluctance

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,070
and your dilemma.

144
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,160
You go take care of your issues.

145
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Though I can't go with you,

146
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,000
and you can't stay here forever,

147
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,340
we still have a long time ahead of us.

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,310
The short separation now

149
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,390
is only for a better reunion later.

150
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,360
Qiluo, rest assured.

151
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,270
I'll be responsible
for you and the child.

152
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,860
(Serenity Amidst Nature)

153
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,610
Are you here to see me off?

154
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,440
Don't flatter yourself.

155
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,030
I'm here to see Lie off.

156
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,440
Are you still blaming me?

157
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,870
Who's blaming you?

158
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,440
You're not someone close to me.

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,120
You know my feelings best.

160
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,630
How could you say that?

161
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,360
It hurts my feelings.

162
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,840
And your sudden departure
won't hurt my feelings?

163
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,220
(Jun Mansion)

164
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
So, you're blaming me.

165
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,870
I'd tell you if I could,

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,350
but it happened too fast,

167
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,440
so I didn't have the time.

168
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,390
I've followed the young master
for years.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,520
I must see things through to the end.

170
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,510
When I return,

171
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,270
I'll marry you in a grand procession.

172
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,790
Who wants to marry you?

173
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,030
I want to marry someone
who can stay in Yannan

174
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,040
and take care of my family
as a live-in husband.

175
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,480
I've made up my mind.

176
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,720
I can meet your third condition.

177
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,750
When I triumph,

178
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
I'll bring my dowry

179
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,890
and marry into your family.

180
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
Don't worry.

181
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,910
Once I make a promise,

182
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll never break it.

183
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,390
When I return, we'll marry.

184
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,790
Then I'll write you many novels.

185
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,650
I wanted to embroider a pouch for you,

186
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,390
but last night, I heard
from Qiluo that you're leaving,

187
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,480
so I changed it
into an amulet overnight.

188
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,670
The light was dim,

189
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,320
and I bled a lot.

190
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,750
If you dare come back missing limbs,

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,390
I will never forgive you.

192
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,360
Do you hear me?

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Don't worry.

194
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,280
With this on me,

195
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,200
I'll return safely.

196
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
It's getting late.

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,600
You should leave now.

198
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,750
Remember to write
to tell us you're safe.

199
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,390
Mr. Jun, please stay.

200
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
You should stay here.

201
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,000
You have great ambitions.

202
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,910
How could I stop you?

203
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,270
But Xuan Lie,

204
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,510
Qiluo is now your wife.

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
You're my son-in-law.

206
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,080
You must always remember

207
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,440
to take care of yourself.

208
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,840
When everything is over,

209
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,550
I'll come back and marry Qiluo.

210
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,300
(Jun Mansion)

211
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,910
Take care of yourself.

212
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,710
Wait for me.

213
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,700
(Jun Mansion)

214
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,320
Why the sigh, Qiluo?

215
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,790
Lie isn't leaving forever.

216
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Once he returns,

217
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,910
the King of Beixuan
won't let him go easily.

218
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
No one knows when we'll meet again.

219
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,910
Then why did you let him leave?

220
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,030
Because we have responsibilities,

221
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,390
and neither of us
can easily abandon them.

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,630
Compared to the greater good,

223
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,320
romance is insignificant.

224
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
Qiluo, don't worry.

225
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,790
If Lie doesn't return,

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,870
I'll help you raise this child.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,630
Just now, you and Luo Qi...

228
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,870
I suddenly remembered

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,670
that Xiukun's Yunchang Workshop
is receiving

230
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,870
a batch of new goods today.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
Xiukun.

232
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,750
Qiluo.

233
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,270
I need to go with her to oversee it.

234
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,630
We'll leave now.

235
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,910
These officials

236
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,790
speak so sweetly on usual days,

237
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,510
but when I need them,
they say either that they're unwell

238
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,790
or that they have families to care for.

239
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,240
Everyone is backing out.

240
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,910
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,510
For the trading post,

242
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,960
officials need to be stationed
in three states long-term.

243
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,720
They'll be leaving their families
for decades,

244
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,480
so it's understandable
they need time to think.

245
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,720
You actually understand them.

246
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,150
Your Majesty, you jest.

247
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,870
I'm just worried you'll get upset
over these trivialities

248
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,030
and harm your health.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,840
Report.

250
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,870
Your Majesty,
Jun Qiluo is waiting outside.

251
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,040
Let her in.

252
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,240
(Blessed Forever)
Jun Qiluo may come in.

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

254
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,200
Rise.

255
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,480
I've prepared the 150,000 bolts of silk

256
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,550
that I promised you.

257
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,630
It has been handed over

258
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,570
to the envoy heading to Beixuan
for inspection.

259
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,630
Good.

260
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,320
Your Majesty,

261
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,550
I just overheard you discussing

262
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,910
the stationing at the Uncontrollable.

263
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,070
I'm willing to go on behalf of Yannan

264
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,240
to relieve you of this concern.

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,590
I've been in business for over a decade,

266
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,120
and I'm familiar with the area
due to the robbing accident.

267
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,270
No one is more suitable than me.

268
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,630
You still want to leave Yannan.

269
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,940
Your Majesty, rest assured.

270
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
The Jun family is loyal to Yannan.

271
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,840
Yannan will always be my motherland,

272
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
and I'll only serve Yannan.

273
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,510
Here are the designs and samples
of the new weapon.

274
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,440
Heaven and earth can bear witness

275
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
to my devotion to Yannan.

276
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,770
The reason why I want to go

277
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,510
is not only to ease your worries.

278
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,870
I've been in business for many years,

279
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,960
and the trading post is a business area.

280
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,480
That's something I'm most skilled at.

281
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,870
Your Majesty,

282
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,960
Miss Jun's words make sense.

283
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,150
In terms of business and trade,

284
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,320
there is no one in Yannan

285
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,480
more suitable than Miss Jun.

286
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,870
These past few days,

287
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,270
I have seen how important
your family is to you.

288
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,840
Once Beixuan has cleared the bandits

289
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,510
in the Uncontrollable,

290
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,120
you can go on behalf of Yannan.

291
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,150
Remember your promise.

292
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,440
If fulfilled,

293
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,720
your family will always have peace.

294
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,790
But if you harbor ill intentions...

295
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,480
You can punish them as you see fit.

296
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Good.

297
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,860
(Leather City)

298
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,030
Put down your weapons,

299
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,580
and join the Danyang Army.

300
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,790
Then you will be spared.

301
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,350
Stop talking nonsense.

302
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,960
Everyone, attack!

303
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,750
Princess Zhaomin is risking her life

304
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,110
to eliminate bandits as a woman,

305
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,480
yet none of the civil
and military officials

306
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,160
are willing to be stationed
at the trading post.

307
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,950
What do you think

308
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,440
of this matter?

309
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,960
I can't comment on state affairs.

310
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,110
I've asked you to comment.

311
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,480
Yes.

312
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,200
From what I see,

313
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,610
the Uncontrollable is closest
to Liangzhou.

314
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Why not let Princess Zhaomin

315
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,270
take care of the trading post

316
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,030
after the bandits are cleared?

317
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,400
She's just a woman.

318
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,640
Managing a clan is not easy.

319
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,570
Clearing the bandits is hard enough.

320
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,510
If she has to be stationed
at the trading post,

321
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,110
she may not be able to bear it.

322
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,150
Yes.

323
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,830
I was thoughtless.

324
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,310
What's that sound outside?

325
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,390
Your Majesty,

326
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,390
the traitor Luo Zhizhou

327
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,240
led Death Warriors to storm the Palace.

328
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,080
What?

329
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,000
Your Majesty.

330
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,350
Luo Zhizhou is not dead?

331
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,480
How is that possible?

332
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,440
I don't know either.

333
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,000
Your Majesty, Deputy He Jiyao
is leading the Forbidden Troops

334
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,270
to fight Qingtang Death Warriors.

335
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,280
Your Majesty,

336
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
the Wolf Lord is not in the city.

337
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,880
How about I escort you out
through the West Gate first?

338
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,430
How absurd.

339
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,680
He's clearly aimed at me.

340
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,410
How could I escape a battle?

341
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,400
If I truly run,

342
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,550
what will happen to the Queen Mother,

343
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,740
the Princess, and the people?

344
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,590
He's seeking death.

345
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,240
I'll grant his wish.

346
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,870
Your Majesty...

347
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,260
(Xuanwu Palace)

348
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,950
Luo Zhizhou,

349
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,550
you deceived your King
and escaped from prison.

350
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,270
And now you're even attacking the city.

351
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,960
How dare you!

352
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,400
Today, I will seek justice for Fanyin.

353
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,270
Protect the King!

354
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,110
Attack!

355
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,960
Your Majesty, you can't go.

356
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,590
Get out of the way!

357
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,040
Let go!

358
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,550
- Save the King!
- Your Majesty, go!

359
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,860
(Central Town)

360
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,160
You have to go now!

361
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,920
- Let go of me!
- Your Majesty, go!

362
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,150
Xuan Xu!

363
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,150
Xuan Xu!

364
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,790
You made me do this.

365
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,160
I had decided never to return to Beixuan

366
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,640
so she could live,

367
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,550
but why wouldn't you let Fanyin go?

368
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,630
Shut up!

369
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,830
I only want to help her
escape this cage.

370
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,070
What's wrong with that?

371
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,880
It's you and the Queen Mother's fault!

372
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,680
You arrogant Beixuan nobles

373
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,680
always look down on foreigners!

374
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,520
How dare you!

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,660

376
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
Zhizhou!

(Xuanwu Palace)

378
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,350
Lie,

379
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
kill him for me.

380
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,280
Kill him!

381
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,520
Lie,

382
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,440
why are you back to protect him?

383
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,960
We helped him ascend the throne,

384
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,680
and you helped him get
the Five Clans' military powers.

385
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,070
You've done so much for him,

386
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,000
but how has he treated you in return?

387
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
Shut your mouth!

388
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,310
I am the King of Beixuan.

389
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,720
How can I be lost in personal feelings?

390
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,110
You are so heartless and ungrateful.

391
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,960
Today, I will surely kill you.

392
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,870
Zhizhou!

393
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,440
Don't come any closer!

394
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,040
Lie...

395
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,760
Lie...

396
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,110
Luo Zhizhou!

397
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,630
Zhizhou...

398

Zhizhou...

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,430
Zhizhou...

400
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,240
Why?

401
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,310
Why did you come back?

402
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
Why?

403
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,790
I owe you my life.

404
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,920
At last, I've repaid it to you.

405
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,270
I'm glad you can kill me.

406
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,640
I have no regrets in this life.

407
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,940
I hope in the next life,

408
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,960
we'll be brothers again.

you'd stay in Yannan forever.

431
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,270
You were in trouble.

432
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,920
I must return.

433
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,630
What?

434
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,310
Are you still angry with me?

435
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,110
You've been hiding the news

436
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,680
that Luo Zhizhou is not dead from me.

437
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,640
Shouldn't you offer to be punished?

438
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,110
You can punish me

439
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,680
as you see fit.

440
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,750
You know I won't punish you.

441
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,070
Let alone you protected me today.

442
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,440
And not long ago, you ordered He Jiyao

443
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,510
to bring the Princess back safely.

444
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,110
Tell me.

445
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,720
What reward do you want?

446
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,830
I'll award you handsomely.

447
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,270
Protecting Qingkou is my duty
as her brother.

448
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,960
This trip to Yannan

449
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,830
was the best decision I've ever made,

450
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,960
or I would've regretted it
for the rest of my life.

451
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,790
But I didn't expect

452
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,640
that not only did Jun Qiluo survive,

453
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,590
but she's also carrying your child.

454
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,190
Forget it.

455
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,640
Now, we've unified the Five Clans

456
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,270
and completed
the peace talks with Yannan.

457
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,790
The example of Luo Zhizhou
is in front of us.

458
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,400
I will no longer pursue

459
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,000
your personal feelings.

460
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,830
However, if you continue

461
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,920
to resist the Wolf Lord position,

462
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
I won't spare you

463
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,850
and your Xuan Clan.

464
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,110
What?

465
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,110
Are you really going
to abandon everything

466
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
and go to Yannan?

467
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,120
Have you forgotten your promise
to General Xuan Shu?

468
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,680
Now, you bear

469
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,480
the responsibility
of the entire Beixuan.

470
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,920
Are you really going
to escape your promise for a woman?

471
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,200
Can your conscience
be at peace with that?

472
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,800
Fine.

473
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,240
I won't force you.

474
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,510
You can be with Jun Qiluo.

475
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,100
But now,

476
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,440
I have no capable generals left.

477
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,590
Even Zhaomin, a woman,

478
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,050
has been sent to eliminate bandits
in the Uncontrollable.

479
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,550
Therefore, you must be

480
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,880
the Wolf Lord.

481
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,150
Thank you, Xu.

482
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,350
I will not fail in my mission.

483
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,030
Earlier, when you wanted to reward me,

484
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,800
I refused.

485
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,720
But I do have one request.

486
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,060
The post has to be established

487
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,450
due to the peace talks now.

488
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,110
I know you've been looking

489
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,310
for someone to go to the Uncontrollable.

490
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,270
It started because of me,

491
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,270
so why not let me take care of it?

492
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,750
I will not fail in my duty.

493
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,880
Fine. I will agree to this.

494
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,720
But no matter where you are,

495
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,400
you must always remember

496
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,270
you are the Wolf Lord of Beixuan

497
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,880
and the leader of the Xuan Clan.

498
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,720
I will.

499
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

500
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,100
(One year later;
The Uncontrollable Trading Post)

501
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,680
Miss, come and have a look.
Anything you like?

502
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,180
Feel free to choose whatever you want.

503
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,550
Not long ago, Zhaomin sent a letter,

504
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,250
saying everything in Liangzhou was fine.

505
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,480
The Silver Embroidery made
the people of Liangzhou wealthy.

506
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,870
She's also planning to open a branch.

507
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,240
The Uncontrollable is now so orderly

508
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,830
thanks to her

509
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,260
eliminating the bandits back then.

510
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,110
Zhaomin is more and more like a general.

511
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,440
I believe Mr. Sun's spirit
in the heavens

512
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,070
must be relieved.

513
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,950
By the way,

514
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,690
where are Luo Qi and He Jiyao?

515
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,960
Why didn't they come?

516
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,000
Jiangjuan!

517
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,350
Jiangjuan!

518
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,480
Jiangjuan!

519
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,880
Look here.

520
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,680
It's recorded in detail.

521
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,550
You must learn from this.

522
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,030
You have to do exactly the same.

523
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,870
I see.

524
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,030
- Jiangjuan, I'm back!
- Remember it.

525
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,000
I thought after you returned to Beixuan,

526
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,650
the King of Beixuan
wouldn't let you go back to me.

527
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,320
I will never

528
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,550
break my promise to you.

I miss you.

533
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,420
How did you know
I'm in the Uncontrollable?

534
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,760
You are my wife,

535
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,510
so I naturally know your thoughts.

536
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,380
I'd like to discuss something with you.

537
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,390
What is it?

538
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,030
We have Xuan Chu and Jun Shuo now,

539
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,320
but only one can inherit your mantle.

540
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,550
So I think

541
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,070
at least one child

542
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,230
should be educated
in the Jun family in Yannan.

A family should not be separated.

546
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,760
You misunderstand.

547
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,550
I don't want them to be separated.

548
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
I just want them to find their own place

549
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,150
and learn mutual understanding.

550
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,630
Even if they grow up
with different habits and views,

551
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,880
they are still bonded by blood.

552
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,330
They'll be more motivated than anyone
to maintain peace.

553
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,440
With our determination,

554
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,670
the Kings will be at ease.

555
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,200
Qiluo,

556
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,030
though we each have
our own responsibilities,

557
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,710
isn't it too cruel

558
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,030
to decide their future so soon?

559
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,590
We both have special identities.

560
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,440
They'll face it anyway.

561
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,920
I just think

562
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,480
that one day we'll grow old.

563
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,150
Whether it's guarding the trading post

564
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,800
or maintaining peace,

565
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,070
someone must carry on

566
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,440
for Yannan and Beixuan.

567
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,710
Our children

568
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,550
will be the best choice.

569
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,880
I believe when they grow up,

570
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,510
they'll understand our intentions.

I agree.

574
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,950
Now,

575
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,480
should we do something else?

576
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,120
Qiluo,
