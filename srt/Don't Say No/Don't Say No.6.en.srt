1
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,720
Hey Fiat, you okay?

2
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,640
Yeah, I'm fine.

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,800
You're trembling.
You sure you okay?

4
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,280
Yeah, I'm fine.

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,560
Let's go.

6
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,560
Too bad the shorts are long.

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,400
I love the beauty mark
on his right thigh.

8
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,400
EP.6: Lose the mind, lose the game

9
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,160
Long time no see.
You've changed a hubby?

10
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,320
Hey!

11
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,800
Damn, I missed you.

12
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Looks like your new boyfriend
is gonna lose to me.

13
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,600
Dammit!

14
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,159
Don't you think it's weird?

15
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Yeah, why is the other team's
captain keep guarding Fiat?

16
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,640
Well, why would he not?
Fiat's our team's scorer.

17
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,440
Isn't he too deliberate?
I saw him grab Fiat's butt.

18
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,960
- His butt?
- Yeah.

19
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,560
He's deliberately provoking Leo.

20
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
What do you know?

21
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,280
That guy is King, Leo's No. 1 rival.

22
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,320
Why couldn't you guys guard King!

23
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,400
I tried, but his teammates
were guarding me too.

24
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
That's right, I couldn't escape at all.

25
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,200
Dammit!

26
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,920
Let's sub players.

27
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
I'll sit out.

28
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
I don't wanna hold the team back.

29
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,920
Keep using the tactics.

30
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,080
I'll guard Fiat, and you guys
guard the rest tightly.

31
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
What if they sub players?

32
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,520
That's fine, I've got a backup plan.

33
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
The victory's certainly ours.

34
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,159
How do you feel eating my leftovers?

35
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,360
Shut up!

36
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,200
Can't stand that I ate him before you?

37
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,880
- Don't talk about my boyfriend like that.
- Well, he's my wife too.

38
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
I love his moan.

39
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,160
I'm speechless.

40
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,480
Bro, can we ask Papa to
get rid of that asshole?

41
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,960
Do you wanna go to jail
for attempted murder?

42
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,880
Papa can't help you with everything.

43
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,640
Let's go home.

44
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,840
We should leave them alone for today.

45
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,080
An, you must come with me.
They're fighting in the locker room.

46
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Shit.

47
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,080
- Let's go.
- Sure.

48
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,280
Stop, An can handle it.
You'll cause more trouble if you go.

49
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,760
- Didn't I tell you?
- What did you say, Rick?

50
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,880
I told you to calm down.

51
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,680
We lost because of your hot temper!

52
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,680
You blame me for the team's loss?

53
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,920
Yeah, that's right.

54
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,840
I wasn't gonna say anything.

55
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,840
But wasn't it you who got distracted?

56
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,960
Wasn't it you who made pass blunders?

57
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,280
You knew he was provoking you,
but you still fell for it.

58
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,800
- You know nothing at all!
- Then tell me!

59
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
Ever since you found out
who we'd play against...

60
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,560
...you never told me anything!

61
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,480
Tell me, what did King say to you?

62
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,200
Why did our team lose!

63
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,880
- We lost because...
- Because of me.

64
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,720
I'm sorry.

65
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
It's my fault.

66
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
Dammit!

67
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,880
Losing is one thing,
but don't be a sore loser.

68
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,080
Think about why you lost.

69
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,440
Make it right.

70
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
So that it won't happen again!

71
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,040
Oh, when you said you'd
take good care of the team captain.

72
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,680
Is this the best you can do, Leo?

73
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,520
Fiat looked like he was crying.

74
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,520
You know best who was hurt
the most by that incident.

75
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
"One Year Ago"

76
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,960
"One Year Ago"
Are you serious?

77
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,720
Yeah.

78
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,320
I saw with my own eyes.
P' Peam was on drugs.

79
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,880
But he hasn't played in the past games.

80
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,840
But I don't know what will happen
if the referees find out.

81
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,800
We may have to forfeit.

82
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,040
But this is our first final.

83
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Well...

84
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,840
We can't forfeit.

85
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,240
Leo's got high expectations of this game.
I know he wants to win.

86
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
What should we do, Fiat?

87
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,640
Oh, should we tell Leo?
He can definitely deal with it.

88
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,800
He might do something.

89
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,440
He... He can definitely help.

90
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,840
Can we talk?

91
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,840
Hey, don't look at me like that.

92
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,280
I won't tell anyone that
your teammate's on drugs.

93
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,400
But?

94
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,760
But...

95
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,440
You must sleep with me.

96
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,080
I won't sleep with you!

97
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,400
Why?

98
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,600
Because Leo and I are rivals?

99
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,800
But I've liked you for a long time, Fiat.

100
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,480
Think about it.

101
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,520
If you don't sleep with me...

102
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,880
...the fact that your teammate's on drugs
will reach the referees' ears.

103
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,920
And if you tell Leo, the referees
will find out about it too.

104
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,960
How can I be sure that
you'll keep your mouth shut?

105
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,040
Come on.

106
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,440
As an athlete, I understand...

107
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,440
...how disappointing it must be
when you finally make it to the final.

108
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,320
Besides.

109
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,280
That teammate of yours
hasn't even played.

110
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,160
Your team's won the games fair and square.

111
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,640
- Let me think about it.
- I'll give you 5 minutes.

112
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,880
Son of a bitch!

113
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,680
4 minutes 30 secs.

114
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,760
I don't trust someone like you.

115
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,599
Why? You wanna see Leo forfeits?

116
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,760
Come on, I swear.

117
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll keep the drug thing under my hat.

118
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
3 minutes 30 secs.

119
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,480
Only one minute left.
Well? What's your decision?

120
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,680
What a coincidence.

121
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
I've got the referee's number.

122
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,600
I wonder what's gonna
happen if I make a call.

123
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,080
Time's up.

124
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,040
Fine, I'll do it.

125
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,240
And if you don't keep
your word, I'll kill you!

126
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Hey.

127
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
What do you want?

128
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,360
Just wanna say hi.

129
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,600
Where's your captain-to-be?

130
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,320
Why? You want something from Fiat?

131
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,360
Already got it.

132
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,080
What a shame for you.
You guys are just friends, right?

133
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,960
He was hot as hell last time.

134
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,720
Leo, you ready?

135
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,840
Let's play together again, darling.

136
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Let's play fair and square today.

137
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,600
I thought you were crying.

138
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,000
Why would I cry?

139
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm sorry.

140
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,840
It's not your fault.

141
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,280
It's mine.

142
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,800
You're innocent.

143
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
P' Peam's the one to blame.

144
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
You were just trying
to protect the team.

145
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,040
How did you know about this?

146
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,520
After we lost in the final,
Natsu told me.

147
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,000
An knew about it too.

148
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,560
I was angry today.

149
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,480
But I wasn't angry with you.

150
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,760
I was angry that I couldn't protect you.

151
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,680
When I saw his face,
I felt I was weak.

152
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,280
Because I couldn't help you at all.

153
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,480
And I was angry.

154
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,720
That I let him toy me so easily.

155
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
I'm sorry.

156
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
Don't.

157
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
It's my fault anyway.

158
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,680
If I had figured out what to do...

159
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,440
...everything wouldn't
have turned out this way.

160
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,560
Where are you going?

161
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
I'm going home.

162
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,200
To think things through.

163
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,720
I'm sorry.

164
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
P' Leo, where's P' Fiat?

165
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,000
My purpose for coming here is to
congratulate you on your first win.

166
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,400
By the look of you, you lost?

167
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,440
Yeah.

168
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,920
Something happened?

169
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,960
You remember my rival
from the youth basketball camp?

170
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
King or Queen something?

171
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,080
King.

172
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
I remember.

173
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,800
The guy who always lost to
you when we were young?

174
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,040
I remember you said
he really loathed you.

175
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,200
So what happened?

176
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,520
So he knows how to provoke you.

177
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
He didn't tell the referees.

178
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,240
But distracted you by
attacking your weakness.

179
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,880
He forced P' Fiat to sleep with him
and bragged to you about it.

180
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,560
In the end, he won a clean victory.

181
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,280
He's capable.

182
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,600
He could be better,
if he didn't use dirty tricks.

183
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,200
He knew that you liked P' Fiat, right?

184
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,920
You're angry that you've dragged
P' Fiat into this feud, right?

185
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,000
In the end, your brother
isn't strong enough.

186
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,560
I know full well it's all in the past.

187
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,440
But when I saw him mess with Fiat,
I was so angry that my blood boiled.

188
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,040
Your brother isn't as
respectful as you think, Leon.

189
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,920
No matter what people say,
my big brother is the best.

190
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,440
Didn't you tell me?

191
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,840
A great man can be
vulnerable sometimes.

192
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,320
You're just vulnerable for a day.

193
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,720
I believe my brother
will be back to his old self.

194
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,160
Aren't you too confident?

195
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,120
'Cause it's my brother
I'm talking about!

196
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,920
It's good to have a
brothers talk once in a while.

197
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,240
But your lil bro likes you
when you're with P' Fiat more.

198
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,640
When you're back on your feet,
go get P' Fiat to bicker with me again.

199
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,760
Thanks a lot.

200
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,360
Jer?

201
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,760
What's wrong?

202
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,360
P' Pob!

203
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,920
Are you okay?

204
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,760
Yeah, I'm fine.

205
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,160
Though I'm not someone you trust,
if you wanna vent or say something...

206
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,960
...I'm willing to listen.

207
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,560
Jer's sick.

208
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,720
How is she?

209
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,880
The vet said she's fine now.

210
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,840
But since they found
strange symptoms...

211
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,560
...they wanted to do
a thorough diagnosis.

212
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,760
And I've only just found out
that Jer's been weak since birth.

213
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,240
All this time, I've only
gotten her vaccinated.

214
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,480
I should've known better.

215
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,040
Because she was abandoned
by her mom since young.

216
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,800
You adopted her right
after she was born?

217
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,240
No.

218
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,480
When I found her,
she was about a month old.

219
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,160
I found her behind a building.

220
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,200
She was so gaunt.

221
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,440
So I gave her food.

222
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,120
But I didn't dare touch her.

223
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,280
I was afraid her mom would
be unfamiliar with the scent.

224
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,120
But every time I met her,
she was always alone.

225
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,000
So I asked around
and found out that...

226
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,320
...Jer was abandoned since young
and her siblings were all dead.

227
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,760
So that's why you kept
giving her food, right?

228
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
Yeah.

229
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,160
I actually wanted to adopt her
ever since I found her.

230
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,160
But I needed to get settled
into my dormitory first.

231
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,360
I should've gotten her
a more thorough checkup.

232
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,120
But if you feel sorry,
Pobjer will be sorry too.

233
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,360
For stressing her dear daddy out like this.

234
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,200
How do you know?
Are you Pobjer?

235
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,880
Though I'm like this,
I'm still a lion.

236
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,080
Leo's my zodiac sign,
and my name means 'lion'.

237
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,720
They are of the same species.

238
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,320
Thanks.

239
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,920
Always happy to help.

240
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,720
I couldn't help you much,
but at least you've still got me.

241
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,840
Fiat.

242
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,160
I need to talk to you.

243
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,600
I don't wanna talk to you now.

244
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,960
Let me talk to our teammates first.

245
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,880
I'm...

246
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,080
I'm sorry for making us lose the game.

247
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,640
P' Fiat, that's enough.

248
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,520
In sports, you win some, you lose some.

249
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,800
It's okay.

250
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Right, P' Rick?

251
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,240
I'm really sorry.

252
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,000
From now on, I'll try harder
as the team captain.

253
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,040
I need to talk to you.

254
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,640
What!

255
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,320
That fucker did that to you?

256
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,720
More like I did it to myself.

257
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
Dammit.

258
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,360
If knew earlier,
I would've never let him go.

259
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Dammit!

260
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,080
I wanna punch him in the face.

261
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,040
Leo.

262
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,280
I'm sorry.

263
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,120
If I knew what he did to you,
I wouldn't have blamed you.

264
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,719
It's okay.

265
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,080
It's also my fault.

266
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,760
- I couldn't control myself.
- I'd be surprised if you could.

267
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,920
He forced your boyfriend to sleep with him.

268
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,719
He clearly targeted you.

269
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,159
I wouldn't be able
to control myself too.

270
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,679
Don't tell the teammates about this.

271
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,679
Sure, there's no way I'll tell them.

272
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,880
But why did you tell
me about this, Fiat?

273
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,600
Well...

274
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,639
I want you to be a witness
to my becoming a better person.

275
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
I'll try harder.

276
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,720
For him.

277
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,880
What did you mean when you said...

278
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,000
...'for me'?

279
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,480
From young till now,
I've always done foolish things.

280
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,480
I've been stupid, childish,
and too emotional.

281
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,120
But from now on...

282
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,040
...I won't be like that anymore.

283
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,160
I'll become mature and sensible.

284
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,640
I'll become adult enough
to wear this necklace.

285
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,480
I'll become good enough to wear
this matching necklace your mom gave me.

286
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,960
- But...
- I know.

287
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,520
I know you won't tell anyone
about the things I've done.

288
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,920
And you won't talk about
other people in a bad way.

289
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,080
I'll do everything you say.

290
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,600
I'll move forward.

291
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,920
And this...

292
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,120
...will be the proof that
I won't stuck in the past.

293
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,240
Are you sure?

294
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,240
Yeah.

295
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,000
But I need time.

296
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,960
I just found out that
I've got tons of problems.

297
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,200
C'mere.

298
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,320
I'll be fine.

299
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,400
As long as your goal...

300
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,240
...is my embrace.

301
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,200
Whose boyfriend are you?

302
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,640
So fucking cheesy.

303
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,600
I've learned it from my brother.

304
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,120
Stop.

305
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,320
Achoo!

306
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,360
You okay?

307
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,800
I'm fine.

308
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,120
I think someone's gossiping about me.

309
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,280
Definitely P' Fiat.

310
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,960
Actually, you don't
have to walk me back.

311
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,040
My dorm's around the corner.

312
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,280
But I want to walk you back.

313
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,360
Oh P' Pob, wanna visit Pobjer?
I can drive you to the vet.

314
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,680
It's okay, the vet told me
to pick her up tomorrow.

315
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,160
If I go today, my heart
probably can't take it.

316
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,560
Her cry's so pitiful.

317
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,160
Is that so?

318
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,080
I don't wanna leave.

319
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,160
But I don't have any more excuses.

320
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
I don't wanna leave.

321
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,240
Don't wanna leave. Don't wanna leave.
Don't wanna leave. Don't wanna leave.

322
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,800
Then...

323
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,640
...I'm leaving.

324
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,040
Leon.

325
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,360
Do you wanna come up?

326
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Yes!

327
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,280
- Sit anywhere you want.
- Yes.

328
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,720
Can I ask you something?

329
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,320
Who's the man in the picture?

330
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,200
My adoptive father.

331
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,160
The man who adopted me.

332
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,640
But...

333
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,200
He passed away.

334
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,040
I'm sorry for asking.

335
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,720
It's fine.

336
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,920
You must be feeling lonely
without Pobjer around.

337
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,360
Yeah, I am.

338
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,040
I've got a solution.

339
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,720
Try talking to the keychain I gave you.
It looks similar to Pobjer.

340
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,440
You want me to talk to a keychain?

341
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,320
How about raising a plant?

342
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,960
They say raising a plant
can calm your mind.

343
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,400
I'd better spend my time doing
the thesis, or I won't graduate.

344
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,760
How about playing games?

345
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,760
I'm bad at it.

346
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,240
You don't like this,
You can't do that.

347
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,040
There's another way.
Definitely works.

348
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,400
If you're lonely, call me.

349
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,960
Whatever the time and place,
if you're lonely or Pobjer's sick...

350
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,920
...you can always call me.

351
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,040
But if you don't like the idea,
then never mind.

352
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,560
Leon, didn't you say
you'd take it slow?

353
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,840
How can I call you
if I don't know your number?

354
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,760
Do you know, P' Pob?

355
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,240
If this was a competition, I'd be...

356
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,120
...utterly defeated by you.

357
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,960
Don't you have a home to return to?

358
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,600
This is my home too. Dad hasn't
transferred the ownership to P' Leo yet.

359
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,720
Though you're P' Leo's boyfriend,
you've got no right to kick me out.

360
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,200
-'Cause you've been smiling nonstop.
- So what?

361
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,520
If you wanna smile,
go do it at your home.

362
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,040
Why are you doing it here?

363
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,800
You're gonna bang my brother.

364
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,880
Since you know it,
then go home already.

365
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,960
You know what?

366
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,400
I'm fucking happy that
P' Pob's different from you.

367
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,440
How do you know that?

368
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,200
- Well? Well?
- Don't compare.

369
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,800
You'll lose.

370
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,880
I think you've been
daydreaming too much.

371
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,920
If your P' Pob turns out to be
like me, how will you feel?

372
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,240
- Hmm?
- I don't care.

373
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,960
What kind of a person are you?
So fucking selfish.

374
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,520
Are you really Leo's brother?

375
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,880
I fucking grew up with you, P' Fiat.

376
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,840
When I said I didn't care,
I was talking about P' Pob's past.

377
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,360
I like the present P' Pob, get it?

378
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,920
I don't wanna argue with you.

379
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,000
You moron.

380
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,040
Yes, you are.

381
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,680
Wanna complain to P' Leo
after you lost the argument?

382
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,280
Go ahead, tell him.
I'm feeling happy now.

383
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,960
Even if 10 P' Leos come beating
me up, I'll still face them with a smile.

384
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,920
Fought with him again?

385
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,920
Your brother's a pain in the ass.

386
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,440
Will he be staying for dinner?

387
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,520
Don't know, go ask him yourself.

388
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,800
Really, and you said
you wanted to grow up.

389
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,720
You become childish
whenever you're with Leon.

390
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,080
Your brother started it.

391
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,840
Feed me.

392
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,000
Hot!

393
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,720
Are you okay?

394
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,840
Open your mouth.

395
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,800
Open your mouth.
Is your tongue swollen?

396
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,000
Open your mouth,
I'll check your tongue.

397
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,480
That's better.

398
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,400
You really.

399
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,600
If Leon isn't here...

400
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,720
What? What are you gonna do?

401
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,200
P' Leo, help me! Help me!
Oww! Owww! Ouch!

402
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,120
- What is it now?
- Ouch, P' Leo!

403
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,800
P' Leo, help me! Help me! Oww!

404
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,240
Oww!

405
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,160
Didn't I tell you to keep me
updated from time to time?

406
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,080
But ever since you've been back,
have you ever called me?

407
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,760
P' Leo, help me!

408
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,240
No, don't ask your brother to help you.

409
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,560
You're unbelievable!

410
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,640
You promised to send word
about your brother and Fiat.

411
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,520
How dare you didn't pick up my calls?

412
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,720
Gosh, so tired.

413
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,600
When did you come back, Mom?

414
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,240
You should've told me,
so I could pick you up.

415
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,040
It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you.

416
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,400
I hurried here after
I left my luggage at home.

417
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,800
Fiat.

418
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,080
Come here, let me hug you.

419
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,360
Come on, come.

420
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,280
I missed you, Mom.

421
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,080
Yeah, that's why I'm back
to give you a hug.

422
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,280
- Right?
- Yes.

423
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,800
My crybaby.

424
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,680
How are you? You okay?

425
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,440
Did you fight with Leo?

426
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,160
You're so biased.

427
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,760
I'm your real son.

428
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,720
Oh, come here, come here.

429
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,120
Wanna get scolded again? Huh?

430
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:04,000
P' Leo, if I become an unloved child,
it'll be because of your boyfriend.

431
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,480
Hey, hey.

432
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Watch your mouth.

433
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,320
You know that he's the favorite son.

434
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,680
And we're the unwanted sons?
