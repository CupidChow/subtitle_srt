1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,040
You got your friends to lie about
wanting to discuss Bye Nior party with me?

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,240
If I didn't do it, you wouldn't
have talked to me alone.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,600
Yeah, I don't want to be alone with you.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,440
Well, you wouldn't be this
cold if it was P' Fiat, right?

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,680
Yes, because he's my boyfriend.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,240
Then I guess you don't wanna know
what P' King's planning to do with P' Fiat.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,280
What's King trying to do?

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,880
Since you don't wanna
talk to me, I'm leaving.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,080
What's he trying to do with Fiat?

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,200
I'm not telling you.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,960
You've always been mean to me, P' Leo.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,040
So why should I help you?

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,760
What do you want?

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,120
You know I like you, right?

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,560
Then, can I kiss you?

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,640
I won't do it.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Then I guess you don't care
what P' King's trying to do with P' Fiat.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,840
So what's it gonna be?

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,200
Are you happy now?
Then get away from me.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,160
So what's King's plan?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm not telling you.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,640
You think I'll tell you when you
clearly show your disgust for me?

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,160
You know what?

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,040
I won't tell you anything
until you satisfy me.

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,680
Hurry up.

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,440
- Well? Did you get it?
- Definitely. Here.

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,079
Punn, P' Fiat saw what happened.

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,880
- What?
- I know.

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,640
When I was taking the photo,
he appeared out of nowhere.

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,480
And watched you guys for a long time.

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,560
This is bad.

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,320
Will this screw up P' King's plan?

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
Where's he now?

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
Why didn't he rush to
the scene and slap me?

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
That's the point.

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,840
He suddenly cried and walked away.

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
- He cried?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,800
P' King, I think your plan worked.

39
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,480
EP.11: Just want to be by your side

40
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,159
Why are you here?

41
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,200
I've got to finish reading this.

42
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,760
Besides, I won't get any sleep
if I sleep in your room.

43
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,680
Are you sure it's because of me?

44
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,960
You're saying it's me?

45
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,520
Isn't it?

46
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm not gonna argue with you.
I'm gonna keep reading.

47
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,200
By the way, I'm sleeping here tonight.

48
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
Got that?

49
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
Fine.

50
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,240
What time will you wake up tomorrow?
Let me wake you up.

51
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,080
It's okay, I can set the alarm.

52
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,200
Then I'm going to bed.

53
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,159
Okay.

54
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,080
Oh, Fiat.

55
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,200
Hmm?

56
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
Be on your guard
for the time being.

57
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,240
It's nothing, I'm just saying.

58
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Okay.

59
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,960
And...

60
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Good night.

61
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,760
Good night.

62
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
You've got to trust him.

63
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,640
Nothing's going on.

64
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,000
Leo won't cheat on you.

65
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,880
Why does it hurt so much?

66
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,400
Don't you think An's very fierce?
I really wanna tease her.

67
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,360
I know, right?
But she's got heavy slaps.

68
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,280
I've got goose bumps
thinking about it.

69
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,600
What's wrong?

70
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,240
- You weren't chased after like us.
- Yeah.

71
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,520
So why so gloomy?

72
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,840
How would you feel if you saw a scene
you'd never expected to see in this life?

73
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,880
The hell? So abstract.

74
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,240
The thing is, I saw that scene
and I was totally shocked.

75
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,960
I should've prepared my heart
since there's a chance it could happen.

76
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,640
What are you on about?
I don't get it.

77
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,200
Yeah, me too.

78
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,960
You know I like P' Leo, right?

79
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,920
Why do I need to know that?

80
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,200
I don't even know your name.

81
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
What do you think?

82
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,960
Something smells fishy.

83
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,320
Did you fart?

84
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,960
- Be quiet.
- I was talking about Fiat. Fart my ass.

85
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,800
Look at his face.

86
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,520
I bet there's more to this
than meets the eye.

87
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,400
Should we tell my bro?

88
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,600
Didn't you get enough scolding last time?

89
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Your bro swore to kill us
if we get into trouble again.

90
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,480
Why don't we tell Leo and An?

91
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,080
Not Leo.

92
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,760
He hasn't settled the old score with me.
I'll be dead if I bring him another one.

93
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,440
Now I'm even too
scared to joke with him.

94
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,600
- Then go tell An.
- Yeah, An.

95
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,680
If you wanna pick a fight,
you're barking up the wrong tree.

96
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,440
How confident of you.

97
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
Don't you know?

98
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,800
P' Leo's dating a guy like you
because he's never dated women.

99
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,360
And once he tries dating a woman,
he'll definitely love it.

100
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,240
Oh I'm confident.

101
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,360
But what are you confident about?

102
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,680
We both know
who P' Leo's parents are.

103
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,440
He'll get married some day.

104
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,840
His family has a reputation to uphold.

105
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,120
So he'll eventually end up
with a woman anyway.

106
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,200
His parents aren't even this stressed.

107
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,600
Who are you to feel
stressed about it?

108
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm gonna prove it to you.

109
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,400
In your dreams.

110
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,520
Are you saying this
because you're scared?

111
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,880
If you're not.

112
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,560
Then how about giving P' Leo
to me for a few weeks?

113
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
And I'll prove it to you.

114
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,240
I think you're daydreaming.

115
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,960
Wake up and grow up.

116
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
Live in reality.

117
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,960
Don't be delusional.

118
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,080
If there's nothing else,
then excuse me.

119
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,920
- He's leaving.
- Let's follow him.

120
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,880
Everyone!
We're going to the final!

121
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,080
Don't do it half-heartedly like last time.

122
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,960
Well, P' Leo?

123
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,040
You're gonna face P' King in the final.

124
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,200
So are you gonna satisfy me or what?

125
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,840
Or are you waiting for P' King
to carry out his plan?

126
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,360
Don't threaten me.

127
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm not threatening you.

128
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,960
It's just that P' King might
do something worse this time.

129
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,080
Fiat, it's not what you think.

130
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,880
It's okay, I'm not worried.

131
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,600
As for you.

132
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,360
Well? Did you satisfy my boyfriend?

133
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,160
But judging from your look,
I don't think so.

134
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:54,000
If you think you could drive me
crazy by kissing him, you're wrong.

135
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,640
I've known him for years.

136
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,280
What about you?
How long have you known him?

137
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,800
Don't compare yourself to me.

138
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,120
Since I'm the only one in his eyes.

139
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,600
Let's go, Leo.
Everyone's waiting.

140
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,280
Wait, I want to give you an explanation.

141
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
Hey, it's fine.

142
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:29,520
It's obvious that a certain loser
is trying to break us up.

143
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Let's go.

144
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
Rick's looking for you.

145
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,360
You go on ahead.
I'll go get something in the car.

146
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,760
Wait.

147
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,400
Do you want to know about Punn?

148
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,920
Nah, it'll pollute my ears.

149
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,079
Come on, it doesn't bother me.

150
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,920
Don't cry, Fiat.

151
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,200
You know she was trying
to get on your nerves.

152
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,080
So why are you crying?

153
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,680
Leo will never cheat on you.

154
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,400
But why?

155
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,120
Why couldn't I bear seeing
him kiss another person?

156
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
It fucking hurts.

157
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,880
The pain's killing me.

158
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,160
Stop crying, Fiat.
That's enough.

159
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,200
He's still fine after seeing you
sleep around for years.

160
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,280
But you only saw him with
another person for a brief moment.

161
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320

Why do you look happy
after getting punched?

A little hurt's nothing when
things went according to plan.

234
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,040
How did you make P' Leo
lose his mind like that?

235
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,200
He can never stay calm
when it comes to Fiat.

236
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Just a little push
and he goes boom.

237
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,840
By the way.

238
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,960
Don't you like Leo?

239
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,400
He's gonna hate you to death
seeing you team up with me.

240
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,080
It's true I like him.

241
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,480
And it's good if I can have him.

242
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
But if I can't...

243
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,680
...I won't let anyone have him too.

244
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,120
Besides, I hate P' Fiat
more than I like P' Leo.

245
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,920
If they break up, I can ask
my father to help me after that.

246
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,280
I can't promise they'll break up.

247
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,880
But their relationship
won't be the same.

To my satisfaction.

251
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,800
I already talked to my mom.
You don't have to go to the banquet.

252
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,720
Did she say anything?

253
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,600
She sulked a little bit.

254
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,680
Just a little bit?

255
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,360
She's already prepared
outfits for you and P' Fiat.

256
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,880
So she's probably unhappy.

257
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,800
I've got a feeling you wouldn't like
the outfit she's prepared.

258
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,240
Why?

259
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,520
You'd be too embarrassed to wear it
either because of the color or the design.

260
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
But P' Fiat's fine with anything.

261
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,320
Should I go to her and apologize?

262
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,760
No need, it's good that someone
goes against her wishes sometimes.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,920
Oh yeah, since you've
completed your thesis.

264
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,040
Why don't we hang out on the weekend?

265
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,640
I'm sorry.

266
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,320
I promised the children
that I would visit them.

267
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,880
At the orphanage?

268
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,720
Yeah.

269
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,240
What a pity.

270
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,920
But you're so cute
when you're with the children.

271

I can see you really
like this kind of work.

272
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
And I also like the way you are.

273
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,320
Do you remember what I said?

274
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,520
That I've turned my
father's dream into my own.

275
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,800
And I feel that I love
this dream more and more.

276
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,840

I'm happy when I see their smiles.

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,480
You can do it.
I'll give you my support.

279

What happened?

283
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,680
You were drunk,
so I took you home.

284
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,000
What have I done?

285
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,040
I saw you hug King.

286
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,920
I don't know what to feel anymore.

287
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
When I saw that...

288
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,280
...I was very angry.

289
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,560
So angry I couldn't control myself.

290
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,320
But now I'm hurting so much.

291
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,960
It hurts to see you...

292
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,120
...with him.

293
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,400
I...

294
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,440
I can't remember anything.

295
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,640
But I didn't hug him.

296
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,400
I was just talking with him.

297
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,280
And...

298
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,240
I know nothing happened.

299
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,280
I know he's playing
mind games with us.

300
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,160
But I can't help wondering
why you went to see him.

301
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,560
Why didn't you tell me?

302
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,520
Why did I have to
witness that fucking scene?

303
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,920
Why does it hurt so much?

304
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:11,440
When we were friends, I could
take it no matter who you were with.

305
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,679
But now.

306
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,639
Your face...

307
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,080
I don't even want to look at it.

308
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,719

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,800
What should I do?

336
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
He won't go see the doctor.

337
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,280
He won't do anything.

338
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,200
So where do I start?

339
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,160
Fiat, I'm hungry.
Let's go grab a bite.

340
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,600
Let's invite Tho too.

341
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,240
I'm not hungry.

342
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,920
I wanna eat pizza.
Let's order pizza.

343
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,000
I really miss Hawaiian pizza.
What type do you want?

344
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,520
I told you I'm not hungry.

345
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,960
I want fried chicken too.
Let's order some.

346
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,280
You know consoling
people isn't my forte.

347
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,840
You've come to the wrong place.

348
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,680
I don't wanna be consoled.

349
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,360
I just wanna sit quietly.

350
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,800
To be honest, Fiat.

351
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,920
I don't know why you guys fought.

352
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,240
But remember what you've been
through before you ended up together.

353
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,240
Don't let trifles bother you.

354
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Or maybe...

355
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,680
He and I...

356
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,200
...should be friends
instead of being lovers.

357
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,840
Shit, this is bad!

358
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,080
Tho, we have an emergency!
Come here now.

359
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,400
Move.

360
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,840
Stop him.

361
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,320
Leo, move your body.

362
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,160
Wake up, Leo.

363
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,520
Wake up.

364
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,720
You must wake up
before you get anymore hurt.

365
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,080
How long haven't I
had this kind of dream?

366
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,640
But whenever I see
you with other men...

367
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,720
...it still hurts.

368
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,200
Why aren't you picking up?

369
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,440
This is Leon.
You can stop calling, P' Nat.

370
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,240
I'll talk to him.

371
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,360
Why are you skipping the practice?

372
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,760
P' Fiat's skipping too.

373
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,600
The final's coming up in a few days.

374
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,480
As if skipping practice isn't enough,
you guys don't even go to classes.

375
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,440
Everyone's worried, you know?

376
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,880
He said we should go
back to being friends.

377
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,200
And you just agreed?

378
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,640
You mustn't do
everything as he pleases.

379
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,640
Take a look at yourself.

380
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,280
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- Go get him back!

381
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,520
What if he doesn't come back?

382
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,840
What if he drives me away?

383
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,840
I'm willing to be his friend.

384
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,120
Or any fucking thing.

385
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,680
Just so I could be by his side.

386
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,840
You can do anything he pleases.

387
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,000
But you mustn't hurt your
feelings while you do it.

388
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,560
You're wrong.

389
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,000
The greatest pain in my life...

390
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,640
...is to live without him.

391
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,760
Fiat, get up now! Get up!

392
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,520
- Let me go!
- Go talk to him!

393
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,120
- No!
- Get up!

394
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,280
Go talk it over with Leo.

395
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,520
- Fiat! Get up now!
- Let go!

396
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,800
Get up!

397
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
You guys fought,
so go talk things over.

398
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,920
Get up, Fiat.
Go talk it over with Leo.

399
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,040
I told you I'm not going!

400
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,120
What should we do, An?

401
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,040
Let him do as he pleases.

402
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,960
Hey, we can't do that!
We can't let them fight like this.

403
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,160
Come on, get up.

404
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,000
Let go.

405
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,760
You can keep fighting, but you
must not get other people in trouble.

406
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,520
Yeah.

407
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,120
The captain and the vice captain
doesn't care about the match.

408
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,760
How would the team feel?

409
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,680
- I really can't go see him.
- Why is that?

410
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,920
He told me he couldn't
even stand to look at my face.

411
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,880
Crazy, I don't believe you.

412
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,600
Let me go.

413
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,240
If I'm just his friend...

414
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,920
...he's probably
willing to look at me.

415
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,080
Stay with me.

416
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,400
Even if we have to go back
to being friends, I'm willing.

417
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,920
Can you bear to see a friend
like Leo has someone else?

418
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,800
If you're just friends, then you must feel
nothing when your friend has someone else.

419
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,080
Let's go, Nat.
He won't listen to us.

436
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,200
Nadia, how are you?

437
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,000
- Good evening, Lady Euam.
- Good evening.

438
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,280
The Thutanukul family is
holding a grand banquet this year.

439
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,800
Because it's an annual party.

440
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,080
Besides, I want my two sons
to make a debut in this party.

441
00:51:53,600 --> 00:52:00,000
Ooh, I saw both of them earlier.
They're all grown up now.

442
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,880
I've seen the big brother
from time to time.

443
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,880
But how many years has it been
since I last saw the younger one?

444
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,840
Now that I've met him.

445
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,600
He's become a handsome
young man just like his brother.

446
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,160
It appears they
take after their father.

447
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,680
Not at all.

448
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,560
What do you mean all grown up?

449
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,520
Those boys still act like babies.

450
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,800
- Still, thank you on the boys' behalves.
- My pleasure.

451
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,640
Oh, Madam Rasa's here.

452
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,120
- Now if you'll excuse me.
- Okay.

453
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,600
Excuse me.

454
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,280
- Sure.
- Sure.

455
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,280
Korn.

456
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:56,520
When I mentioned debuting,
I wasn't talking about our two losers.

457
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,640
I was talking about Fiat and Pob.

458
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,720
Since they don't want to come,
we can't force them.

459
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,600
I understand why Pob doesn't come.

460
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,160
But Fiat's another story.

461
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,520
I tried asking Leo for who
knows how many times.

462
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,520
Now I'm too tired to ask.

463
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,880
I've been trying to set
them up for many years.

464
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,600
If my plan fails, I'm gonna
be angry with your son.

465
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,640
My son is your son.

466
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,480
I don't care.

467
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,960
I've sent Fiat his outfit.
I hope he's coming.

468
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:52,080
Come on, let's just wait and see.
The party's just started.

469
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,600
Chill out.

470
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,000
P' Leo, why aren't you receiving guests?
Mom will get angry.

471
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,440
Why don't you do it?

472
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,840
If it hurts to be just friends.

473
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,920
Then why don't you do everything
in your power to get him back?

474
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,120
Because your brother
cares about his feelings.

475
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,400
But you care too much sometimes.

476
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,480
Which is why you've been
just a friend for almost 20 years.

477
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,880
Instead of being his
boyfriend for 10 years.

478
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,080
Think about it, P' Leo.

479
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,560
If I were you,
I wouldn't let him go.

480
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,160
Nam!

481
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,640
Jeez, my condo's become an almshouse.
You come and go as you please.

482
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,320
We've got an emergency here.
Where's Fiat?

483
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,760
Upstairs.

484
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,760
Come with me,
I need the keycard!

485
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,400
Hurry up, come with me!

486
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
- I'm playing a game here.
- Just come!

487
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,080
Fiat, have you seen
Nong Punn's IG story?

488
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,840
- No, why?
- Take a look.

489
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,200
Here.

490
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,720
[Ready for a date night
with an ambassador's son]

491
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,280
Who doesn't know that
Leo's an ambassador's son?

492
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,400
And she's been clinging
on to him for a year.

493
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,760
Dayum, she's gutsy.

494
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,080
Isn't she afraid he'll
kick her in the face?

495
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,400
Luckily, An's attending this event.
She'll keep Punn away from Leo.

496
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,120
But you mustn't let this go.

497
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,120
Fiat.

498
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,280
I'll ask you this one question,
and you need to answer me.

499
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,720
As Fiat, who I'm sure
loves Leo very much.

500
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,520
Will you really let him go?

501
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,120
Good evening, P' Leo.
Here you are, I've been looking for you.

502
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,920
Here you are, Ambassador's Son.
Be my date tonight.

503
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,920
Where are Aek and Tho?
Aren't they coming in place of their dad?

504
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,560
They'll be here soon.
So will you be my date or what?

505
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,960
It'd be my pleasure.

506
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,840
Oh?

507
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,800
How long have you been
standing here, Nong Punn?

508
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,360
I didn't notice.

509
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,080
I've been here for quite a while
before you came, P' An.

510
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,360
Sorry, I couldn't care less
about insignificant people.

511
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,360
Let's go, Leo.

512
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,520
P' Leo.

513
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,520
P' Leo, wait for me.

514
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,160
P' Leo, we still need to talk.

515
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:31,480
♪ There are times we don’t
understand one another ♪

516
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:40,840
♪ And it’s because
we refuse to communicate ♪

517
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:46,000
♪ I won’t let you say no ever again ♪

518
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,160
♪ Because I will show you ♪

519
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,280
So only you and I don't
attend the party, right?

520
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,120
Yeah, we're not noble
enought to get invited.

521
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,560
And what's wrong with you?
Why are you smiling like an idiot?

522
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,480
Nothing, I'm just glad
Fiat's attending the party.

523
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,280
Besides, An's drop-dead
gorgeous tonight.

524
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,360
This fucking sucks.
Everyone's got a lover.

525
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,680
Should I find one?

526
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,640
I forgot, being single
is my greatest fortune.

527
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,040
Better call someone
to ease my lonely heart.

528
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,320
Shit, I can only call the twins.

529
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,080
The hell?
There's no one else!
