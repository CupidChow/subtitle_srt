1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,920
He's the one who sent
the letter to your address.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,440
Remove the tape.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,920
Stay still.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,440
I'm gonna call the cops!

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,160
Go ahead, keep barking if you dare.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,000
Sending those photos to
my house, what do you want?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,120
I only wanted to tease your boyfriend.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,159
Who would've thought?

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
That you'd have these
fucking people beat me up.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,080
Just you wait.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,440
I'll have the cops arrest you for assault.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,040
Go ahead, call them.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,600
Leo, report him back for extortion.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,880
He used the clip to extort
money from Fiat's dad.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Did you think I wouldn't look into it?

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,240
I even found you.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,640
So finding people you had
contacted? Piece of cake.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,120
Why are you doing this to Fiat?

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm asking you!

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,120
Your boyfriend came on to me first.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,720
If he didn't seduce me, I wouldn't
have broken up with my boyfriend.

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,080
Leo, Tho said you've found
the person who filmed the clip.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,240
You.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,240
The gigolo who used to be with P' Chika.

25
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
EP.4: Got to take care of your own man

26
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,280
EP.4: Got to take care of your own man
You.

27
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,000
You.

28
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,200
The gigolo who used to be with P' Chika.

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Last year when I started
going clubbing, I met someone.

30
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,880
Sorry.

31
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,360
His name is P' Chika.

32
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,960
We meet again.
You came alone?

33
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,520
Yes.

34
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,480
You came alone too?

35
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah, I'm bored.

36
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Mind if I join you?

37
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
Go ahead.

38
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
You've been here long?

39
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,480
For a while.

40
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,480
After we'd become closer,
he took me clubbing.

41
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
- I trusted him.
- Thank you.

42
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,640
So I told him about you.

43
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,200
If it's so hard, why
don't you just give up?

44
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,040
See? There's plent of fish in the sea.

45
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,040
But there's only one Leo.

46
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
And it's not like I haven't tried.

47
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,800
I tried stopping myself from loving him.

48
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,480
But it hurt more than
when I still loved him.

49
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,760
I feel you.

50
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,960
I've also got a boyfriend.

51
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,760
Knowing that he's a scumbag,
I still can't break up with him.

52
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,040
If I catch him cheating
red-handed, it'll be easy to let go.

53
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
Speak of the devil.

54
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,240
Look.

55
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,200
Guess he's calling to ask for money again.

56
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,159
Hello?

57
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
What's the matter?

58
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,720
Not enough tuition fees
or your mom's hospitalized?

59
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,960
Fine, I'll wire you the money.

60
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,440
In the end...

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,440
...I always give in to him.

62
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Because no matter how bad he is,
the only thing I can't accept...

63
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,960
...is cheating.

64
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,920
If I see it with my own eyes once,
I'll probably stop being a fool.

65
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,920
I didn't think anything about it at first.

66
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Until...

67
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
Hey, what happened to you?

68
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,120
Why do I love such a bastard?

69
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,920
I can even order people to beat him up.

70
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,760
But I still let him do this to me.

71
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,640
Why?

72
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
It's okay.

73
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
Fiat.

74
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,559
Please help me.

75
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,800
Just this once.

76
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,240
I'm begging you.

77
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,840
It's okay, P' Chika.

78
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,280
Not anymore, I can't take it anymore.

79
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,160
When I approached him, he hit on me.

80
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,080
Took me to a hotel.

81
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,280
And tried to screw me too.

82
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,920
But luckily, P' Chika came in first.

83
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,640
He was so pitiful.

84
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,280
He was crying his eyes out,
you know that?

85
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,280
I also learned that he bought you
a condo and a car.

86
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,960
Paid for your tuition fees and everything.

87
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,000
But you used the money
to buy drugs and hookers.

88
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey, Leo!

89
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
You tried to fuck my boyfriend?

90
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,000
He's the one who seduced me.

91
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,120
Chika broke up with me because of him.

92
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,680
He took my condo and my car.

93
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,840
- He casted me out like a dog!
- It wasn't even your money.

94
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,600
They used to be mine, before you
poked your nose into my business.

95
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,200
Just you wait.

96
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,520
I won't take your father's money anymore.

97
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,080
But I'm gonna post the clip online!

98
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Let's see how a young master
like you will survive in the society.

99
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
If you think you can do it, go ahead.

100
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,600
- Let me go!
- Stay still.

101
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,560
You thugs! You'd better
not let me get away!

102
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,240
- I fucking said let go!
- Hey!

103
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,040
If you don't shut your hole...

104
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,440
...I can't guarantee when my
men's patience will run out.

105
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
Let's go.

106
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,240
Get in.

107
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,440
No funny business, okay?
Be obedient.

108
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,040
Without me, this matter wouldn't
have been settled. Right, bro?

109
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,520
What?

110
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,280
Don't worry, my men will
send him to the destination.

111
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,840
- Thanks.
- Sure.

112
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,040
- I'll go talk to them.
- Okay.

113
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,040
Bro.

114
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,440
That bastard shouldn't have taken
revenge on Fiat, don't you think?

115
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Now he's in hell for real.

116
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,160
If it's about Fiat, nobody can stop Leo.

117
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,040
Yeah, you're right.

118
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,960
By the way, did you know
which layer of hell is the deepest?

119
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,400
No idea, I've never died before.

120
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,440
Well, well, well. You're smart.

121
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,840
I'm leaving.

122
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,400
Bye bye. Let's go, boss.

123
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,360
Thanks for calling me.

124
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

125
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,240
And that bastard, I'll deal with him.

126
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,720
Will you be okay?

127
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,720
I've come to my senses.

128
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,880
Without him, I feel like
I've escaped hell.

129
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
But now.

130
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
I wanna give him hell.

131
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,320
After all, I've got to
take care of my own man.

132
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,320
And I'll take really good care of him.

133
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,680
By the way.

134
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,240
I guess I don't have
a drinking buddy anymore.

135
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
Right?

136
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,760
Well, yeah.

137
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,240
I probably won't drink with you anymore.

138
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
As you wish, you're
practically glued to each other.

139
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,480
Then I'll go deal with that bastard.

140
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,560
And I'll take care of the clip for you.

141
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,400
And take care good care of your own man.

142
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,280
Bye.

143
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,960
You sure you want it to end like this?

144
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,360
Yeah.

145
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,800
Trust me, I know P' Chika well.

146
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,680
When he saw that bastard
try to screw me...

147
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,720
...he was boiling with rage
and almost killed that bastard.

148
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh? What's with your expression?

149
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,880
I should've punched him one more time.

150
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,080
- You're jealous that he tried to screw me?
- Fiat.

151
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:00,000
Come on, didn't you say
you didn't care about my past?

152
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,880
That's right.

153
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,760
But there's no rule that stops me
from being jealous of your past men.

154
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,600
That bastard doesn't count.
I was only lending P' Chika a hand.

155
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
Yeah.

156
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,440
However.

157
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm relieved to know that I
didn't steal anyone's boyfriend.

158
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,080
And...

159
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,120
Trying to steal someone's
boyfriend once is enough.

160
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,000
If you keep making that face, then...

161
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,680
Come on, come upstairs with me.

162
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,440
- Where to?
- Just come.

163
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
What are you doing?

164
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,040
I won't be shy anymore.

165
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,600
It's not like me at all.

166
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Yeah, I was shy of you.

167
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,800
But I won't wait anymore.

168
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,520
Leo.

169
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,319
Let's do it.

170
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,080
But our conversation isn't over yet.

171
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,840
I must go talk to your dad about the clip.

172
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,920
I don't care about it.

173
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,680
I told you, you're the only one
who can do anything to me.

174
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,280
In any way you want.

175
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
Don't you want it?

176
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,400
Fiat, don't tempt me.

177
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm not.

178
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
I just want to be yours.

179
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,720
I can't hold back anymore.

180
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,320
Who told you to?

181
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll try to do better than the last time.

182
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
Just do whatever you want.

183
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,880
Leo.

184
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,920
I can't see your face.

185
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,400
Is this seat taken?

186
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,000
Mind if I join you?

187
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,400
My name's Leon, umm, Kitty Boy.

188
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,640
- That's not my name.
- Then tell me yours.

189
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,320
Wait.

190
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,800
I just wanna thank you for the umbrella.

191
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,280
Sure, don't mention it.

192
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
Wait!

193
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,280
Please let go.

194
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,360
I don't want any problems with your lovers.

195
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,600
Could you at least tell me your name?

196
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
Pob, my name is Pob.

197
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,400
P' Pob.

198
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,800
P' Pob.

199
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,600
Does it mean 'meet'...

200
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
...as in 'we finally meet'?

201
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,000
You okay?

202
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,240
Why do you have such great stamina?

203
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
I can see you smiling.

204
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,200
Oh yeah, Leo. Those twins are so scary.

205
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,040
Normally, I don't see Aek much.

206
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,880
As for Tho, I think he's silly and dirty.

207
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,000
I just found out today that
their dad is a big shot.

208
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,000
Aek said Tho doesn't like
handling things at home.

209
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,360
So Aek has to take care of everything.

210
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,160
So...

211
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,360
Do you want me to...

212
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,240
...improve anything?

213
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,440
Regarding...

214
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,400
Regarding this.

215
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,040
Crazy.

216
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,880
What a thing to ask!

217
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,600
You can be rougher.

218
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,600
That's how I like it.

219
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,040
We meet again, P' Pob.

220
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,040
Mind if I join you?

221
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,120
Suit yourself.

222
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,200
This is a cafeteria.
No need to ask for permission.

223
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,840
I've just found out that you're a senior.

224
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,240
I thought you were a year older than me.

225
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,640
Wait, P' Pob.

226
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,240
Let's have a meal together.

227
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,040
I've eaten.

228
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,920
No. I mean, let's eat
together some other time.

229
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
My treat.

230
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,000
To thank you for the umbrella.

231
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,440
I told you it's fine.

232
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,600
What a coincidence.

233
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,200
What's the rush?
Shall I give you a ride?

234
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,720
No, I can go on my own.

235
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,960
You escape, I pursue.

236
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,720
Gosh, I can't take it anymore.

237
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,960
P' Pob!

238
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,640
P' Pob!

239
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
P' Pob!

240
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,960
P' Pob.

241
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,240
- Umm, I...
- Pobphan.

242
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes, Professor?

243
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,360
I've reviewed your thesis.

244
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,280
You need to edit some parts.
Let's discuss it later.

245
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,360
Thank you very much, Professor.

246
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,960
Good afternoon.

247
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,560
P' Pob.

248
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Ummm... P' Pobphan.

249
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,040
I have to go to class.
Excuse me.

250
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,440
He's like a puppy.

251
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,520
Can't decide if he's cute or annoying.

252
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,000
But one thing for sure.

253
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,800
Pobjer is the cutest.

254
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,040
Right?

255
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,680
Hmm?

256
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,760
What's wrong?

257
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,720
You look like an abandoned puppy.

258
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,160
I've heard you've been hanging out
with a social work student.

259
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,680
Who told you?

260
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,920
You've attracted so much attention
that the whole campus knows you.

261
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
So there are a lot of
eyewitnesses wherever you go.

262
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,600
His name is P' Pob, a senior.

263
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,240
And?

264
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,400
Well...

265
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,040
I don't know.

266
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,960
If you ask me if he's cute, he is.

267
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,160
Cute in a weird way.

268
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,800
I don't know how to put it.

269
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,440
I guess he strikes my fancy.

270
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,280
- He may not like you.
- Woah.

271
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,600
I'm your lil' bro.

272
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,240
That's why I need to speak the truth.

273
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,680
Not everyone's going to like you.

274
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,880
I know that.
Your boyfriend's an example.

275
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,080
I don't like him too because
he's stealing your love from me.

276
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,040
So what's your plan?

277
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,840
Well...

278
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,320
Keep pestering him, I guess?

279
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,480
You never change.

280
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,240
Then, as your brother,
let me warn you.

281
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,560
You're self-centered.

282
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
At a time like this.

283
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,520
Try to be considerate.

284
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,800
You've become a guru
since you got a boyfriend.

285
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,640
But I'll remember it.

286
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,520
Here.

287
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,000
If you're only going to
stare at me, then leave.

288
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,080
You're anxious because the clip's owner
has disappeared, right?

289
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,440
What do you mean?

290
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,840
I know you're trying to find
the guy who did that to Fiat.

291
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,680
And handle it in your own way
to protect his reputation.

292
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,560
It's my family's reputation
that I'm trying to protect.

293
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,720
No, you're afraid he'll be sad.

294
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,600
What do you know, Leo?

295
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,080
I know you're protecting him from afar.

296
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,880
But wouldn't it be better to show him
that you worry about him too?

297
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,320
Someone once told me,
we can't change the past.

298
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,000
But if we come to terms with it,
we can create a better future.

299
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,560
I want a future with him.

300
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,960
What about you, Uncle?

301
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,080
You don't have to worry about
the clip because I've dealt with it.

302
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,200
But the one who can protect him
is actually you, not me.

303
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,320
Where's he gone?

304
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,560
What's this?

305
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,840
A gift, from your favorite shop.

306
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,600
Wow.

307
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,080
You're the sweetest.

308
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,440
You're the sweet one.

309
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,640
Don't be so sweet.

310
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,200
What? I'm not doing anything.

311
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
You're wrong.

312
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,760
Because I like seeing you smile like this.

313
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,960
It makes me happy.

314
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,920
Sheesh, what are you saying?

315
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,920
[Bon appétit, "Fay".]

316
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,720
What's this?

317
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,440
Actually, I went to your house.

318
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,480
And Auntie Fay asked me to give you this.

319
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,760
I'm going upstairs to do my report.
It's not finished yet.

320
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,320
Are you mad at me?

321
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,160
No.

322
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,320
If you're not, then why
did you return in your room?

323
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,480
I told you I needed to finish my report.

324
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,360
If you're mad about Auntie Fay,
I won't do it again.

325
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,480
I told you I'm not mad.

326
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,480
Please forgive me.

327
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,600
Please.

328
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,000
I told you I'm not mad.

329
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,760
Who's mad?

330
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,720
But you walked away from me.

331
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,680
Hey.

332
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,320
Fine, I was disappointed.

333
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,360
I thought you bought the cake for me.

334
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,600
But turned out you got it
from someone else.

335
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,040
So I felt embarrassed.

336
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
But I'm not mad, just sulking.

337
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,640
A little bit.

338
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,280
- A little bit?
- Yeah.

339
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,680
Hey, don't!

340
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,720
That's enough, you're being silly.

341
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,920
Are we cool now?

342
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,440
I told you I'm not mad.

343
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,000
Hello, P' Pob.

344
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,800
Wait, P' Pob. Don't go.

345
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,400
I need to talk to you.

346
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,000
About what?

347
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,320
Oh.

348
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,720
How's the cat doing?

349
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,960
When we first met,
I saw you take the cat with you.

350
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,520
So how's the kitty doing?

351
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,240
She's fine. She's growing very quickly.

352
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,760
You're raising her?

353
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Yeah.

354
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,360
What's her name?

355
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,080
Jer.

356
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,440
Pobjer.

357
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,080
Pobphan and Pobjer?

358
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,760
Yeah.

359
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,640
Cute.

360
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,200
She's very cute.
Wanna see her pictures?

361
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,160
Pobjer.

362
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,680
Well? Is she cute?

363
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,200
This one was taken when I found her.

364
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,800
Cute.

365
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,800
Yeah. There's another one.

366
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,800
She's really cute in this picture, look.

367
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,360
- Don't you think? Look.
- Yes, she's cute.

368
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,280
- Look at her eyes.
- Very cute.

369
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,760
Come on, P' Pob. It's just a coffee.
You should let me treat you.

370
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,520
Since it's just a coffee,
why should I let you treat me, Leon?

371
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,320
What's wrong?
What's with the weird look?

372
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,960
Because you finally said my name
and used informal pronoun with me.

373
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,880
P' Pob, let me give you a ride.

374
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
- It's okay.
- Please.

375
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,640
My dorm's just around the corner.

376
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,400
Please, let me give you a ride.

377
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,080
No.

378
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,640
Excuse me.

379
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,800
Hello, P' Leo.

380
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,760
That's weird, you're asking me to lunch.

381
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,960
Sure, I'm free.

382
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,920
I was going to give someone a ride.

383
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,320
But he just wouldn't let me.

384
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,800
P' Leo, your little brother's so pitiful.

385
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,360
Okay, see you.

386
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,160
- Leo?
- Yes, my big brother.

387
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,240
What's he like?

388
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,800
Why do you wanna
know about my brother?

389
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,840
No, it's nothing.

390
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,280
Then I'm leaving.

391
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,240
Must be my imagination.

392
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,120
So when will Mom be back?

393
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,920
Leon.

394
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,880
- Leon.
- Yes?

395
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,600
What's up with you?

396
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,920
It's nothing, P' Leo.

397
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,320
What was your question again?

398
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,800
Forget it, I'll get going now.

399
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,920
Will you stop by the gym?

400
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,840
Depends on my mood.

401
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,320
Must be my imagination.

402
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,000
Have you been waiting long?

403
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,040
Not long.

404
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,640
Enough to finish the cake.

405
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,760
I was going to buy it for you.

406
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,800
Well, well.

407
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,040
To apologize for before?

408
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,760
But looks like I'm too late.

409
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,360
It's okay, you can
buy me a drink instead.

410
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Hold on, aren't you in a
hurry to take me to the gym?

411
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,280
I'll drink it on the way.
The guys are gonna complain again.

412
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,840
One peach soda, please.

413
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,160
One iced Americano, please.

414
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,840
You're not the only one
who knows about my taste.

415
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,880
I also know what you like to eat.

416
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,280
Natsu, is the game schedule out?

417
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,120
Next week.

418
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,520
I've been telling you over and over again.
Why can't you remember?

419
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,640
Come on, Grumbling Auntie.
I'm only asking.

420
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,400
Go practice.

421
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,440
- P' Fiat, come with me.
- What?

422
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,960
- Just come. Come on.
- Let go!

423
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,760
Let me borrow the captain for a sec.
I'll return him soon.

424
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,240
- Let me go, you Dalmatian!
- Just come with me.

425
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,800
Where're you taking me?

426
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,520
Not gonna follow them?

427
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,520
Don't worry, they've
been at odds since young.

428
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,440
Either they're up to mischief
or Fiat's being harassed.

429
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,560
It's nothing, let's continue.

430
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
What?

431
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,040
- What's wrong with you?
- Well? Is my P' Pob cute?

432
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,520
So?

433
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,880
- Why are you so darn stupid?
- Oh?

434
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,680
- I really pity my bro.
- Leon, I'm older than you.

435
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,920
We were born on the same fucking year.
You're just months older.

436
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,720
I call you P' Fiat only because
you started school earlier.

437
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,880
I'm gonna tell Leo.

438
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,960
You snitch, do you even know
you're gonna lose your husband?

439
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,200
What do you mean?

440
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,560
Do you see P' Pob over there?

441
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,760
Besides having a pretty face
that I find beautiful...

442
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,920
...he's so nice that you
can't compare to him at all.

443
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,760
- Oh?
- He's kind to humans and animals.

444
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,160
When he smiles, he's super cute.

445
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,800
When he talks about cats,
he's super adorable.

446
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,040
When he uses informal pronoun,
my heart's touched.

447
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,720
Comparing to you...

448
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,280
Stop it, you're clearing picking at me.

449
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,000
What's wrong with you?

450
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,120
And what's it got to do with Leo?

451
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,280
This guy I'm talking about likes P' Leo.

452
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,680
- Huh, what?
- Be quiet, you idiot!

453
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,000
Don't be so loud.
He'll hear you.

454
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,040
Where are you going?

455
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,240
I'm gonna go tell your P' Pob
that Leo's already got me.

456
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,200
- Stop it.
- Why?

457
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,680
What you should do isn't
proclaiming your status...

458
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,360
...but controlling your own man.

459
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,040
Can you really harm
such a nice guy like him?

460
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,400
- You're a total bastard.
- Hey, Leon!

461
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,760
Then what do you want me to do?

462
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,560
Listen, you must thoroughly
control your own man.

463
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:26,880
Whether it's on a cabinet, a table,
a bed, a chair, or at a balcony.

464
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,400
Show all your tricks.
Get what I mean?

465
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,120
Believe me.

466
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,720
Show him everything you've got.

467
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,120
Hold him tight, squeeze him.

468
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,200
Until he's completely dry on the bed.

469
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,440
I don't think you're up to it.

470
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,640
Need some help?

471
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,360
Stay out of this, I can handle
my boyfriend on my own.

472
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,120
Just take care of your P' Pob.

473
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,600
Fine, deal.

474
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
Deal.
