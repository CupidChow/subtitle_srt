1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,560
Leo, hurry up! I've got an
appointment with the professor.

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,360
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
Fiat, don't you remember?

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,480
Ahh!

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,879
Are you okay?

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,840
Who are you?

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,120
Leo.

8
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,880
She's my mom.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
How have you been?

10
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
EP.8: Broken memories

11
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,360
What's the matter, Mom?

12
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,280
Did you forget?

13
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
You must have only me.

14
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,520
You must love only me.

15
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,360
You've forgotten me.

16
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,720
Fiat, you've really forgotten me.

17
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,480
No, Mom. I haven't forgotten you.

18
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,280
You didn't listen to me.

19
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,440
You forgot what I taught you.

20
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
You must love only me.

21
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,680
You must hate everyone.

22
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,920
You must love only me!

23
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,200
Fiat.

24
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
You had a nightmare?

25
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,760
I... I dreamed about my
mom when I was young.

26
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,800
I don't know what she said.
I can't remember.

27
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,760
It's okay, we're going
to meet her anyway.

28
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,200
You probably dreamed about her
because you met her today.

29
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,680
But Leo.

30
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,920
Why did she come to see me?

31
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,840
I haven't seen her since I was four.

32
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,520
Why did she suddenly
come back to me?

33
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,640
I don't get it!

34
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
Calm down.

35
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,360
She probably wanted to see you,
just like how you wanted to see her.

36
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
I don't know.

37
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,400
I thought I'd be happier.

38
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,120
But why do I feel so uneasy?

39
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,640
It's probably because you
haven't seen her in a long time.

40
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
Right now, get some sleep.

41
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
Stop thinking.

42
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,360
Let's talk tomorrow.

43
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,560
Okay?

44
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,720
Okay.

45
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,040
I know, I forgot some stuff at
my dad's home, so I came back.

46
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, I'll be in time
for the presentation.

47
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,200
I found it.

48
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,040
I'll have Leo drive faster,
so buy me some time.

49
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Fiat, Nong Fiat.

50
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,159
Please take these sandwiches.

51
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,000
There's Leo's portion too.
Eat while you're on the road.

52
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,760
Umm...

53
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,160
Sorry, I guess I'm being too meddlesome.

54
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,480
You don't hate me?

55
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
No.

56
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
Why would I hate you?

57
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,039
Thank you.

58
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,760
You're supposed to be happy, Fiat!
You finally get to talk to your mom.

59
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,560
I shouldn't have been cocky.

60
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,680
Should've asked
you to stay with me.

61
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,840
Are you sure you're going in alone?

62
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,600
She's my mom.
What's there to be afraid of?

63
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm not saying your mom's scary.

64
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm just worried.

65
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,920
I can do it alone.

66
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
Besides.

67
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:19,160
She'll be shocked to see her son
bringing a burly man as a bodyguard.

68
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm okay.

69
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm just a little nervous.

70
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,280
I haven't seen her in ages.

71
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,560
There's so much I
wanna talk to her about.

72
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
But I don't know where to start.

73
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,160
Then call me when you're done.

74
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,440
I'll pick you up.

75
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,760
Okay.

76
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
I'll call you when I'm done.

77
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,280
Have you been waiting long?

78
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,200
Umm...

79
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,840
I've just arrived.

80
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
You seem tense.

81
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,920
Fiat.

82
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,680
Are you mad at me that
I just came to you now?

83
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,360
I...

84
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm not mad at you.

85
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,280
I was just surprised.

86
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm sorry.

87
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I...

88
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,120
It's okay, Son.

89
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Well...

90
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,120
This is my fault, I was too rush.

91
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,360
When we've only just met.

92
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,920
It's a given that you'll feel
uncomfortable to see this terrible mother.

93
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,480
No, Mom.
I don't feel that way.

94
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm not angry with you.

95
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,200
I've always wanted to meet you.

96
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,600
You're not angry that I left you?

97
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,240
You may not believe
what I'm going to say.

98
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,920
But I never wanted to leave you.

99
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:14,040
And not a single day goes by that
I don't regret doing as that man said.

100
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,680
You mean Dad?

101
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,920
Your father...

102
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,880
...chose that woman instead of me.

103
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
So I had to leave.

104
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,240
I've been wanting to come see
you this whole time, but I couldn't.

105
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,600
He forbade me to approach you.

106
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,200
And he kept an eye on me all the time.

107
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,840
But I wanted to meet my son.

108
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,840
I've always wanted to tell you
that I never wanted to leave you.

109
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,600
And why did you only come now?

110
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,480
I've just learned
that you've moved out.

111
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,600
So I sneaked out to come see you.

112
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,360
Besides.

113
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,000
He doesn't care about you anymore.

114
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,800
He lets that woman live in the house.

115
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,360
Has a child with her.

116
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
He kicked you out
the same way he did to me.

117
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,280
He didn't kick me out, Mom.

118
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,840
But he doesn't care.

119
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,680
Right, Son?

120
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,560
He's still selfish.

121
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,280
Cares only about himself.

122
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,600
And doesn't care about our feelings at all.

123
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
But I...

124
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,960
I guess I'm no better than him.

125
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,640
You can be angry with me or hate me.

126
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,760
But can I come see you again?

127
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,440
Please?

128
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,000
P' Pob.

129
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,000
You won't see any missed
calls, 'cause I didn't call you.

130
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,880
Then why did you come here?
Do you need something?

131
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,680
No, I just wanna pick you up.

132
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,840
Why is that?

133
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,480
I can just walk to my faculty from here.

134
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,680
Don't you really understand?

135
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,520
I like you, so it's a given
that I wanna see you.

136
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,600
Talking on the phone
and texting aren't enough.

137
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,760
Don't you care about me at all?

138
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,200
My heart hurts.

139
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,040
See? You don't care about me at all.

140
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,560
If I didn't care...

141
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,760
...I wouldn't have let you kiss me.

142
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,320
Come with me if you want.
Just don't trip yourself again.

143
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
I won't trip myself.

144
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Because I...

145
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
...have tripped over love.

146
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,760
We're lucky it was just a tune-up game.

147
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,520
If we lost the first game,
it wouldn't end well.

148
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,640
But if they can't solve the problem,
the result will be the same anyway.

149
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,440
Then use your killing slap again.

150
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,320
May I hold your hand?

151
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,440
Are you crazy?
There're people here.

152
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,640
An, come on.

153
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,440
- Want me to carry your bag?
- No.

154
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,640
How are you, my handsome Nong Leon?

155
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,000
Haven't seen you at the gym lately.

156
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,440
Is he the famous P' Pob?

157
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,560
I've been busy following
the famous P' Pob around.

158
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,800
He's so cute, I can't let
anyone steal him from me.

159
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,720
What are you saying?
Why am I famous?

160
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Everyone's curious about
who Nong Leon's pursuing.

161
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,120
So, are P' Pob and Leon...

162
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,080
I thought you were in a hurry.

163
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,520
We won't bother you anymore, Leon.
See you later, P' Pob.

164
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,720
See you.

165
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,840
Bye.

166
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,240
I didn't say anything.

167
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,120
P' Nat and P' An must be
thinking that we're dating.

168
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
But we're not.

169
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,000
I know that.

170
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,600
But it hurts when you said it out loud.

171
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,600
Leo.

172
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,920
What's with him?

173
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,600
Nothing, he's stressed
out about his report.

174
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,480
Really?

175
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,000
Nothing to do with last time?

176
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeah, it's nothing.

177
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,400
If you say so.

178
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,880
But I bet there's something going on.

179
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,040
What's wrong?

180
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,240
I don't know, I feel uneasy!
I don't wanna think about it!

181
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,640
- I don't know!
- What did you talk to her about?

182
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,120
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna think about it anymore.

183
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,360
Why?

184
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,920
Can I not tell you?

185
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,520
I wanna forget everything.

186
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
My dad.

187
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
My mom.

188
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,640
Everything.

189
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,600
I don't wanna think.

190
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,960
I don't wanna know
why I was abandoned.

191
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,600
Listen to me, I'll never leave you.

192
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
You mean it?

193
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,600
If you need reassurance,
I'll give it to you.

194
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,880
But...

195
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
There are people in the locker room.

196
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,400
Leo, please.

197
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,160
Then...

198
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,760
Keep your voice down.

199
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,720
Oh?

200
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,680
Where are P' Fiat and P' Leo?

201
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,680
Why do you wanna know?

202
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,440
Come on, they told us to practice hard.

203
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,080
So they should at least
treat us to a meal.

204
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,720
I think they're in the shower.

205
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,320
I don't think they're just having a shower.

206
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,080
What should I do?

207
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,800
I was gonna take a shower,
but I think I'd better leave now.

208
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,320
Oh, that's right.

209
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,080
Why don't you treat me instead?

210
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,080
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.

211
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,000
- Come on, let's not wait.
- You really.

212
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,960
Fine, I don't wanna risk riling Leo too.

213
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,720
Come on, let's go.

214
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,920
How do you feel?
Are you okay?

215
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,440
Is there anything you want to say?

216
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,360
No, there isn't.

217
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,280
You can tell anyone that
there's nothing wrong or you're fine.

218
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,840
But I want you to be honest with me.

219
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,560
Well...

220
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,240
I don't know where to start.

221
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,120
It's okay, take your time.

222
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,920
As long as you don't keep it to
yourself and make that kind of face.

223
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,560
I know my dad doesn't like me.

224
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,640
But I had no idea he hated me so much
that he wouldn't let me see my mom.

225
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,600
He doesn't hate you.

226
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,000
He knew all along that
I wanted to see my mom.

227
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,960
If he doesn't hate me and
my mom, why did he do that?

228
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,600
Then why don't you try
getting candid with him?

229
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,000
He never listens to me.

230
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,080
All he's ever cared
about is Fa and her mom.

231
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,640
He never cares about me!

232
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,960
If he didn't care about you...

233
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,960
...he wouldn't have stopped
you from leaving his sight.

234
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
He's afraid to lose you.

235
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,480
That's why he forced
you to do many things.

236
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,160
Then why did he do that to my mom?

237
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,680
I only had my mom.

238
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,720
There was only her who'd be with me.

239
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,640
You can't escape if you
want to know the truth.

240
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,000
You must talk to him.

241
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,520
Come here, you still have me.

242
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,600
Jer.

243
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,000
Leon, something's wrong with Jer.

244
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,000
I don't know what to do!

245
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,400
At the last visit.

246
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,760
The doctor said Jer has feline leukemia.

247
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,160
Is it treatable?

248
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,800
No, it's an incurable disease.

249
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,200
We can only give her
symptomatic treatment.

250
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,720
But the doctor also said
if we took good care of her...

251
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,040
...she'd live long.

252
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,040
It was supposed to be like that.

253
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,120
But I didn't know at all
that she had severe anemia.

254
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,600
She's in the doctor's hands now.
She's gonna be fine.

255
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm scared, Leon.

256
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm scared that I'd lose her
like I lost my father.

257
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,400
When I found Pobjer.

258
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,720
She was so small.

259
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,480
And very weak.

260
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,040
So I named her Pobjer,
just like Pobphan.

261
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,480
It was such a wonderful
feeling when I took her in.

262
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,000
It might not be the same, but...

263
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,600
I think I understand
my father's feelings.

264
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,639
I don't want anything
to happen to her.

265
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
I want to see her live a happy life.

266
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,639
Without being abandoned
like when her mom did to her.

267
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,199
She's gonna be okay.

268
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,600
She'll be fine.

269
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,280
Thank you for staying with me today.

270
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,320
And sorry for suddenly calling you.

271
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,360
It's okay, P' Pob.

272
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,760
You can always call me
if anything happens.

273
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,440
But now.

274
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,720
You need to rest.

275
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,080
Can you not leave tonight?

276
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,440
Will you stay over?

277
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,360
Can you sleep?

278
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,040
Absolutely, I can sleep anywhere.

279
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,920
Especially sleeping like this.

280
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,320
Earlier when I told you about Jer.

281
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,040
I felt like I was talking about myself.

282
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,920
Abandoned by my mother.

283
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
Lived a difficult life.

284
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,240
And got adopted.

285
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,680
But I'm luckier than Jer
because I've always been healthy.

286
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,320
So my father didn't
have to worry about it.

287
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,840
You must have really
loved your adoptive father.

288
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,640
Very much.

289
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,800
I loved him very much.

290
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,960
When he passed away, I felt lost.

291
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,120
I didn't know what to do.

292
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Which direction to take.

293
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,720
What I was supposed to do next.

294
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,280
But I held on to my father's words.

295
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,920
I want to fulfil my father's dream
of helping people in need.

296
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,360
I want to do what my father did.

297
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,040
Including giving me
the umbrella and cold towel?

298
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,920
That time, I did out of pity.

299
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
Then...

300
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,920
This pitiful guy is asking
this good boy to sleep.

301
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:54,000
Or this kitty might turn into a lion
that could devour you anytime.

302
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,800
You won't do it.

303
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,360
Because you never do
anything against my will.

304
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,960
Now I don't know what
to do after you said that.

305
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,040
In my whole life.

306
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,440
Besides my family, I've
never lain still next to anyone.

307
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,360
Especially not...

308
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,440
...sleeping while holding hands like this.

309
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,360
Thank you for staying with me.

310
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,680
I don't want to be alone right now.

311
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,600
It makes me miss my father.

312
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,040
Don't trust me too much.

313
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,280
I don't know how much
longer I can hold back.

314
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,080
Who would believe that
someone like Leon can lie still?

315
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,800
Guess I'm only like this to you.

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,240
What is it?

329
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,560
I want to ask you something.

330
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,160
Go ahead.

331
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,720
I wanna know about Mom.

332
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,760
You went to see her?

333
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,760
Whether I went to see her or not...

334
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,080
- ...it doesn't concern you.
- It does!

335
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,280
Because I'm your father!

336
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,760
Yes, you're my father, but you've got
no right to stop me from seeing her.

337
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,280
So you really did go see her.

338
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,560
I forbid you to see your mother again!

339
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,360
You've got no right to stop me!

340
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,240
You can bring anyone home.

341
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,640
Whether it's your new wife or daughter.
That's your business!

342
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,800
But you've got no right to
stop me from seeing Mom.

343
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,480
- She's my mother!
- It's because you know nothing at all!

344
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,080
Then tell me so I can understand!

345
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,200
I forbid you from meeting
your mother again.

346
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,080
Go ahead if you think you can stop me.

347
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,440
Fiat.

348
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,360
Fiat! Fiat!

349
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,120
Fiat.

350
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,560
Please calm down and listen to Mait.
He has his reasons.

351
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,960
Reasons?

352
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,640
You mean his selfishness that
made him bring you to this house?

353
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,000
It's not like that.

354
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,480
Then tell me that you're not
the reason I don't have a mom.

355
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,440
You can hate me, Fiat.

356
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,840
You can think that I'm the one
who broke your family apart.

357
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,920
But please don't hate Mait.
He loves you so much.

358
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,320
Love?

359
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,840
You call this love?

360
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,160
He loves me by kicking me out
of the house when I was young?

361
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,400
By never caring about me?
By never knowing how I feel?

362
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,400
But Mait never had any
intention to drive you away.

363
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,000
Don't make Mommy cry!

364
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,000
Fa, don't.

365
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,160
Don't do that to your brother.

366
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,840
Why? P' Fiat's bullying you again!

367
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,200
Grandma said you fell down
once because he pushed you.

368
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,920
I almost wasn't born.

369
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,400
He upsets Daddy and
makes Mommy cry.

370
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,400
So why do I have to love him?

371
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,600
What do you mean?
I never did such thing.

372
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,880
What did you say to Fa?

373
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,840
Well?

374
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,840
The day...

375
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,320
The day you found out I was pregnant.

376
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,000
Do you remember?

377
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,080
You pushed me down,
and I almost miscarried.

378
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,840
When Mait chased you off,
he didn't mean to kick you out.

379
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,200
Mait was frightened,
and so was I.

380
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,080
By the time we realized
that you'd left the house...

381
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,360
...we were already at the hospital.

382
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,600
We never thought of chasing you away.

383
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,640
Mait was even afraid that you'd hate him!

384
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,000
You're lying.

385
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,000
I...

386
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,840
...pushed you down?

387
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,840
And almost made you miscarry?

388
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,360
We're sorry.

389
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,760
We didn't look for you right away.

390
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,560
But when Mait knew that
Fa was out of danger...

391
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,440
...he immediately rushed
to Mr. Korn's house.

392
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,440
But Mr. Korn said we should let
you stay with Leo for a while.

393
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,280
I'm sorry.

394
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,400
I'm sorry for making your and Mait's
relationship turn out like this.

395
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,040
I'm the one who hurt them.

396
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,480
It's always been me.

397
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,040
I should've gone with him.

398
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,680
Don't know what's going to
happen when he talks to Uncle Mait.

399
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,080
[Auntie Fay]

400
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,240
Yes, Auntie Fay?

401
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,120
What did you say?
Fiat's disappeared from home?

402
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,040
Please calm down.
I'll be there right away.

403
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm the one who hurt them.

404
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,760
It's been me all along.

405
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,120
Dammit!

406
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,760
Fiat, I've been looking for you.

407
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,960
Leo!

408
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,560
I almost killed my own sister.

409
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,960
I'm a murderer.

Fiat.

423
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,080
Don't do this again.

424
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,520
Don't disappear without telling me again.

425
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:11,440
Do you know how I felt when
Auntie Fay said you were gone?

426
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,560
You didn't even take your car.

427
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,760
I was worried sick.

428
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,840
I was afraid you'd disappear.

429
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,720
I'm sorry.

430
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,040
It's okay, I'm not angry.

431
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,320
I was just afraid that you'd disappear.

432
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,240
You're not angry with me?

433
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,600
But I almost killed my sister.

434
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,120
I knew nothing at all!

435
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:05,680
All I know is my dad kicked me out,
so I ran away to your house.

436
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,200
And he didn't care about me at all.

437
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,880
But it turns out...

438
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,320
...he was at the
hospital with Auntie Fay.

439
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,560
I only thought about myself.

440
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,440
What a piece of shit.

441
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,360
I almost killed my sister.

442
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,840
You were young, you didn't
even know what was going on.

443
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,800
But I pushed a pregnant woman!

444
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,040
No matter how much I hated her,
I had no right to push her.

445
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,520
I almost killed her!
I almost killed my sister!

446
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,440
I pushed a pregnant woman.
I almost killed a person!

447
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,080
Fiat.

448
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,200
Calm down, take a deep breath.

449
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,600
No wonder...

450
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,880
...my dad hates me so much.

451
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,440
And so does everyone else.

452
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,440
But I never hate you.

453
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,800
Listen to me.
You were young back then.

454
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,800
You didn't mean to do it.

455
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,200
No one wanted it to happen.

456
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,920
And now Fa's safe and sound.

457
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,480
If you feel guilty.

458
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,200
Then be a good brother
to Fa from now on.

459
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,200
But she doesn't think of
me as her brother at all.

460
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,560
Someone once said to me.

461
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,160
'You can't do it or you won't?'

462
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,720
Fiat.

463
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,480
You can do it.

464
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,120
But you must open up.

465
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,480
To Uncle Mait.

466
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,520
To Auntie Fay.

467
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,160
And to Fa.

468
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,960
But how can I do it?

469
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,320
When Dad and Auntie Fay...

470
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,760
...kicked my mom out.

471
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,120
That's my mom.

472
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,440
They even forbade her from seeing me.

473
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,560
I don't know what
your mom told you.

474
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,680
But do you believe her?

475
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,880
That's my mom.

476
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,480
It's okay, I get it.

477
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,920
It's okay.

478
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,960
I'm waiting outside.

479
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,480
Wait a sec, I'll meet you there.

480
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,960
What's up, bro?

481
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,360
What's someone like you
doing at the library?

482
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,240
Someone like you knows
what I'm doing here.

483
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,440
Did you confess?
Want me to film the moment?

484
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,040
And tell the whole campus, right?

485
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,040
Isn't it good?

486
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,320
Stake your claim so that
no one will approach him.

487
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,480
Even without a clip, no one
will dare touch him anyway.

488
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,680
So, this means you and P' Pob are...

489
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,840
Have you been waiting long?

490
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,320
So what's your answer?

491
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,520
Or should I ask him?

492
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,720
Mind your own business.

493
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,960
Good luck, bro.

494
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,880
I'll share this good
news to your P' Fiat.

495
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,320
P' Fiat's not mine.
He belongs to my big brother.

496
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,840
Get it right.

497
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,120
Your friend?

498
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,800
No, P' Fiat's friend.

499
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
We play basketball
together sometimes.

500
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,680
Oh P' Pob, if you see
P' Nam again, don't talk to him.

501
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,360
He's notorious for his love of pranks.

502
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,440
Do you know what his motto is?

503
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,600
'Amusement above all else.
Nothing else matters.'

504
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,160
You'll get pranked if
you talk to him often.

505
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,720
Does it mean you got pranked earlier?

506
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,440
No.

507
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,480
Then don't worry too much.

508
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,440
Actually, he asked me
about our relationship.

509
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,760
And I couldn't bear to answer that
we're only senior and junior.

510
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,680
Then next time you see him,
tell him we're dating.

511
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,880
Huh? What did you say?

512
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,640
The elevator's here.

513
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,040
P' Pob, what did you say?
What do you mean?

514
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,920
Talk to me.

515
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,960
Fiat! Fia...

516
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,760
I told you, you can't come in.

517
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,200
Why? I'm here to see my son!

518
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,120
But you can't just
barge into my house.

519
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,840
And why can't I?

520
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,160
Fiat is my son, so I have every right!

521
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,040
He doesn't need you.
I'm all he needs.

522
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,120
Let me go!

523
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,840
Fiat!

524
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,880
- Fiat.
- Fiat.

525
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,680
Calm down.

526
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,760
I'm here.

527
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,680
Fiat.

528
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,360
You're the only one I love.

529
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,120
I'm all you need.

530
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,040
Your dad doesn't love me anymore.

531
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,960
He doesn't love you too.

532
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,400
Because you're my son.

533
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,680
Nobody wants you like I do.

534
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,520
I have only you, so you
must have only me, okay?

535
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,600
Okay?

536
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,360
Please.

537
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,320
I told you, didn't I?

538
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,960
Your dad doesn't care about you anymore.
So why do you care about him!

539
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,960
Nobody loves you but me.

540
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,040
Understand?

541
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,160
Only listen to me!

542
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,760
Only listen to me.
Why can't you remember that!

543
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,320
You must hate every
woman around your dad.

544
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,600
Because they're the
reason I can't be with you.

545
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,800
You must hate everyone, understand?

546
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,680
I don't want to hate
anyone. I love Daddy.

547
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,680
But he doesn't love you.

548
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,120
Listen to what I say!

549
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,800
Listen!

550
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,640
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Listen to me! Listen!

551
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,680
Where are you going?
Get back here! Listen!

552
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,920
Nobody loves you but me, understand?

553
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,400
You understand?

554
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,880
Oh baby, don't cry.

555
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,920
Don't cry, good boy.

556
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,760
Remember what I say.

557
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,520
You must hate everyone.

558
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,240
But me.

559
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,920
Keep this in mind.

560
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,720
Time to sleep.

561
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,200
Close your eyes.

562
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,120
You must hate everyone.

563
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,560
Keep this in mind.

564
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,640
I remember now.

565
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,120
You told me to hate everyone.

566
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,600
That's right.

567
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,840
You've finally remembered.

568
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,880
All you need is me,
and that's enough.

569
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,520
Come to me.

570
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,920
Fiat.

571
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,920
Come to Mommy.

572
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,440
Come on.

573
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,000
Come on, Fiat.

574
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,399
Bro.

575
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,120
What?

576
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,760
We've had less airtime
lately, don't you think?

577
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,640
It's because Fiat and Leo
rarely hang out with us.

578
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,240
Bro, what will become of
a crocodile whose tail is cut off?

579
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:52,600
It'll become injured.

580
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,040
Oh?

581
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,520
Bro, how about a spoonerism joke?
Wanna hear it?

582
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,760
Bro!
