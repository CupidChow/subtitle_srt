1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,880
What did you say?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,960
I've looked into the incident
this little shit told me about.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,560
King and Punn team up
to screw with your heads.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,520
You were drugged
the day Leo met you at the bar.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,720
Damn, that's why you kept barfing
when you stayed at my place.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,880
Now that you know it,
what are you gonna do?

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,360
If he doesn't wanna see
me anymore, I'll back down.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,760
But if he still does,
I'm gonna get my man back.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,360
That's what I'm talking about!
We're here for this reason.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,880
Tonight, we'll be your bodyguards.

11
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
EP.12: When our hearts are close

12
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,200
Fiat.

13
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,960
Who do you think he'll choose?

14
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,720
Fiat, wait.

15
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,520
P' Leo, where are you going?

16
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,000
Your role ends here.

17
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,360
And I think we need to talk.

18
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Move.

19
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,120
We won't stand in your way.
We just wanna say...

20
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,600
Don't let him go this time.

21
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,000
Your favorite son
sure draws attention.

22
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,800
As expected of Fiat.

23
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,600
That's the boy I raised
with my own hands.

24
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,280
You seem proud of yourself.

25
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
Of course.

26
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,080
Seeing the star of
the party chase after him...

27
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,680
...now we know who's the real winner.

28
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,159
Then why don't we hold an event
to announce their relationship?

29
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,560
You know me so well.
You're the best.

30
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
How could I not know?

31
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Thutanukul men are all alike.

32
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,880
We want to indulge the people we love.

33
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,160
Thank you.

34
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,880
Fiat.

35
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
Why are you crying?

36
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,800
Do you know?

37
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,480
When I challenged that woman,
I wasn't confident at all...

38
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,280
...that you'd choose me or follow me.

39
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,640
I kept thinking that
you wouldn't choose me.

40
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,280
What would I do if that happened?

41
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,520
You know that you're the
most important person in my life.

42
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,400
I was unsure.

43
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,240
Ever since you said you couldn't
bare to look at me, I've been at a loss.

44
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,840
Fiat.

45
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,559
I don't even know if I should be here.

46
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,320
You said you didn't wanna see my face.

47
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,880
So we should go back to being friends.

48
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,520
But Leo, I couldn't stand it.

49
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,080
Couldn't stand to see you
leave with someone else.

50
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,080
I love you, I really do.

51
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,320
I promise you'll be
the only one for me.

52
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
There'll be no one else.

53
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
Don't leave me.

54
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,440
I really can't stand the thought
of being just friends with you.

55
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm sorry.

56
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,040
I can't stand to be
just friends with you too.

57
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,600
I told my brother.

58
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,040
That I'm willing to be your friend or
anything, as long as I can be by your side.

59
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,760
But it's not what I want at all.

60
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,640
I don't want to see you smile at anyone.

61
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,560
Don't want to see you kiss anyone.

62
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,840
Don't want you to love anyone but me.

63
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,200
Don't want you to love anyone but me.

But didn't you say you
couldn't bear to look at my face?

70
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,880
Because I was afraid I'd hurt you.

71
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,600
You've never hurt me.

72

heart that could harm you at any time.

...that I want you to be only mine.

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,160
You can do it.

82
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,840
You can lock me up.

83
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,000
Tie me up.

84
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,040

Let go of me.

111
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,760
You think you can do anything
just because you're P' Leo's friends?

112
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,560
What did we do?
We didn't anything.

113
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,840
More like, what did you do?

114
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,680
What do you mean, P' An?
I didn't do anything.

115
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Aek, what do you think?

116
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,760
Do you know a guy named King?

117
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,680
No.

118
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,760
Really?

119
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,800
But you met him at your aunt's
new brand launch three months ago.

120
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
You were even pictured together.

121
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,080
And I've heard you've gotten
close and often met with him.

122
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,760
Yeah, surprisingly often.

123
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,320
And what's that got
to do with you guys?

124
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,560
We wouldn't have cared
if you hadn't messed with our friends.

125
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,200
That's why I'm asking,
what did I do?

126
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,960
Finally! I got it.

127
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,200
I think you aren't just on friendly terms,
but physically intimate.

128
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,680
With the hugging, kissing,
groping, and all that.

129
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
And in a public place of all places.

130
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,000
Seriously, weren't you
afraid of being seen?

131
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,760
If you still don't know what you did...

132
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,079
...then we also don't know
what's gonna happen after this.

133
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,760
I'll have it back.

134
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,720
You're messing with the wrong man.

135
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,800
You're messing with the wrong man.
Wanna harm my friend?

136
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,920
If the whole campus knew about
Fiat's love confession last time...

137
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,880
...this time, I'll let every
university know who Nong Punn is.

138
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,960
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna take me to Mom?

139
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,480
Why are you almost naked?

140
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,560
You're crazy, I'm fully clothed.

141
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,680
Does it have to be this revealing?

142
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,480
Why? You don't like it?

143
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,960
Mom bought it for me.

144
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,040
It's so revealing that
I can even put my hand inside.

145
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
There're people here!

146
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,000
So?

147
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,480
Fine, that's enough! I got it!

148
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,760
You said I could be possessive.

149
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,400
So, can I punish you?

150
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,720
Yes.

151
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,720
Then let's go see Mom
after I burn this outfit.

152
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,720
What a jealous man.

153
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,200
Yeah, I'm jealous.
Prepare to endure my jealousy.

154
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,880
My brother's the best.

155
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,680
I miss P' Pob.

156
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,720
Looks like someone's
been reading my mind.

157
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,560
Yes, P' Pob.

158
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Yes? Where are you?

159
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,600
Yes, okay. I'll be down now.

160
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,760
P' Pob, how did you get here?
You should have...

161
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Are you busy, Leon?
Do you have a moment?

162
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,080
Are you crying?

163
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,840
I have something to tell you.

164
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,120
Do you remember what I told you?

165
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,520
That my dream is to help
underprivileged children?

166
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,080
Yes, you looked so happy
when you told me about it.

167
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,760
Before I met Pobjer.

168
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,600
I applied for field work
at an underdeveloped area.

169
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,480
But I didn't keep track of the result.

170
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
I got an email.

171
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,880
I got the job.

172
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,320
This field job is located
in Thailand, right?

173
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,080
No, not in Thailand.

174
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
When are you leaving?

175
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,440
Next week.

176
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,360
Why so sudden?

177
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,960
They urgently need people.

178
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,520
Citizens are emigrating due to
escalating economic problems.

179
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,200
The children are
starving and homeless.

180
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,280
And...

181
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,160
They want someone
who's ready to work.

182
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,920
Well...

183
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,360
I submitted my thesis
and talked to the professor.

184
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,960
I'm considered a graduate now.

185
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,320
And I won't stay for
the graduation ceremony.

186
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,240
You're only telling me now
after you've dealt with everything?

187
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,240
I'm sorry.

188
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,480
So what do you want me to do?

189
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,280
Congratulate you for getting a job?

190
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,560
Congratulate you
for fulfilling your dream?

191
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,000
And congratulate myself
for getting dumped?

198

But my dream is to help people in need.

Yes.

And the trickiest one too.

228
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,520
You just tell me you love me.

229
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,640
On the day you're
breaking up with me.

230
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,040
You're the trickiest man ever.

231
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm sorry, I really am.

232
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,280
I'm sorry, Leon.

233
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,600
I'm sorry.

234
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,560
Don't take it off.

235
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,560
You love it when I wear this outfit?

236
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,440
Yeah, so don't take it off.

237
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,520
Can I at least take off the suit?

238
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,560
Beautiful.

239
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,720
No, I'm handsome.

240
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,040
No.

241
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,040
Everything about you is beautiful.

242
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,800
And you're the most handsome man ever.

243
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
I heard from Mom.

244
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,840
What did she tell you?

245
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,360
She said she saw you and
P' Pob hugging and crying.

246
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,520
So she guessed something happened.

247
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,120
Do you have anything
to tell your brother?

248
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,200
You know that I need you, P' Leo.

249
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,480
And I'll always do anything for you.

250
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,600
You once said you cared about P' Fiat
so much that you'd do anything for him.

251
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,920
I used to wonder why
my brother was so stupid.

252
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,720
If you love someone, then
you should make them yours.

253
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,560
But now.

254
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,320
I realized.

255
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,960
Because we love them so much.

256
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
Care about them so much.

257
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,040
That we can't be selfish
and force them to stay.

258
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,680
P' Pob doesn't wanna crush my dream.

259
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,200
And I don't wanna shatter his.

260
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,080
I like...

261
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,040
I love P' Pob the way he is.

262
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:25,920
I don't wanna turn him
into someone I want him to be.

263
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,560
Do you know how long I've loved Fiat?

264
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
Your whole life.

265
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,480
And how long had I waited for him?

266
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,440
Your whole life.

267
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,560
Yes, I can wait.

268
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,080
Even if it takes my whole life.

269
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,040
What about you?

270
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,760
It may not be today or tomorrow.

271
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,440
But if you still love him,
the right time for you will come.

272
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,120
It's up to you whether
you can wait for him or not.

273
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,760
But I don't know when he'll be back.

274
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,840
Then make the most of
the time you have left.

275
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,920
Keep him in your memory.

276
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,200
Engrave it here.

277
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,560
I understand that you can't
take it if you can't be by his side.

278
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,080
But you won't be able to take it even more
if you become the one who hurts him.

279
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Even if it's the last time...

280
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,720
...make him happy.

281
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,480
The men in our family are so silly.

282
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,440
We just put their happiness...

283
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,160
...before our own.

284
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,520
Thank you, P' Leo.

285
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,120
I'm so curious about the locker
room's atmosphere right now.

286
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,800
I bet it's hyped up.

287
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Since King knows that
we've dealt with Nong Punn.

288
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,360
How's it, bro?
It's all my friend's doing.

289
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,680
So let's consider all is forgiven.

290
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,360
Hold on, I was the one
who did everything.

291
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,960
You guys only edited and posted the clip.

292
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,840
And with such important matter,
you went to An instead of me.

293
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,120
By the time I figured out who
Nong Punn was scheming with...

294
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,160
...Leo and Fiat almost broke up.

295
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,800
I'm heartbroken, our good
deeds aren't appreciated.

296
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,200
Right, Nam?

297
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,080
Yeah, I really put my mind to it,
but your twin chews me out.

298
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,160
He doesn't appreciate me at all.

299
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,080
Should I jump off
a building to kill myself?

300
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,360
Good idea, one less waste of space.

301
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,880
It's okay, man.

302
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,760
What do you think?

303
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,680
I'm sure we're gonna
enjoy this match.

304
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,800
You look a little upset today.

305
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,360
What are you doing here?

306
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,240
To say hello to our rival.

307
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,040
I think you look familiar.

308
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,800
He looks like the guy in
the clip with your junior.

309
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,960
Oh, do you know a girl named Punn?
The one with the scandalous clip.

310
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,480
Yeah.

311
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,840
So what?

312
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,040
It's none of your business
what I did with her.

313
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,760
You're right.

314
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,880
But did I tell you?

315
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,320
My friend got a clip where you
tampered with the water bottle.

316
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,640
I think we should tell the referees.

317
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,600
Let's wait after we win
the championship.

318
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,760
Because we're going to
play fair and square today.

319
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,080
Yeah, fair and square. Right?

320
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,240
We should go get ready.

321
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,760
Let's go.

322
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,480
Motherfuckers!

323
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,000
Are you okay?

324
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm okay.

325
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm ready to crush them.

326
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,560
I'm really fine.

327
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,600
We're going to win.

328
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,560
And if we win...

329
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,640
...I've got a reward for you.

330
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,640
Then...

331
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,240
I must win.

332
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,360
I'm going to win today.

333
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,560
Dream on.

334
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,760
Time's almost up!

335
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,680
Ah, I'm going crazy!
The tension's killing me!

336
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,320
Damn, we're gonna win
if he can make this shot.

337
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,360
They can't square our score.

338
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,520
You must make the shot, Leo.

339
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,000
The best way to get revenge on you...

340
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,440
...isn't using dirty tricks like you do.

341
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,080
It's winning the game fair and square.

342
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,360
You'll never defeat us.

343
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,160
Hey, look!

344
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,720
They're kissing!

345
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,480
Now everyone knows that
I'm yours and you're mine.

346
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,760
Like my reward?

347
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,880
Absolutely.

348
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,600
I love you.

349
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,320
I love you too.

350
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,400
Where are you checking in, P' Pob?

351
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,720
Up ahead.

352
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,080
Send me here is enough.

353
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:07,160
Take good care of yourself
when you're there.

354
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,080
Don't work until
you lose track of time.

355
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,440
Okay.

356
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,600
When you put your mind to something,
you tend to forget about yourself.

357
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,240
You can't do that anymore.

358
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,560
Because I can't take care of you anymore.

359
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,600
P' Pob.

360
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,800
Can we not break up?

361
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,320
We can't.

362
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,840
I can't hold you back.

363
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,360
I don't know when I'll be back.

364
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,120
I can't be selfish.

365
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,880
I stand by my word.

366
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,680
You really are a tricky person.

367
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,880
When I express my worries,
you only mumble in response.

368
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,080
But when it's about our breakup,
you give a clear-cut answer.

369
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,040
I'm sorry.

370
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,440
It's okay.

371
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,600
I understand.

372
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,920
Am I your Mr. Right?

373
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Yes.

374
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,040
You're my Mr. Right.

375
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,320
But it's not the right
time for us, right?

376
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,080
It's just that our time doesn't match.

377
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,880
I love you.

378
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,000
I love you too.

379
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,160
Take care.

380
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,600
Pob...

381
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,000
No.

382
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,640
I have to go now.

383
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,920
What's this?

384
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,120
Oh, Kitty Boy.

385
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,080
Pob, my name is Pob.

386
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,520
I'm pursuing you.

387
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,600
And I'm...

388
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,520
...gonna be your boyfriend.

389
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,520
This is what you call
stealing a kiss.

390
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,920
Next time, just tell him we're dating.

391
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,200
Sometimes, love plays tricks on us.

392
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,760
The one we love stands before us,
yet they are too far to reach.

393
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,000
Sometimes, we need to let go
because it's not the right time.

394
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,320
Sometimes, we are forced to choose...

395
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,640
But when the right time
and right one come.

396
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,240
Will you be my boyfriend?

397
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,760
Okay.

398
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,760
I'll be your boyfriend.

399
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:46,440
Love will tell us that we don't
need to run away anymore.

400
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,600
I'm proud of you today.

401
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,720
If it feels right, don't deny
the love in your heart.

402
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,320
Who are you looking for?

403
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,160
The guys who roll the ball.

404
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,880
And the guys who carry
the lights and stall the janitor.

405
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,480
Oh, and the guy who
films the clip too.

406
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,240
They're not here.

407
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,640
There's only me today.

408
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,400
Says who? There's me too.

409
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,400
Yes, there are you and me.

410
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,240
There's us.

411
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,480
Let me say it first.

412
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:10,840
I wanna apologize for all those times.

413
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,000
I made mistakes.

414
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,200
I screwed up.

415
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,720
I hurt you.

416
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,840
I did spiteful things which hurt everyone.

417
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,560
Now that when we're dating,
I still screwed up.

418
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:57,000
I don't know if there'll be a day when
I become a perfect boyfriend for you.

419
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,040
But I'll be me...

420
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,600
...who loves you with all my heart.

421
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,840
My turn.

422
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,080
In my whole life.

423
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,640
There's a boy who's
always been by my side.

424
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,080
I promised to take care of him.

425
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,520
To protect him.

426
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,160
To stay by his side.

427
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,920
But I...

428
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,160
...made him cry over and over again.

429
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,680
I'm sorry.

430
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:09,760
For being a coward.

431
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:24,600
I don't know what I
should do in a relationship.

432
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,319
I'll probably never be
a perfect boyfriend.

433
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,040
But there's one thing
I'm better than anyone.

434
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,240
It's loving you with all my heart.

Whether in the past,
the present, or the future.

I'll be by your side forever.

437
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,320
I'll also be by your side forever.

438
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,560
Yeah.

439
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,160
I won't let you reject me again.

440
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,840

What? Is it wrong

No.
