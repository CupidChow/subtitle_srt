1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,560
So you're saying...

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,800
...this is a housewarming gift
from Tho and Nam?

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,080
Yeah.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
You didn't buy it for yourself?

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,080
No, you know how sick Nam is.
He loves teasing people.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,680
I guess this is also part of his plan
to tease you and me.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,240
So...

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,840
You like this kind of stuff?

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
No, I don't.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,280
How could I like it?
I've never used one before.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,560
Fine.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,080
It's true I've slept with many men.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,600
But I'm not into kinky sex, like trying
every position or using this stuff.

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,320
Okay, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,240
But you've...

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,760
...never really used it?

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,160
Leo.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,960
If I use it with you...

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,240
...I'll be the first one then.

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,479
Leo.

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
Though you're not my first man.

22
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,840
I'll let you do anything to me.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,240
Only you.

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,400
What's wrong with P' Leo, P' Fiat?

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
Why are you here?

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,079
What? I can't be here without a reason?

27
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,079
Leon, I'm not in the mood for a joke now.

28
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,640
I didn't wanna interrupt
your late night activity too.

29
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
But I couldn't reach you on the phone.

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
Take a look.

31
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
What is this?

32
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,040
What? Let me see.

33
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
Let me see.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,440
There was a letter addressed
to our surname, so I opened it.

35
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,720
Shit, what is this?

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,760
They must've sent this to our parents.

37
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,920
P' Fiat, do you have any idea
who might hate you this much?

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know.

39
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,520
They deliberately sent this
to your parents.

40
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,120
They know I care about them a lot.

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,040
Leo! What am I gonna do
if your parents see this!

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,280
What am I gonna do, Leo!

43
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
It's okay.

44
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,400
- It's not okay! You've seen it!
- It's okay, let's calm down first.

45
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,920
Calm down.

46
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,520
It's okay, calm down.

47
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,960
Hello, Uncle.

48
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,960
Yes, I'm with P' Fiat.

49
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,080
Yes.

50
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,320
Sure, I'll tell him.

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Your dad wants you to go home now.

52
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,840
Leo, what should I do?

53
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
What am I supposed to do now?

54
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,720
I don't know what to do anymore!
Leo, please help me!

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Leo!

56
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,800
You okay?

57
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,880
I don't know if those damn
photos were sent to my dad too.

58
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,280
He probably wants to curse me out.

59
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,120
But, whatever.

60
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm used to it.

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
I'm a horrible son in his eyes anyway.

62
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,720
I've got nothing more to lose.

63
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
You know the only people
I care about are...

64
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,400
...your dad, your mom, and you.

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,320
Promise me that you'll be calm.

66
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Okay.

67
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,760
I'll try.

68
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,760
That's more than enough.

69
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,880
EP.3: Trembling hearts

70
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,960
EP.3: Trembling hearts
Explain what this is about.

71
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,560
Explain what this is about.

72
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,200
Don't you see what it is?

73
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,400
Answer me while
I'm still being nice to you.

74
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,320
Fiat.

75
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,440
I've turned a blind eye to what
you've been doing outside all this time.

76
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
But can you consider my feelings?

77
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,000
[Your son's a slut who sleeps around
and steals boyfriends!]

78
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,480
[Your son's a slut who sleeps around
and steals boyfriends!]
How would I feel to see
my only son sleep around?

79
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,680
How would I feel to see
my only son sleep around?

80
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,400
What do you care?

81
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,440
Why don't you devote your time
on your wife and daughter?

82
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,440
My wife is your mother.

83
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,040
My daughter is your sister!

84
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
I only have one mother.

85
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,600
The one who was abandoned by you!

86
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,560
Please calm down, Uncle Mait.

87
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
If you keep this up...

88
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,680
...one day Leo won't tolerate you anymore.

89
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,440
How would his family think...

90
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,720
...seeing you acting like
a scum next to their son?

91
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,240
Sleeping around!

92
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
Sleeping with men!

93
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,240
Stealing people's boyfriends!

94
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,320
What parents in their right minds...

95
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,120
...would let their son stay next
to someone like you?

96
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
It's not like that, Uncle.

97
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,520
Go repent in your room.

98
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,240
And don't you dare leave this house!

99
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,840
You know what I'm capable of!

100
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
Yes, I know.

101
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,800
I know it very welll.

102
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,120
I have something to tell you.

103
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,040
How did you get her hair tangled?

104
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
Fiat.

105
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,560
Will you stay over the night?

106
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
Why are you back?

107
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
Fa.

108
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,560
That's not very nice at all.
Speak nicely to your brother.

109
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,800
And why would I do that?
P' Fiat hates Mama, so I hate him!

110
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,040
Nong Fa!

111
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,400
Mama never taught you to speak like that.

112
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,200
Don't let me hear you
speak like that again.

113
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,400
Okay.

114
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,720
Can you consider my feelings?

115
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,720
How would I feel to see
my only son sleep around?

116
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,600
If you keep this up...

117
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,600
...one day Leo won't tolerate you anymore.

118
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,720
What parents in their right minds
would let their son stay next to you?

119
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
Leave your boyfriend or I'll release
this for the whole campus to see.

120
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,320
You won't be able to show
your face in public agian.

121
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
Fuck you! Son of a bitch!

122
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,080
What do you want from me!

123
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
What do you want from me!

124
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,520
Go on! Do it! Just fucking do it!

125
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,880
Don't watch it.

126
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,320
What parents in their right minds
would let their son stay next to you?

127
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,200
Don't watch it.

128
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,600
Go wash up, we're gonna be late.

129
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,560
An apology gift for
missing our date last night.

130
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
Just a coffee?

131
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,200
Then...

132
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,440
I'll compensate with something else.

133
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,600
So what happened with P' Leo last night?

134
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,480
The ice's melting.

135
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,760
I'll walk you to the faculty building.

136
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,400
Do you have anything to ask me?

137
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And do you have anything to tell me?

138
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
Well...

139
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,640
I didn't wanna hide it from you.

140
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,280
But hear me out first.

141
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,440
About that clip.

142
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,360
I don't remember...

143
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,920
...when it happened.

144
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
Or when it was filmed.

145
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,440
But someone suddenly sent it to
me and demanded me to leave you.

146
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,520
If I don't leave you, they'll release
it for the whole campus to see.

147
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,680
What? Who are they?

148
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,440
I don't know, but I don't care.

149
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,800
But they said...

150
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:55,800
You know that I don't care
what other students say about me.

151
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,400
I don't care if the whole
campus watches my sex tape.

152
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,240
Because it's in the past.

153
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,760
But the only one I care about...

154
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
...is you.

155
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,880
How do you feel...

156
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,560
...seeing me sleep with someone else?

157
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,680
You're disgusted with me, right?

158
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,320
No, I'm not disgusted with you.

159
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,600
Then can you stand it?

160
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,080
When the whole campus knows
how slutty your boyfriend is.

161
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,720
You don't have to answer me.
I don't know who the culprit is anyway.

162
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,640
I think we'd better stay away
from each other for the time being.

163
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
No, Fiat.

164
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,320
- I don't care.
- You do.

165
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,000
What parents in their right minds
would let their son stay next to you?

166
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm sorry.

167
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,480
Sorry for being a fuck-up.

168
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,440
And I'm sorry.

169
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,440
For being with a good guy like you.

170
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,640
I'll go home by myself today.

171
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,320
Since my dad won't let me go anyway.

172
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,080
In today's lesson, we're going
to learn about making animation.

173
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,840
Well? Do you like our gift, Nong Fiat?

174
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
Fiat.

175
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,760
Fiat.

176
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,320
Guys, don't talk to me now.

177
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Alright, we'll talk about
diplomacy tradition next time.

178
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,440
And please finish the assignment
I've given you. Class dismissed.

179
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,600
Leo, class is over.

180
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,640
Are you okay?

181
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,200
Yeah.

182
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,320
Like hell I'll believe that.

183
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,240
I'm just mad at myself.

184
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,080
- Must be about Fiat again.
- No.

185
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,880
Yeah, you can say that.

186
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,040
For God's sake.

187
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
But it's my fault.

188
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,760
If I had the courage to confess earlier...

189
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
...he wouldn't have gone through
something like this.

190
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,200
But just forget it.

191
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,200
Do you need our help?

192
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,040
No.

193
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,840
Aek, can you help me?

194
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,400
You guys talk.
I don't need to know about this.

195
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Thanks, Anda.
I want less people to know about it.

196
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,920
Where's Fiat?

197
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,840
He's left.

198
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,320
Oh, he didn't tell you?

199
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,400
No.

200
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,920
I'm going home first.

201
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,720
Why are you avoiding me?

202
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,960
I need time to think.

203
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,680
Please answer my call.

204
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,520
I don't wanna talk right now.

205
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,880
Ok, ok.

206
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,440
But call me when you're ready to talk.

207
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,680
How's it going?

208
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,320
I'm getting close.
Gimme a few more days.

209
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,320
Thanks.

210
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,880
Aren't you gonna ask
why I slapped you?

211
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,080
Why did you slap me, Nina?

212
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,440
Who were you with last night?

213
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,440
Don't think I don't know
you cheated on me!

214
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Don't you have anything to say?

215
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,520
- Tell me it isn't true!
- Nina.

216
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,240
Didn't you say it yourself that
it was only sex between us?

217
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,560
Oh, Leon?

218
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,640
What a coincidence.
What are you doing here?

219
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm waiting for a friend to bring me
some stuff. What about you?

220
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,040
I was supposed to do a report
with my friend, but she stood me up.

221
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,560
I don't wanna go back to my dorm,
so I'm looking for a place to hang out.

222
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,240
Why don't we do
something fun to kill time?

223
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,640
Only if we keep it casual.
I don't wanna get serious.

224
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,480
Sure, I'm fine with it.

225
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,040
Is that all you wanna say?
I'm leaving.

226
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,600
Bastard.

227
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,760
Scum.

228
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,920
It fucking hurts.

229
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,120
Dammit.

230
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,480
Got three slaps this time.

231
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,080
That sucks.

232
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,760
You're full already, hmm?

233
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,080
Come on, let's go.

234
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,760
Wow.

235
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,040
Getting three slaps doesn't hurt
as much as being ignored once.

236
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,480
Whatever.

237
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,720
It sucks.

238
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,040
Fucking sucks.

239
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,440
Who the hell agreed
to keep it casual?

240
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,360
Was that her hand or her foot?

241
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,360
What?

242
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,880
For me?

243
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,080
Umm, can you hear me?

244
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,200
Let's go.

245
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,760
Wait a minute, Mister.

246
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,160
Don't be a player when you grow up.

247
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,880
Do you see now?
The results of committing sins.

248
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,200
Your cute cheeks are so pitiful.

249
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,960
Hold on, Mister.
Which faculty are you in?

250
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,200
Mister?

251
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,760
I'm asking you a question.

252
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,320
Your question, I don't have to answer it.

253
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,880
Don't listen to him.
You'll pick up bad habits.

254
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
Let's go.

255
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,760
I was insulted?

256
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,560
Yeah, I was insulted.

257
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,400
But...

258
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,920
Thank you though, I needed this.

259
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,600
Whatever.

260
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,280
Let's go annoy P' Leo.

261
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,400
They're fucking swollen.

262
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,440
P' Leo, where's P' Fiat?

263
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,920
Where's he?

264
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,840
At his home.

265
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,920
Then let me sleep here tonight.

266
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,159
I'm too lazy to go home.

267
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,679
Being in love is a real headache.

268
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,520
Let's stop partying for a while.

269
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm worried.

270
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,520
What do you think
is going on between them?

271
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,960
How would I know?

272
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,440
But it's no fun teasing Fiat
when he's become like this.

273
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,080
And my bro won't even tell me
what's going on between them.

274
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,320
- Natsu.
- Hmm?

275
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,960
- Go ask him.
- Huh, why me?

276
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,080
If it's you, Fiat will surely give in.

277
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,720
Yeah, he'll tell us off if we ask.

278
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah, or brush us off
and give us the cold shoulder.

279
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
It's gotta be you.

280
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,920
- Yeah, you do it.
- Yeah, you.

281
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Hmm?

282
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,840
Fiat.

283
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,800
My dear Fiat.

284
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,640
They sent you?

285
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,520
Shall we talk?

286
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,240
Sure.

287
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,120
Do you think I'm a slut?

288
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,440
Hey, who said that to you?

289
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,400
It's the truth though.

290
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,160
I don't know what's happened
that makes you think that.

291
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,760
I know you've slept with many people.

292
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,280
But!

293
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,800
You've never harmed anyone.

294
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,040
As long as you don't
get involved with taken men...

295
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,760
...what you do is your personal matter.

296
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,720
It's your right.

297
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,560
And no one has the right to criticize you.

298
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,800
Besides, you'd never
called anyone your boyfriend.

299
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,880
But every since you had Leo,
you've stopped clubbing and everything.

300
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,640
Isn't that right? Hmm?

301
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,000
Well...

302
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,640
I wanted to steal
someone's boyfriend once.

303
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,400
Huh?

304
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,160
Yeah.

305
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,880
But I failed.

306
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,360
I did it because he said
the same thing as Leo.

307
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,400
He said, if I don't love myself,
nobody else will love me.

308
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,800
So I had this stupid thought.

309
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,560
That at least there was someone
who could replace Leo.

310
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,760
I've always wondered, Fiat.

311
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,000
Leo and you had feelings for
each other since our first year.

312
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,240
No, you seemed to
like each other before that.

313
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,400
But why have you just
started dating recently?

314
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,920
Well...

315
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,720
It's my fault.

316
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
I was a coward.

317
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,600
I used to...

318
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,960
...beg my mom to stay with me.

319
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,080
But she still left me.

320
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,240
I tried begging my dad
to spare me some love.

321
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
But he still left me
to be with his new wife.

322
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,040
When I showed someone I loved them...

323
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,080
...I always got dumped.

324
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:30,280
So I was scared that Leo would
leave me like everyone else.

325
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,360
You get what I mean, right?

326
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
I realized I had feelings for Leo
when we were in high school.

327
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,720
But I didn't dare confess.

328
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,800
Because if I lost him,
I'd have nothing left in my life.

329
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,440
So I had this childish thought.
If I was with someone else...

330
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,840
...would he feel possessive of me?

331
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,440
Would he stop me?

332
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,520
Would he say I belonged to him?

333
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,840
That's your friend.

334
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,320
Yeah, he's my friend.

335
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,760
But I forgot that he'd been
indulging me since we were young.

336
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,440
He'd never stopped me
from whatever I did.

337
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,120
Wanna go say hi?

338
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
No, let's go.

339
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,040
So I assumed that he didn't love me.

340
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,200
And did more things to spite him.

341
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,160
Stupid, right?

342
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,000
I was a total moron.

343
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,760
Do you know?

344
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,160
I'd done things to
spite Leo for four years.

345
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,160
I don't even know
how many men I slept with.

346
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,800
Ever since I dated him.

347
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,360
Being his boyfriend.

348
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:38,080
I've realized that I made
a lot of mistakes in the past.

349
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,720
I've been the only one for Leo.

350
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,920
But I...

351
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,080
I chose the stupid method instead.

352
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,840
I'm being punished...

353
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
...for what I did.

354
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,000
Who would do this to you?

355
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,480
They wanna release
the clip to the faculty?

356
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,320
It's just a sex tape.
People will forget soon.

357
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,360
But you know how many
loose-tongued people are out there!

358
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,560
I can imagine what will happen next.

359
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,880
It's okay.

360
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,880
You've got me, An, your teammates.

361
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,400
And you've still got Leo too.

362
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
If he doesn't hate me first.

363
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,240
He won't. Right, Leo?

364
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,720
I'm leaving.

365
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,640
I'll never hate you.

366
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,160
I don't wanna talk to you now.

367
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,520
You can just listen.

368
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,200
I'll never hate you.

369
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,560
Yes, you're right.

370
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,560
I couldn't stand watching that damn clip.

371
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,120
But it's because I'm jealous.

372
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,280
I don't want anyone to touch you.

373
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,080
Who could bear seeing his
boyfriend be with someone else?

374
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,880
I'm not afraid of gossips.

375
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,240
All I'm worried about is your feelings.

376
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,280
My dad's right.

377
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,640
Who would wanna be with a scum like me?

378
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,840
What parents in their right minds
would let their son be with me?

379
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,040
I told your dad that we're together.

380
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,840
I told him I don't care about your past.

381
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,120
All I care is right now,
at this moment...

382
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,000
...you're mine.

383
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,120

How am I supposed to walk to my car?

404
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,640
Oh, Kitty Boy.

405
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,640
You've got an umbrella.
Please let me tag along.

406
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,240
Hold on, Senior.

407
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,480
This is an umbrella for one.

408
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,800
Hey, you're gonna leave me like this?

409
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,920
What a heartless beauty.

410
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,480
He's so kind to the cat.

411
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,160
But why is he so mean to me?

412
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,800
Forget it, it's a hassle.

413
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,120
Let's wait for ten minutes.

414
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,960
I'll just run if it doesn't let up.

415
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,680
Here.

416
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,320
I'm leaving.

417
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,280
Wait, Senior.

418
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,360
You bought me an umbrella?

419
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,320
Don't get wet.

420
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,760
Wait!

421
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,800
Oh, how much is it? I'll pay you.

422
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,960
It's fine. Have a safe trip home.

423
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,160
What's wrong with me?

424
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,520
I'm all soaked.

425
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,800
Pobjer.

426
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,920
Come eat your snack.

427
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,360
Jer.

428
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,560
I bought it for you, here.

429
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,360
C'mere.

430
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,120
You're being haughty again.
Why are you so haughty? C'mere.

431
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,960
Here, eat your snack.

432
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,800
Come on.

433
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,040
Jeez, I was only gone for a while.

434
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,880
Are you sulking? Are you?
Hmm? You're sulking?

435
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,720
Hmm?

436
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,320
I already bought you a snack.

437
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,640
See?

438
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,280
Those brothers are
the exact opposite of each other.

439
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,280
Okay, go play.

440
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,240
Come sit here.

441
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,000
Stop crying.

442
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,640
I'm not crying.

443
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,560
Then why are your eyes so red?

444
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,720
Come on, I've stopped crying.

445
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,160
If you say so.

446
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,560
Come on, let's sleep.

447
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,640
Okay.

448
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,600
Do you think they'll send
the clip to your parents?

449
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,800
No, they probably don't know
that my parents are abroad.

450
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,320
I'm scared they'll be disappointed.

451
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,960
I know.

452
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,080
Leo, when I ran away from home back then.

453
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,320
If your parents didn't help me,
I don't know where I would've ended up.

454
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,240
I still remember what your mom said.

455
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:14,760
She said I could stay at
your home whenever I wanted.

456
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,520
And she said she loved me like a son.

457
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,920
I just don't want her
to be disappointed in me.

458
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,680
She loves you very much.

459
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,800
She favors you more than Leon and me.

460
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,560
Did you know?

461
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,080
The only people I care about
are you and your parents.

462
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,600
Leon must be feeling hurt.

463
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,080
Fine, including him too.

464
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,080
It's better to leave him out.

465
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,000
Though he's my brother,
I'm still jealous.

466
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,480
Is that so?

467
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,520
You should sleep now.

468
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,240
You look like you've been
sleep-deprived for days.

469
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,560
Stop thinking.

470
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,120
I'll deal with everything else.

471
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,840
Hmm?

472
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,840
Deal with what?

473
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,680
You must sleep now.
If you don't, I'll tell my mom.

474
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,760
Fine, I'll sleep now.

475
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,720
Who the hell are you?

476
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,720
Let me go! I said let go!
Who the hell are you!

477
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,840
What do you want? Let me go!

478
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,720
Who the hell are you? Let
me go! Let me the fuck go!

479
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,800
- Hey. He's so loud, bro.
- Let me go!

480
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,960
Shut him up.

481
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,880
Bro, can I kick his ass?

482
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,080
If something happens, deal with
Papa yourself. I won't help you.

483
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,800
Took me a lot of effort to find you.

484
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,280
Bro, can I puch him one more time?

485
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,120
That's enough, I'm borrowing
Papa's men to help Leo find him...

486
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,280
...not to send you to jail
for physical assault.

487
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,320
Bro, how could you say that after
those two have beaten him to a pulp?

488
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,240
Fine, whose big bro are you? So stern.

489
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,600
Whose little bro are you? So silly.
