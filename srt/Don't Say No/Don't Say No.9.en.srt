1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,240
I remember now.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,600
You told me to hate everyone.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,040
I want to hear the truth, Uncle Mait.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,240
What truth?

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,080
The reason you won't let Fiat see his mom.

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,720
Are you going to reproach
me in place of my son?

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
I'm not Fiat, Uncle.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,080
No matter how much you
try to change the subject...

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,360
...I won't be tricked and
argue with you like him.

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,120
Yes.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,920
I forbid Fiat's mother from seeing him.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,080
And things should end with him
hating me, not them meeting each other.

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,400
Why are you doing this?

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,680
Are you protecting him from something?

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Why do you think that?

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,560
Because I know you've
done everything for him.

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,039
You wouldn't let him go to
the summer camp with me.

18
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,240
Because you were afraid
he'd be gone for good.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,720
You wouldn't let him move out.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,000
Because you were afraid
you wouldn't see him again.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,640
But you won't say it.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,440
You act like you're fine
even if he hates you.

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,880
But I know it's not true.

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,800
Fiat's mother has a problem.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,680
It started when she
was pregnant with him.

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,440
Her symptoms kept getting worse
until she wouldn't let anyone near him.

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,800
When I found out she taught him to think
that no one loved him excpet for her...

28
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,440
...I couldn't take it.

29
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,520
No matter how much I loved her...

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
...I couldn't stand seeing
my son turn into an object.

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
But I guess I realized that
when it was too late.

32
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,480
And I believe she
secretly came to see Fiat...

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,960
...because she saw
your love confession clip.

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,320
She can't stand seeing him
love anyone more than her.

35
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,840
Be careful.

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,920
This woman did many things
to Fiat more than we can imagine.

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Good boy.

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,720
Come to Mommy.

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm here now.

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,840
What did you do to him?
Why's he like this?

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,760
Out of my way.

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,600
You're the one who should leave!

43
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Get out of my and my son's way!

44
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,720
I'll call the police if you don't leave!

45
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,480
Help me, Fiat! Help me!

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,320
Fiat, help me!

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,680
You can't let this boy do this to me, Fiat!

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,640
I'm important to you, right?

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,920
Come to me!
Let me go.

50
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,280
I said get out!

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,920
You can't do this to me!
Fiat.

52
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,480
Let me go!
I want to see my son!

53
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
Let go!

54
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,240
You can never take my
son away from me! Never!

55
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
I love only you.
You must hate everyone.

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,000
I love only you.
All you need is me.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Nobody loves you but me.
I love only you.

58
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,000
All you need is me.
Nobody loves you but me.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,440
Keep it in mind.

60
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,560
EP.9: An important person
who still remains in his heart

61
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,160
You little shit, we left home
together, but why do need two rides?

62
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,920
What a mood killer.
Bro, stop complaining.

63
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,360
Can't I have my own cool scene?

64
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,480
Watch.

65
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
And learn.

66
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,280
You think you look so cool?

67
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
Look who's talking.

68
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,200
Oh, Young Master Leo.
How can we be of service?

69
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
Can you send some men
to guard my front gate?

70
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,120
There's someone
I want to keep away.

71
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,320
From here or from Fiat?

72
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,919
Sorry, I can't help you this time.

73
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,159
This little shit recently pissed off
our family's important client.

74
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,960
Papa's very angry and wants to see...

75
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,800
...if he can break his habit when
there's no one to clean up his mess.

76
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
Hey.

77
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,680
You've still got me.
I'll keep watch for you.

78
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,760
And you've still got me, dude.
I'll keep watch for you.

79
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,000
Thanks so much.

80
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,640
I'll go check on Fiat.

81
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,240
Go.

82
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,000
Where's my thanks?

83
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,520
Hey, what about me?

84
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,800
Bro, look at your friend.
He ignored me again.

85
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,040
Bro, do you know which
animal causes global warming?

86
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,600
What?
My breath stinks?

87
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,800
Bro.

88
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,560
Do you have mouthwash?

89
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,600
Ignoring me again.

90
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,200
Maybe there's one here?

91
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,440
Do you want to talk?

92
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,280
What did your mom do to you?

93
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
Nothing.

94
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
It's nothing.

95
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,480
Things have come to this
point, but you still deny it?

96
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,720
- I told you she didn't do anything!
- Fiat.

97
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
Can't you tell me?

98
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,720
So I can help you.

99
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
I thought you wouldn't
keep secrets from me again.

100
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,400
It's all in the past!
Why won't you understand?

101
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,400
It's useless to tell you.
You can't help me!

102
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,600
You're right.

103
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm useless.

104
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
Here you are.

105
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,520
Aek told me everything.

106
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,440
So you're here to slap me?

107
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,040
And did you do anything
to deserve a slap?

108
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,240
I don't know what's going
on between you guys.

109
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,960
Aek's got no clue too.

110
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,920
But you should know best, Leo.

111
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,960
I know Fiat's scared.

112
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,040
I knew from the start he wasn't okay.

113
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,800
Every time he says it's
nothing or that he's fine...

114
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,560
...it's never the case at all.

115
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,120
Despite knowing he wasn't okay...

116
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,680
...I still got angry with him for
not saying what was on his mind.

117
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,880
In the end, I guess I'm
angry with myself the most.

118
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,160
Two people in a relationship
can't always see eye to eye.

119
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,400
The most important thing
is adapting to each other.

120
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,200
It's better this way.

121
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,240
Because it means you're
trying to understand each other.

122
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,120
When you stop thinking
or paying attention...

123
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,600
...it means you don't
love each other anymore.

124
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,560
Personal experience?

125
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,520
Let's just say that even if
Fiat doesn't say anything...

126
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,840
...his eyes have long shown
that he couldn't live without you.

127
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,000
And this is Fiat, not Nat.

128
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,880
So I can't answer for him.

129
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,200
Oh, don't forget to talk to
him after you stop being angry.

130
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm leaving.

131
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,720
Oh, Fiat!

132
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,480
You're up?

133
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,040
What's wrong?

134
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,040
You look like you've seen
Nam filming your sexcapades.

135
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
Are you okay?

136
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,400
How long have you been here?

137
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
Since morning.

138
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,040
Leo asked me to watch over you.

139
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,360
Though he actually
asked my bro to do it.

140
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,840
But I'm free today,
so I came instead of him.

141
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,600
Leo left in the morning.

142
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,560
Really?

143
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,520
Umm...

144
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
So...

145
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,960
Did anyone come while I was sleeping?

146
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,400
Who do you mean?

147
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,800
- Forget it.
- Huh?

148
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,320
It's nothing.

149
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,400
Make yourself at home.

150
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,640
I'll go get some water
and go back to sleep.

151
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,359
Okay, fine.

152
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,800
The hell?

153
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,480
Hmm?

154
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,359
What's up, my dear friend?

155
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,119
Where the hell are you?

156
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,359
I know Fiat's playing hooky
because Leo told me.

157
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,000
But you can't let me do the work alone.

158
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,280
If you don't show
up in half an hour...

159
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,800
...I'll post the clip of you
scratching your butt.

160
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,160
- Fuck you. But Leo said...
- I don't care.

161
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm not gonna do
a group project alone.

162
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,560
Now that I'm angry, you should
get your ass here right now!

163
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,840
Fine, fine, fine. I'll be there.

164
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,840
What the fuck?

165
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,040
Fiat, I'm going to see Nam.
He's gonna bite my head off.

166
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,640
Oh, let's come up with
a few food jokes to tell him.

167
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,400
Fiat.

168
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,120
I love only you.

169
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,800
All you need is me.

170
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,560
You're unwanted, just like me.

171
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,680
Nobody loves you but me.

172
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,000
Listen to only me!

173
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,120
Why can't you remember
what I teach you!

174
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,920
Listen!

175
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,880
Listen to me! Listen!
Listen to me! Listen!

176
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,080
Leo!

177
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,600
You've gotta be strong.

178
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,520
You can't be weak.

179
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,120
Be strong.

180
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
You can do it.

181
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,840
I went upstairs and saw you sleeping.
I didn't want to wake you up.

182
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,920
I was cleaning up
the house for you.

183
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,400
Are you hungry?

184
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,600
We're finally alone.

185
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,040
I missed you so much.

186
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,880
I won't hate anyone, Mom.

187
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm gonna apologize
to Dad and Auntie Fay.

188
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,640
I won't hurt anyone, Mom.

189
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,520
You're disobeying me?

190
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,280
Why have you become like this?

191
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
Don't you love me anymore!

192
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,360
I love you, Mom.

193
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,000
But there are other
people that I love too.

194
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,800
No, you can't love other people!

195
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,640
Because of that Leo boy, right?

196
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,040
You've become rebellious
because of him, right?

197
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,200
No, Mom. Leo helps me
become a better person.

198
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,720
You don't have to
be good to anyone.

199
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,560
Just be good to me is enough!

200
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,040
Understand?

201
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,640
- Leo, help me.
- Understand? Answer me!

202
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,760
- Where are you? I don't wanna be here.
- Why are you like this? Answer me!

203
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,320
- Answer me! Answer!
- Leo, I'm scared.

204
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,280
I said answer me! Answer!

205
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,680
- Understand? Answer me!
- Boys, what are you doing?

206
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,200
Do you hear me?
Answer me! Answer!

207
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,200
Stop! What's going on?

208
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,840
Dad!

209
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,080
Who are you?
Why did you hurt my son?

210
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
How's Fiat?

211
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,080
He's fine now.

212
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,720
Thank you for helping my son, Korn.

213
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,440
Don't mention it,
Fiat's like a son to me.

214
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,240
But I must admit
I was pretty shocked.

215
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,200
I was planning to surprise the boys, but
met with the more surprising scene instead.

216
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,520
I don't know how she escaped.

217
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,760
I emphasized to her that
if she approached him again...

218
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,720
...I'd take legal action.

219
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,160
But it turns out I put him in danger.

220
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,120
Thank you again.

221
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,960
You owe me two times now.

222
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,080
How about you give
your son to my son?

223
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,840
Then we'll be even.

224
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,280
I have no right to object.

225
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,280
Since your son's always
been taking care of my son.

226
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,160
But he'd be a lot cooler
if he wasn't absent today.

227
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,880
He'll come soon.

228
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
Where's Fiat?

229
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,920
In the bedroom.

230
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,960
Look.

231
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,320
You should give Fiat to my son.

232
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,200
Look at him. Hasn't seen his father
in years, but he didn't even say hi.

233
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,920
Looks like your son
is all he thinks about.

234
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,360
I'm glad.

235
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,480
At least Leo stays by Fiat's side.

236
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,480
More than me, his father...

237
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,520
...who couldn't even tell him the truth.

238
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,800
Can I hold you?

239
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,720
You shouldn't come near me.

240
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,760
I might hurt you like my mom did to me.

241
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,520
I don't know.

242
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,600
I don't know if I'll do to you
the same things I did to my dad.

243
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,240
To Auntie Fay.

244
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,040
I might hurt anyone.

245
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,280
No, Fiat.

246
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,480
You're not that kind of person.

247
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,880
But my mom taught
me to be like that.

248
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,960
She taught me!

249
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm more scared of you hurting
yourself than you hurting others.

250
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,880
But...

251
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
But...

252
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,080
But I did as my mom taught me.

253
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,000
Everything!

254
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,640
I hurt every woman around my dad.

255
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,960
I pushed Auntie Fay down!

256
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,800
I made Fa hate me.

257
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,360
I hated my dad!

258
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,320
I did everything my mom told me to.

259
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,720
I don't know if I'll do to you
the same things my mom did.

260
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,480
You...

261
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,960
You shouldn't come near me.

262
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,400
Don't come near me, Leo!

263
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,200
- No, Fiat.
- Leo!

264
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,240
Fiat.

265
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,280
Even if you chase me away,
I won't go anywhere.

266
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,440
But if...

267
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,560
...I did what my mom told me to.

268
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,440
You might chase me away.

269
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,920
Like my dad did to my mom.

270
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,120
I don't know anymore, Leo.

271
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,600
You and your mom aren't the same.

272
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
Not at all.

273
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
You are you.

274
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,480
The person I love the most.

275
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,400
Your mom isn't the only
person who loves you.

276
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,440
You have many important
people around you.

277
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,880
I'll proof it to you.

278
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,800
Korn's left.

279
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,680
I think it's time you
told Fiat everything.

280
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,600
Fiat's mother.

281
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,800
Or my ex-wife.

282
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,880
Received a restraining order
to keep away from me and Fiat.

283
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,480
But it was after she had
tormented him for so many years.

284
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,040
After I found out and
we got into a huge fight...

285
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,920
...Fiat was there too.

286
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,280
He suffered from a high fever after that.

287
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,440
Fiat.

288
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
You're waking up, Son?

289
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,440
Where's Mommy?

290
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,800
Mommy's gone.
It's okay, stay with Daddy.

291
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,000
No, I want Mommy!
Where's Mommy?

292
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,440
Fiat, stay with Daddy, okay?

293
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,360
- Fiat.
- No, I want Mommy.

294
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,000
She's gone. Mommy's gone.
Stay with Daddy, okay?

295
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,920
- No, I want Mommy!
- Fiat.

296
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,400
Fiat, Fia...

297
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,920
Don't do this, baby.
Stay with me, okay?

298
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,159
No, I want Mommy!

299
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,639
But when he woke up...

300
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,120
...he forgot everything
his mother had done.

301
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,400
All he knew was that
his mother loved him.

302
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,480
And that I was the one
who took her away from him.

303
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,800
I was willing to be hated...

304
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,560
...than letting him know what
the person he loved the most did to him.

305
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,400
I thought he wanted a mother.

306
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,680
That's why I decided to remarry.

307
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,840
But things got worse.

308
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,840
He refused everyone.

309
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,360
That's when I realized
that though he'd forgotten...

310
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,560
...the things his mother did
still deeply rooted in his head.

311
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
But luckily.

312
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,400
When I sent him to school.

313
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
He met you, Leo.

314
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,040
Without you...

315
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,960
...I don't know what
would become of my son.

316
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,120
I couldn't be his shoulder to lean on.

317
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,160
I never could.

318
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,080
But Fiat never hates you, Uncle Mait.

319
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,040
He just doesn't know
how to express love.

320
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,080
You and him are the same.

321
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,880
He loves you very much.

322
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,920
And he's been waiting...

323
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,040
...for the day you tell him
that you still love him.

324
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,760
Is that so?

325
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,320
Then it means...

326
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,560
...I've been wronging
him this whole time.

327
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,080
I thought things were fine
the way they were.

328
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,880
I've been wrong.

329
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,760
I understand you.

330
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,400
Before I plucked up
enough courage to confess...

331
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,560
...I'd let him suffer for years.

332
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,560
But I want to tell you
that I love him so much.

333
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,880
And I'll take good care of him.

334
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,880
That's what you've
always been doing, Leo.

335
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,400
I'm bored.

336
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,720
Yeah, Fiat's been
skipping classes all week.

337
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
There's no one we can tease.

338
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,400
It's all your fault, you little shit.

339
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,560
You said you'd watch over him
but didn't lock the door when you left.

340
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,680
- You're lucky Leo didn't kill you.
- Come on, bro.

341
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,760
This is your fault.

342
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,760
It's got nothing to do with me.

343
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,840
I never said, 'Don't lock
the door when you leave'.

344
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,080
So don't blame me.

345
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,840
What are you guys doing?

346
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
Is this the sad people zone?

347
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,760
Ouch.

348
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,440
Too gentle, An.
Next time, slap his head.

349
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,480
Who'd be as lovey-dovey
as your couple?

350
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,160
Of course.
Jealous much?

351
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,920
Right, Fiat's birthday's coming up.
Why don't we give him a surprise?

352
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,040
Let's not.

353
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,480
Why? I'll form a team to
create a magnificent surprise.

354
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,400
Let's leave it to Fiat's boyfriend.

355
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,800
Hmm?

356
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,600
What's Leo's plan?

357
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,520
What did you find out?

358
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,840
Yeah, spill it. We're curious.

359
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,000
Just wait and see.

360
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,120
That's mine.

361
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,080
- Let me have some.
- No.

362
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,680
Stingy.

363
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,800
HBD. Where to party this year?

364
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,720
Happy birthday, buddy.

365
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,280
You're only 4 months older than me, you
damn P' Fiat. I'll catch up with you soon.

366
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,800
Happy birthday. When will you come back
to practice? Everyone's whining.

367
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,880
Happy birtdday, P' Fiatttttt!

368
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,040
Happy birthday, Captain.

369
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,400
HBD, wish you a lot of happiness.
Get well soon, everyone misses you.

370
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,760
I miss you guys too.

371
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,600
I wanna be the old confident me too.

372
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,800
But...

373
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,120
Come on, let's get changed.

374
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,080
What?

375
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,800
Let's go out.

376
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,200
But...

377
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,800
Do you trust me?

378
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,960
Leo, why did you blindfold me?

379
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,520
Trust me.

380
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,040
Okay.

381
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,280
Reminds me of the old days.

382
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,760
Remember the first time
I gave you a piggyback?

383
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,880
We went ice skating,
and I fell down and cried.

384
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,360
And Mom told me to
ride on your back, right?

385
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,480
Yes, we both fell down.

386
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,000
So Mom told me to hurry and grow
up, so that I could take care of you.

387
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,960
But you grew up too fast.

388
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,120
Isn't that good?
It's so that I can protect you.

389
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,000
This time, it's
different from that time.

390
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,960
Mom told me to be strong and not
to cry, so that I could take care of you.

391
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,920
But, I'm sorry.

392
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,480
I'm not strong enough right now.

393
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,880
You ready?

394
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm a little nervous.

395
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,200
Don't be, I told you to trust me.

396
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,040
[We Love You So Much]

397
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,720
Now you can stop
thinking that you're alone.

398
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,200
Your friends love you so much.

399
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,960
Worry a lot about you.

400
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,080
And everyone here...

401
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,520
...wants to wish you a happy birthday.

402
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,320
What about you?

403
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,200
Are you ready to accept this gift?

404
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,040
Don't tell me you rent out
the whole place to set this up for me?

405
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,400
Happy birthday.

406
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,720
I thank the day you were born
so that I could meet you.

407
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,920
Ever since I remembered
what my mom did to me...

408
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,920
...I've been afraid of my birthday.

409
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,680
I've kept thinking...

410
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,520
...that I shouldn't have been born.

411
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,200
Don't say that.

412
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,400
But I've always been scared.

413
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,040
I may not know what
happened 21 years ago.

414
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,440
But I'm thankful for that day.

415
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,640
The day you were born to meet me.

416
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,920
And I was born to meet you.

417
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
I'm thankful that we met each other.

418
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,040
Became friends.

419
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,000
Fell in love.

420
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,200
And became what we are today.

421
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
Can I be your important person?

422
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,640
You are.

423
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,800
You've always been that person.

...is meeting you.

432
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,880
Crying again?

433
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,840
Everyone loves you, worries about you.

434
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,080
Remember, you're not alone.

435
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,160
P' Fiat, where the hell are you?
This isn't you at all.

436
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,560
Come back and bicker with me.

437
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,720
I'm not lonely.

438
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,440
Just don't want my bro to be sad.

439
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,680
Get back to your cheerful self.

440
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,520
I miss the old P' Fiat,
not the you now.

441
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,560
Let me see, who bullied my friend?

442
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,680
That won't do.
Only I can bully you.

443
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,120
Come to me if anyone bullies you.

444
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,960
P' Nam will deal with them.

445
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,400
Let them know who they mess with.

446
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,600
Hey, do you know why people grow old?

447
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,080
Still joking, you little shit?

448
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,360
Fiat, I may be close with Leo,
but I'm your friend too.

449
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,360
Come to me if you're in trouble.
I'll help you right away.

450
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,600
Bro, that's my line.

451
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:21,440
Fiat, you're my best friend.
I really loveeeee you.

452
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,600
Hurry back and do silly things with me.

453
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,600
I don't wanna be called silly alone.

454
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,680
Oh, Leo. Don't get jealous.
I'm your friend, remember?

455
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,680
Your friend, remember?
Your friend.

456
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,120
Hurry back, Fiat.
I miss you.

457
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,760
Fiat, don't think you're all alone.

458
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,440
You still have me, An,
and everyone in the team.

459
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,240
Everyone worries a lot about you.

460
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,000
Come back to class.
Your friends miss you.

461
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,000
An worries about you a lot.

462
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,440
Happy birthday, Fiat.
Wish you a lot of happiness.

463
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,960
Happy birthday to you.

464
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,480
Happy birthday to you.

465
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,640
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

466
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,320
Happy birthday to Fiat.

467
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,320
Happy birthday, Fiat.

468
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,200
I may be close with
Leo, but I'm your friend.

469
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,800
Happy birthday, Fiat!

470
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,240
Leo.

471
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,760
Make a wish.

472
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,920
Do you know why
the candles aren't identical?

473
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,120
This one's from Aek and Tho.

474
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,200
This one's from An and Nat.

475
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,360
This one's from Nam.

476
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,320
This one's from the teammates.

477
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,160
This one's from my parents.

478
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,640
And you might hate this one.

479
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,480
It's from my brother.

480
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,280
This one's from Auntie Fay and Fa.

481
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,440
And this one...

482
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,520
...is from your dad.

483
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,480
They're the people who love you.

484
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,080
They think you're important.

485
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,760
Don't think that you're all alone.

486
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,880
I want you to know
how much everyone loves you.

487
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,960
Everyone still loves me?

488
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,120
Yes.

489
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,320
Everyone.

490
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,600
This one's from you?

491
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,440
Yeah, from me.

492
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,720
I want you to know
how much everyone loves you.

493
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,840
I love you too.

494
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,480
Happy birthday.

495
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Yeah, let's take a selfie.

496
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,520
For this year's birthday,
I wanna thank everyone.

497
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,080
Now I know how much I’m loved
and how many people who care about me…

498
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,640
I promise to become stronger
and a better person for my important people

499
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,280
Especially for this man who
I love more than anyone…Leo…

500
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,440
My big bro's the best.

501
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,520
Seeing P' Fiat smile,
I can finally bully him again.

502
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,240
It's a little depressing
to see him stressed out.

503
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,040
[My Boyfriend]

504
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,840
Hello, my boyfriend.

505
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,080
- Are you free now?
- I'm always free for you.

506
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,600
Can you come to my place?

507
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,680
Okay, I'll be there right away!

508
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,640
Everyone, On's going
to see his boyfriend.

509
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,480
On's boyfriend's so cute
when he's acting cute.

510
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,240
What's Mr. Leon's going on about?

511
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,600
I raised him since he was a baby,
but never heard him speak like that.

512
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,640
Did something happen?

513
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,800
Better inform Sir and Madam.

514
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,840
I'm here, P' Pob.
Why didn't you lock the door?

515
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,280
What's wrong, P' Pob?

516
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,760
The vet called me.

517
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,760
About Jer?
Is she getting worse?

518
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,520
As you know, Leon.

519
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,520
She had many complications.

520
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:36,120
But an hour ago, she fell asleep.

521
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,840
The vet said she... she was gone!

522
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,040
She's gone.

523
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,440
Come here.

524
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,920
Here, your snack.

525
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,840
Come on!

526
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,760
Pobjer is the cutest cat.

527
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,040
Right?

528
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,600
Hmm?

529
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,320
I should've been
with her, but I wasn't.

530
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,920
Jer was gone, but I
wasn't there with her, Leon.

531
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,760
It's okay.

532
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,360
Let's go pick up Jer together.

533
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,400
Leon and Pob will bring her home together.

534
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,200
P' Pob, you can cry.

535
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,880
I want to.

536
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,800
But I couldn't.

537
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,080
You should think that
she's in a better place now.

538
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,960
She's just sleeping here.

539
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,520
You can visit here whenever you want.

540
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,440
She wasn't even a year old.

541
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,080
Hadn't even felt happiness.

542
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,720
Hadn't even done anything.

543
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,600
Who told you she hadn't done anything?

544
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,960
Pobjer brought us together.

545
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,680
If 'Pobphan' is the encounter
between you and your dad...

546
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:56,520
...then can I wish that 'Pobjer' is
the encounter between you and me?

547
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,280
They'll be in our hearts forever.

548
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,000
Whether it's your dad.

549
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,000
Or Pobjer.

550
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,800
It's okay, P' Pob.

551
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,160
Mom.

552
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,319
Fiat.

553
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,479
You've come to see me.

554
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,359
I missed you so much.

555
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,960
Mom.

556
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,800
I love you.

557
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,840
I love you too.

558
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,360
I won't hurt anyone anymore.

559
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,920
Hurting the people
we love isn't love, Mom.

560
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,600
And I won't be like that.

561
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,280
I want to make
the people I love happy.

562
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:18,400
And the one who taught
me that is the guy over there.

563
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,040
Leo.

564
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,800
I'll become a better person.

565
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:44,400
So you're saying you don't
love me anymore, right?

566
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,480
Am I right?

567
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,480
Am I right!

568
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,280
Mom.

569
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,920
Please listen to me.

570
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,440
I love you and will
continue to love you forever.

571
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,200
From now on, you don't
have to sneak out to see me.

572
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,040
I'll visit you often.

573
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,640
But you must come alone.

574
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,600
Okay.

575
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,400
But you need to get plenty of rest.

576
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,720
So that we chat longer next time.

577
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,120
Okay?

578
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,600
It's okay, Mom.

579
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,360
Please don't cry.

580
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,040
I love you.

581
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,880
I'm really all talk.

582
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,560
My hands are still shaking.

583
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,200
I'm still scared of her.

584
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,800
Don't worry, you did good.
Let's take it slow.

585
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,040
I've got to apologize
to Dad and Auntie Fay.

586
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,240
And to Fa too.

587
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,400
I wannna clear everything up.

588
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,480
So that I can become
the same better person.

589
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,280
I believe you can do it.

590
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,000
It's because you've
always been by my side.

591
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,680
I'll be the same better person.

592
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,320
And seduce you more.

593
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:38,640
I'll make you so infatuated with me...

594
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,800
...that you don't dare become
someone else's but mine.

595
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,040
I give in.

596
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,880
Leo's already very infatuated with Fiat.
