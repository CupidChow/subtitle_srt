1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,400
Dad, I remember everything now.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,560
I'm sorry, son.

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,680
Can I...

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,760
Can I hug you?

5
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,560
EP.10: Yes means yes

6
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,400
How was it?

7
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,320
I apologized to my dad.

8
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,800
I told him how I felt.

9
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,400
How I was hurt when he
didn't care about me at all.

10
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,400
And how I was jealous of Auntie
Fay and Fa who received his love.

11
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,040
I also promised him that I'd be a good son.

12
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,000
He even cried too.

13
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,080
This is the first time
I saw his emotional side.

14
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
And he told me that he loves me.

15
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,200
But I couldn't say that I love him.

16
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,040
I was tongue-tied.

17
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,400
It's okay.

18
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,600
Like I said, you can take it slow.

19
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,680
Because from now on, you and
Uncle Mait can spend more time together.

20
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm more scared that you
won't have time for me.

21
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
You know fear too?

22
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,200
Fiat.

23
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
How was the talk with Mait?

24
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Am I disturbing you?

25
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,480
I wanna talk to you and Fa, Auntie Fay.

26
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Nong Fa, P' Fiat has
something to say to you.

27
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,680
But I have nothing to say to him.

28
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,960
I'm sorry.

29
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm sorry that I made your mommy cry
and hurt Daddy's feelings.

30
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,760
And I'm sorry...

31
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,320
...that I've never been
a good brother to you.

32
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,159
Will you give this brother a chance?

33
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,360
Now what do you do? Hmm?

34
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
But P' Fiat hurt Mommy.

35
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,880
P' Fiat already said sorry to Mommy.

36
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,120
And Mommy did P' Fiat wrong too.

37
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,320
You won't forgive Mommy for this?

38
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,160
No, I'm not angry with Mommy.

39
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Then what do you need to do?

40
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,920
You won't bully Mommy anymore, right?

41
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,000
I promise.

42
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,560
Then let's make up, P' Fiat.

43
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,559
My sister's super adorable, isn't she?

44
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
We even made a pinky promise.

45
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,840
Had I known it, I would've
treated her better in the first place.

46
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,160
The important thing is that you're happy.

47
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,640
I'm over the moon right now.

48
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,520
I got to talk to my dad,
Auntie Fay, and my sister.

49
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
And got to see my mom too.

50
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm relieved.

51
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,640
And what about me?

52
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,520
You're sulking? Well?

53
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,640
How could I not?
You always dismissed me.

54
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,320
Come on, I thought it wasn't
something to worry about.

55
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,080
But it was something big
in your boyfriend's eyes.

56
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,200
Leo.

57
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,720
Let me apologize then.

58
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
How can I make it up to you?

59
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,040
Are you seducing me?

60
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Did I succeed?

61
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,080
What are you rushing for?

62
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,720
To punish you.

63
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,040
Hold on a sec.

64
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Hey, I'm gonna fall!

65
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,880
Falling is the last thing
you need to worry about.

66
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
Hey, Leo!

67
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,640
I can't guarantee
that I'll be gentle.

68
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
Who wants you to be gentle?

69
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,560
You're such a tease today.

70
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
'Cause I'm gonna get it today.

71
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,600
Today or tomorrow,
I won't let you leave the bed.

72
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,720
Bring it on.

73
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,600
I can't do it anymore.

74
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,040
I thought you wanted to seduce me.

75
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,880
During these past few days, we only
stayed on bed, used the bathroom , and ate.

76
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,400
This is too much even for me.

77
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,160
But you told me.

78
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,560
To bring it on.

79
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,040
It's true I said that,
but this is too much.

80
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,160
You don't like it?
Are you hurt anywhere?

81
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,320
No.

82
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,840
It's not bad to do this once in a wihle.

83
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,720
So can you go to class tomorrow?
Nam said the professors had asked for you.

84
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,520
I've got to go even if I can't.

85
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,800
I've been missing
classes for two weeks.

86
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,880
I won't graduate if I keep this up.

87
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,800
You don't have to practice tomorrow.

88
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,080
Even if I want to,
I won't be able to do it.

89
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,400
Don't worry, I'm confident
that we'll win the next game.

90
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,960
You can browse MMY
Gift Shop's catalogue at...

91
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,360
Hi, I'd like to buy some dolls.

92
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,080
Which ones would you like?

93
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,120
Hello, I want to buy the ones
in the pictures I sent you.

94
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Yes, all of them.
Don't miss a single one of them.

95
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,960
Oh, and send them to
the address I gave you.

96
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,280
Yes, okay.

97
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,200
P' Pob, are you
writing your thesis?

98
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,560
No, why?

99
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Then I'll take you out for lunch.
My mom misses you.

100
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,480
Do I need to prepare myself?

101
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,720
Don't, just be yourself is enough.

102
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,600
Mom likes it, so do I.

103
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
Hmm?

104
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Are you shy?

105
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,640
Why are you quiet?
Are you shy?

106
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,360
That's nice, I thought I was
the only one who felt shy.

107
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,520
If you wanna do something for me,
just call yourself Pob...

108
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,440
...and I'll fall at your feet.

109
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,720
See you soon.

110
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,080
Okay, hurry up and come pick me up.

111
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,920
I lost.

112
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,680
I've lost since I first
met him until now.

113
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,960
I've lost so much that I almost
become a sucker for Pobphan.

114
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,840
Pob, bring me another plate.

115
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
- This one?
- Yes, put it here.

116
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,200
Looking for Leon?

117
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
No.

118
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,200
Yes.

119
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,680
He's gone shopping for me
and will be back soon.

120
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,240
Hand me the ladle.

121
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,080
Take the spoon.

122
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,760
Since you're here, help
me taste my cooking.

123
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,680
I haven't cooked in ages.
Don't know if I've become rusty at this.

124
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,280
Guess my skills have regressed.

125
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,160
- Here, can you hold it?
- Okay, Auntie.

126
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,840
Delicious.

127
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,760
And next time, don't call
me Auntie. Call me Mom.

128
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,280
Leon's feelings are so obvious.

129
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,400
But I'm not worthy to be with Leon.

130
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,840
How do you measure your worth?

131
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,960
In the end, it's up to the couple
whether they're happy or sad.

132
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,400
Us parents can only be bystanders.

133
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,120
If my father were alive, he would
have gotten along well with you.

134
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
Wow.

135
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,600
Then your father must've
been a really great man.

136
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,960
Right!

137
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,360
There's an annual banquet coming up soon.

138
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,680
Has Leon invited you?

139
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,160
You must come!

140
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,320
You don't need to
worry about your outfit.

141
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
My two sons aren't
interested in fashion at all.

142
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,720
They only wear dull suits,
so Fiat's my only hope.

143
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,800
If you join in too,
it's going to be so much fun.

144
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,640
Oh, I should tell Dad you're
going to attend this year.

145
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
Ah!

146
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,520
I should take this opportunity
to introduce my sons' boyfriends.

147
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,440
Wait for me here.

148
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,680
Is Mom serious about the banquet?

149
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,040
What are you worried about, P' Pob?

150
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,920
It's just a party.

151
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,760
But if you don't wanna go,
I'll tell Mom for you.

152
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,840
She's just excited to dress you up.

153
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,520
But let me tell you, getting
dressed up by her isn't fun at all.

154
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
Then can I not go?

155
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,080
Umm...

156
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,480
If you beg me, I might
help you talk to Mom.

157
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,240
But if you don't wanna do it, then...

158
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,400
Leon.

159
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,200
Can I not go?

160
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,800
Please?

161
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,880
Damn.

162
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,520
Your 'Please?' almost
gave me a heart attack.

163
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,240
Serves you right.

164
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,440
What, Leon?

165
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,320
Huh? Hey! What?

166
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,640
Leon, what are you doing?

167
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,320
What are these?

168
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,720
I know you've been
feeling lonely without Pobjer.

169
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,320
I love it when you call me often.

170
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,080
But I don't like your gloomy voice.

171
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,280
Does this make you feel better?

172
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,000
When you disappeared in the evening...

173
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,600
Oh.

174
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
I went to pick up the dolls
and placed them in your room.

175
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
And asked Mom to buy me time.

176
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Shouldn't have given you my keycard.

177
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,360
You don't like them?

178
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,360
They're going to be covered with dust.

179
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,480
And there're too many.

180
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,080
I'm sorry.

181
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,800
It doesn't mean I don't like them.

182
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,080
Thank you for doing this for me.

183
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,920
If you're unhappy,
Pobjer will be unhappy.

184
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,240
You've got to smile a lot,
so that Pobjer and I will be happy.

185
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,880
What does it have to do with you?

186
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,200
Of course it does.

187
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,360
Because my head's full of you.

188
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,560
Thank you so much.

189
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,560
But just this one's enough.

190
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,480
This doll can represent
both Pobjer and you.

191
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,680
You stole a kiss from me?

192
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,160
This is what you call stealing a kiss.

193
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,240
You're cheating.

194
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,480
You don't like it?

195
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,600
Says who?

196
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Are you seeing what I'm seeing, Tho?

197
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,720
What's gotten into Leo?

198
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,120
The backboard almost breaks
because he wouldn't stop shooting.

199
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,200
I bet he's on dope.

200
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,000
What did you do to him?

201
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,560
- Did it.
- Did it?

202
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,720
Did the deed?

203
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,280
What are you on about?

204
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,880
He said he did it.

205
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,480
What? Making a pledge?

206
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,480
Don't tell me...

207
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,760
We did it.

208
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,320
For three days and three nights.

209
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm gonna go see Leo.

210
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,920
- Horny bastards.
- So annoying.

211
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,160
Hey, do you think there's
gonna be a fourth day?

212
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,680
Bet your ass there'll be.

213
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,480
I bet Fiat made a grand entrance
when he came home this time.

214
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,880
Why?

215
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
Because he came back with a bang.

216
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,280
I'mma kick you.

217
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,320
But trust me.

218
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,400
- What?
- They'll do it again today.

219
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,320
- Believe me.
- The fourth round?

220
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,240
What did you say to them?

221
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,760
Nothing.

222
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,120
Believe me, it's really nothing.

223
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,200
By the way, why were you
so energetic today? Hmm?

224
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,000
All the girls were
screaming their lungs out.

225
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,800
You know the reason.

226
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,080
Because of me?

227
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,480
Then...

228
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
If you behave...

229
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,240
...I'll let you do it again.

230
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,080
What if I...

231
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,560
...act up?

232
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,360
I'll still let you do it, but less.

233
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,800
I think Leo's team will
see us in the final this year.

234
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,920
Need something?

235
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,160
I want to apologize.

236
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,920
I was too impulsive that day.

237
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm sorry I slapped you.

238
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,360
So you wanna keep it
casual with me this time?

239
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,440
Can't I?

240
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,320
Maybe yes or maybe no.

241
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,560
Don't tell me it's because
of that dull-face senior?

242
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,360
Wait, Leon!

243
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,920
Still angry with me?

244
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,960
I'm not angry.

245
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,600
I met P' Pob because of you.

246
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,760
Oh, and another thing.

247
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,120
Next time, don't look
for me for a hook-up.

248
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,760
Because I'm serious about P' Pob.

249
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,080
Are you angry?

250
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,320
I swear there's nothing
between me and Nina.

251
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,880
Ever since I met you,
I've stopped fooling around.

252
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,560
I'm not angry.

253
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,040
Then why did you run away?

254
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,080
Please believe that
there's nothing going on.

255
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,040
I even stopped partying,
fooling around, and everything.

256
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,520
I said I'm not angry.

257
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,840
Then why...

258
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm jealous.

259
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
P' Pob, wait for me!

260
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,679
Leon.

261
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,800
Leon, wake up.

262
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,120
It's getting late.

263
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,000
What are you playing at?

264
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,480
I'm not playing.

265
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,640
You said you were
doing an assignment.

266
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,240
So I waited until you finish
so that we could chat.

267
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,280
It's late, you're not going home?

268
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,480
No.

269
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,160
I'll stay here until we're
clear about your jealousy.

270
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,480
It's just jealousy.
No big deal.

271
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,160
But it's a big deal for me.

272
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
This is the first time you're jealous.

273
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,720
What? I can't get jealous?

274
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,600
Of course you can.
You can do everything.

275
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
Then...

276
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,760
I'm jealous.

277
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,080
I think I'd better go.

278
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,960
If I stay any longer,
you'll be in danger.

279
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,280
You said your head was full of me.

280
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,360
What do you mean by this?

281
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,200
Don't tell me
I haven't said I love you?

282
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,480
Well...

283
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,520
I admit that I liked you
since the first time I saw you.

284
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,720
I don't know when I fell in love with you.

285
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,560
Maybe when you were kind to me.

286
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,960
Or when you were with Pobjer.

287
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,520
I really don't know.

288
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
But the next thing I know...

289
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
..all I think about is you.

290
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,040
If this is love, then I love you.

291
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,120
Please don't be so cute.
Now I don't wanna leave.

292
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,120
Then stay.

293
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,720
Can I?

294
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,200
Don't ask again.

295
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,280
Thank you for waiting.

296
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,360
P' Pob, look at me.

297
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,840
I'm embarrassed.

298
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,200
Why are you embarrassed?
I belong to you.

299
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,160
Look at me.

300
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,080
It's obvious that you're very experienced.

301
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,400
But from now on, I'll use
what I've learned with you only.

302
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,080
What's on your mind?

303
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,960
Hmm?

304
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,080
You're frowning.

305
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,280
Don't tease me now.

306
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,240
My brother's been quiet lately,
so I'm teasing you instead of him.

307
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,480
Stop talking about him
or he'll show up.

308
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,120
I'm thinking about the tournament.

309
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,720
If we keep winning the games...

310
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,600
- ...then we'll face...
- King.

311
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,360
Yeah.

312
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,560
I don't know what tricks
he has up his sleeves.

313
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,400
But I won't fall for it this time.

314
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,360
But he's terrifying.

315
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,840
I know.

316
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But I'm going to beat him this time.

317
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,640
Okay.

318
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,800
What's up?

319
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,800
My brother wants to talk to you.

320
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,000
Leon, I've put you on speakerphone.

321
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,400
Hello, what do you want?

322
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,760
Nothing much, P' Fiat.

323
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,320
I'm just calling to say that my
boyfriend's way cuter than you.

324
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,400
The hell are you playing at?

325
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,280
Nothing.

326
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,400
I love, respect, and worship P' Leo.

327
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,560
But I must say that my boyfriend
is way better than P' Leo's.

328
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,080
So you're just calling to piss me off?

329
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,000
Can't face the truth?

330
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,440
P' Pob's prettier, cuter, and nicer.

331
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,800
You can't compare to him.

332
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,800
Go fuck yourself, you little shit!

333
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,560
Take it away.

334
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,680
The hell he's playing at?

335
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,920
Leo, have I told you
that I hate your brother?

336
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,680
Why did he call me?

337
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,160
You said it often
that I'm used to it.

338
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,280
But I still think that
you're cuter than P' Pob.

339
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,960
I dare you to think I'm not cute.

340
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,040
What?

341
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,520
P' Pob, you weren't sleeping?

342
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,000
You were loud.

343
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,360
- And talking nonsense.
- I was showing off my boyfriend.

344
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,720
Whose boyfriend are you? So cute!

345
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,720
But you didn't have to tell anyone.

346
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,800
I only told my brother.

347
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,320
Actually, I wanna tell my family
how serious I am with you.

348
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,280
I'm sleepy.

349
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Then let's sleep.
I'm sleepy too.

350
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,080
Didn't you sleep a lot already?

351
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,400
It's because I suddenly feel sleepy
when I hug your warm body.

352
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,880
Come on, P' Pob.

353
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,120
Don't chase me away.
Please let me stay the night.

354
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,600
Please.

355
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,400
Pretty please.
Pleaseeee.

356
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,360
I know you planned this.

357
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,280
Hello, P' Leo.

358
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,640
Need something?

359
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,840
I can't greet you if I don't
have business with you?

360
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,600
I've heard your parents
are staying in Thailand right now.

361
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,600
My family wants to visit them.

362
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,960
You can tell your father
to contact my father.

363
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,000
Can't you tell your father for me, P' Leo?

364
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,960
I can't, I've moved out.

365
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,560
Oh, my family's invited
to this year's banquet.

366
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,000
It's expected, since your
father and mine are close.

367
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,440
Oh, my father really wants to meet you.

368
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,120
And why is that?

369
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:06,200
I told him that you're good
at studying and sports.

370
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,600
It's been a while since he's seen
you, so he wants to meet you.

371
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,280
He can see me at the banquet.

372
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,720
Please excuse me, I'm
meeting up with my friends.

373
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,440
Okay.

374
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,600
[Games Schedule]

375
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,640
- Aek.
- Hey, Fiat.

376
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,120
Why are you at Pol. Sci. buliding?

377
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,360
Huh, can't I come?
My boyfriend studies in this building.

378
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,400
That's not what I meant.

379
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,400
But every time class ends,
Leo always runs off to you.

380
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,120
So I rarely see you come here.

381
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,560
But my twin often see
Leo at your building.

382
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,720
So have you seen Leo?

383
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,920
I called him, but he didn't pick up.

384
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,720
Oh, some juniors called him over
to discuss Bye Nior party.

385
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,920
The girls still can't
decide this year's theme.

386
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,120
Last I've heard, they wanna see
Leo dress up as Count Dracula.

387
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,520
Dream on, I won't let them see.

388
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,040
Possessive, aren't you?

389
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,680
If you're looking for Leo,
the girls dragged him there.

390
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,480

Science students
are gonna beat me!

402

Huh? What did you say?

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,360
Are you deaf?
They're gonna beat me!

404
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,840
It's you, Nam.
You pissed them off!

405
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,200
You used cheesy pick-up
lines with their women.

406

Aek, come help us ASAP.
We're running around like dogs now.
