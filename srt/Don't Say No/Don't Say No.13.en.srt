00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Special Episode:
"When My Heart Says I Love You"

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,000
Three Years Later

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,920
Good.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Nice.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,040
Keep changing poses.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,920
Good.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,120
Excellent, Nong Leon.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,360
Nice.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
Can you show your left side?

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,440
Good.

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Everyone, I'll take my leave now.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,440
Oh? How about joining us for dinner first?

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,360
Oh, I'm really sorry.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,960
My brother's returning from
England, so I'm going to pick him up.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,400
You can invite me some other time.
I'll definitely go.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,000
- See you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,160
Goodbye.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,960
Hey, the brother Leon was talking about.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,560
Is it the one he mentioned during
the interview for a family magazine?

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,720
The one who's tall and handsome,
yet quiet and solemn.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,039
Yeah, that's the one.
Everyone in this family's good looking.

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,120
Yeah, his brother
should become a model.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,560
He's on different path.

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,840
Leon said the brother he's
proud of is a diplomat-to-be.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,400
Wow, I wonder how this
family raised their kids.

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,479
The big brother's
a diplomat-to-be.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
While the little brother's
a commercial prince.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,039
- I'm jealous.
- Me too.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Don't rub your eyes.
They'll get bloodshot.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm sleepy.

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,800
Then why don't you sleep instead
of playing games through the flight?

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,720
I couldn't sleep.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,240
Because you're excited
to return to Thailand?

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,320
Who's excited? Nonsense.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,880
I don't miss anyone in particular.

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,760
Then what about the souvenirs
in those two suitcases?

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,440
Is this what you call
not missing anyone in particular?

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,520
Don't be stubborn.

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,280
We haven't been back
to Thailand for two years.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,280
Who could I be thinking of?

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,320
Since you've always been with me.

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
That's so sweet of you.

43
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm always sweet.

44
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,200
It's time to open the window shade.

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,320
Oh, okay.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,480
That's for being so sweet.

47
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,120
You sly fox.

48
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,720
Excuse me, are you P' Leon?

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Yes.

50
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,560
Mind if we get a picture with you?

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,480
We're your fans.
We watch your every video.

52
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,600
Sure.

53
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,200
- Thank you.
- Yes.

54
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,960
Keep up the good work.
We'll cheer you on.

55
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,400
Thank you.

56
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,040
Wow, we were gone for only two years,
but your bro's already got a fanbase?

57
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,880
I've missed you so
goddamn much, P' Leo!

58
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
How delightful.

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,080
Why is the first person I encounter have to
be the one who steals my boyfriend's love?

60
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
Get it through your head.
P' Leo's mine.

61
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,680
Are you the same guy who
took pictures with those girls?

62
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,800
Why?

63
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,640
But you know, right?

64
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,960
In the bedroom,
your brother's all mine.

65
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,120
'Your brother's all mine.'

66
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,840
- What?
- What?

67
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,360
- He's mine.
- Who cares?

68
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
- What? He's mine!
- He's mine.

69
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,680
- Let go.
- You're bullshit.

70
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
That's enough.

71
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
I know you love each other,
but why don't we go home first?

72
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,440
- Who loves him?
- Yes, who loves him?

73
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Let's ignore him.

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,640
- Who loves you?
- Who loves you? Who are you?

75
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,320
I'm back.

76
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,799
After you went to grad school, with
P' Fiat sticking to you like a dog tick.

77
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,200
You're a dog tick!

78
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
I've been taking good
care of this house.

79
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,400
And I had people put the luggage
you sent back earlier upstairs.

80
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,960
How's it, P' Leo?
Is your brother capable?

81
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
Yeah, great job for taking
care of everything in my place.

82
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,960
Hold on, stop flattering him.

83
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,560
And who did you call a dog tick?

84
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,040
Well, two years ago...

85
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
...someone started whining when he found
out about my bro's plan to study abroad.

86
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,440
I heard my parents had to ask you for
P' Leo so that you two could be together.

87
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,560
If you aren't a dog tick
then what are you?

88
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
Sharksucker?

89
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,680
Dog faced bastard.

90
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,640
Do you know what 'death wish' is?

91
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,600
No, what is it?

92
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,040
Fine.

93
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,280
Leo!

94
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,160
Your brother always bullies me.
Don't you pity me at all?

95
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Hmm?

96
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,800
You're on my side, right?

97
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,240
P' Fiat!

98
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
You're fucking cheating.

99
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,640
Since we're finally home.

100
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,080
Are you gonna let someone
else stay in our house?

101
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,280
Hmm?

102
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,000
I heard you studied marketing.

103
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,680
But I bet you learned
the art of seduction instead.

104
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,880
Why? Want me to show my skills?

105
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,120
Hey, that's enough.

106
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,520
Okay, I give in this time.

107
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,480
For my brother's sake.

108
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,800
After you get enough rest, don't
forget to stop by the main house.

109
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,760
I'll take my leave.

110
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,960
What? Feeling possessive?

111
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,760
I already told you, don't do
this in front of other people.

112
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
Though he's my brother,
I still get possessive of you.

113
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,400
If I keep doing it,
will you punish me?

114
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,720
I'll smack your butt.

115
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,440
Hey, Leo!
Anything but this, it hurts!

116
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,240
I won't argue with you anymore.

117
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,720
Better organize the house.

118
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm back.

119
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,640
He's never given you a reply
in all these three years.

120
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,400
You should get it by now, Pob.

121
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,520
Let's not bother him.

122
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,440
What's up, P' Nam?

123
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,320
You're still asking?

124
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,240
It's about our plan to
take Leo and Fiat on a trip.

125
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
I emailed the details to you.
Why haven't you replied?

126
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,440
Did you not get it or what?

127
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,400
To which address did you send it?

128
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,840
Leon Leopard something.

129
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,080
Oh, I forgot the password, so I
haven't used this email for a year.

130
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Send the file to my LINE ID.
I'll check it now.

131
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Okay.

132
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,880
Tomorrow's gonna be fun.

133
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,840
Did they really believe everyone
was too busy to pick them up?

134
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,120
I bet Fiat's gonna be shocked.

135
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,360
Okay, see you.

136
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,040
So what's the email's password?

137
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Forget it.

138
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,160
- What are you reading?
- The book I haven't finished.

139
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,520
Must you finish it now?

140
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
No, why?

141
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,560
So warm.
The AC is very cold.

142
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,880
You sure it's because of the AC?

143
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,080
I love when you wear all black.
You look so cool.

144
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,040
You smell nice.

145
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
I smell nice from head to toe.

146
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,640
Can you tell me now
why you're acting coquettishly?

147
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Because you'll start working at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs next week.

148
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm afraid you won't have time for me.

149
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,080
Have I ever not had time for you?

150
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,440
No.

151
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,640
Whether it's when we studied here, or
when we studied abroad, or whenever.

152
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,280
I'll always have time for you.

153
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,800
Don't be afraid, I'm always here
to let you act coquettishly with me.

154
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,440
But there must be pretty women
and handsome men at your workplace.

155
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
I don't care if they're
pretty or handsome.

156
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,040
I already have someone who's
both pretty and handsome right here.

157
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,320
Why is my boyfriend becoming
prettier and cuter by the day?

158
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,040
I'm scared my hubby won't
be smitten with me anymore.

159
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,120
Turn around and let me kiss you.

160
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,360
Now do you know why I
haven't finished that book?

161
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,400
Come on, let's go to bed.
It's been a long day.

162
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,320
We still need to unpack tomorrow.

163
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Fine.

164
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,720
But you've got to hold
me tight while we sleep.

165
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,360
'Cause the AC's cold.

166
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,600
- Wake the hell up!
- Wake up!

167
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,840
How long are you gonna sleep?
Fuck! Take it easy, man!

168
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,520
- Calm down, calm down.
- It's us. It's us.

169
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,960
Relax.

170
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,560
Tho, you gave Leo a gun, right?

171
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,080
- I didn't! It's probably my bro.
- Take it easy.

172
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,920
Damn, what are you
guys doing at our house?

173
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,840
- Nam, tell them.
- You tell them!

174
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,000
Fiat asked you.
Why aren't you answering?

175
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,560
Damn, not only you're possessive,
but you've also gotten fiercer.

176
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,760
Answer me!

177
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,080
We... we... we just wanna
invite you guys on a trip.

178
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,360
Calm down.

179
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,880
Easy, dude.

180
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,640
- It's dangerous.
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

181
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,880
It's dangerous. Let me
take care of it. Give it to me.

182
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,800
- Easy, dude. Easy.
- Shit, be careful.

183
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,000
Nam, they don't have a gun anymore!

184
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,400
- Let's take a trip!
- Charge!

185
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
- Hurry up!
- Get up!

186
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,600
No, I don't wanna.

187
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,560
- Nam!
- Come on, go wash up!

188
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,360
- Hurry up, Fiat!
- I'm begging you, dude.

189
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,240
Get up! Get up! Get up!

190
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,080
Come on! Come on!

191
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,800
- Hurry and get up!
- Let's go on a vacay!

192
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,960
Wow!

193
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,680
I feel so stiff.

194
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,560
What a nice weather.

195
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,960
So can you guys tell us now
why you brought us here?

196
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,040
To play basketball in this
mountain surrounded area.

197
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,640
Yeah, and to kayak in this
mountain surrounded area.

198
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,240
- Don't copy my joke.
- Why? It's copyrighted?

199
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,200
- Try come up with new jokes.
- Got a problem?

200
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,040
Haven't seen you guys for
two years, you're still the same.

201
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,120
Of course, and we've become
more handsome as well.

202
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,120
I told you the kidnapping
plan was stupid.

203
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,600
You could've just called and
asked them nicely to come.

204
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,680
Then it wouldn't be a surprise, bro.

205
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
Yeah.

206
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,320
Actually, we...

207
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,320
By we, I mean An, Nat and me.
We wanted to see you guys.

208
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
We wanted to pick
you up at the airport.

209
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,880
But these brainless pricks
wanted to make up for lost time.

210
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,320
So they planned a trip
before you started working.

211
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,440
- They'd be too busy by then.
- That's right.

212
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,440
This place is one of An's family's resorts.
She's reserved a villa for you.

213
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,720
You should stay there.
Don't mind them.

214
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
I missed you guys.

215
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,320
Me too. Come on, let's get
inside. The girls are waiting.

216
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,680
- Your bro's got a big mouth.
- I think so too.

217
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,520
- But they're too serious, unlike us.
- He's right.

218
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,760
We did this because we
were worried about you.

219
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,880
It's been a while.
I missed you so much.

220
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,960
Yeah.

221
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
- Let go of me!
- No.

222
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,560
That's enough. Enough!

223
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,280
How did I become
friends with you guys?

224
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,800
Oh?

225
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,360
- He's annoyed with you.
- With you!

226
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,040
I'm gonna follow my friend.

227
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,320
Stay still.

228
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
My turn yet?

229
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,800
Looks like the camera's broken.
Just go to the photo studio.

230
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,000
What?

231
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,080
- We've got lots of photos, though.
- But none of me!

232
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,840
Come on, just go take one
at the photo studio I saw over there.

233
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Guys, what did you
wanna ask me earlier?

234
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,600
What else would we ask you?

235
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,480
We just wanna catch up with you.

236
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Yes.

237
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,880
Oh, why does a swimmer
wear a helmet in the pool?

238
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,240
Whoa, you fucking asshole!

239
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,120
If I knew, I wouldn't have been
teased by you guys for years.

240
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,200
What a joke.

241
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,280
Keep it.

242
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,680
The answer is,
because he's crazy.

243
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,120
Teasing you despite
having been worried about you.

244
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,800
They only annoy you to
cover up their awkwardness.

245
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Actually, they've been dying to know
if you were doing fine over there.

246
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,280
Who's worried about him?
Not me.

247
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,720
Yeah, not me too.
I just want the souvenirs.

248
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,040
He's worried.

249
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,320
An went to study abroad with
you guys and came back first.

250
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,040
She said you had a really hard
time adjusting to life there at first.

251
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,680
So they were worried.

252
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,000
It was exhausting at first.

253
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,240
But after I got used to the life
there, things had gotten better.

254
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,840
Actually, it's because Leo
had always been by my side.

255
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,080
Whoa, always by your side?

256
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,080
Okay, fine.

257
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,880
Before coming back, we
barely had time for each other.

258
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,480
'Cause we were both busy.

259
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,960
And he's gonna start
working right after returning?

260
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
My friend's so pitiful.

261
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,960
Isn't it because you
dragged me here?

262
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,160
- Yeah, you!
- I agree.

263
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,800
Otherwise, I would've
spent some time with him.

264
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,280
Okay.

265
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,280
But this is fine too.
I also missed you guys.

266
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,880
- My friend's words...
- ...are so touching!

267
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,160
Love you!

268
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
So fake.

269
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,520
Enough already.
I know, thank you.

270
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,480
- Buddy.
- Stop faking it.

271
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,480
Come on, let's take more photos.

272
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,800
- I'll be the photographer.
- Count me in.

273
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,080
Come on.

274
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,360
You always look at him that way
no matter how much time passes.

275
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,800
You're still not used to it?

276
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Thanks so much anyway.

277
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,320
Fiat's been exhausted
following me all these years.

278
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,240
I'm glad to see him smiling.

279
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,520
Oh, but don't let Tho and Nam
come up with a plan next time.

280
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,120
I almost shot them.

281
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,640
I never asked them to.
They did everything on their own.

282
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,280
Right, are you gonna start
working right away?

283
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Yeah, I actually had to start sooner.

284
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,000
But one of Fiat's classes
wrapped up later than scheduled.

285
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,760
We hurried back as soon
as I took care of everything.

286
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
So you haven't had
some alone time with him?

287
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,640
No, we've been together all the time.

288
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,760
We probably won't
have a chance to meet.

289
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
Yes, P' Nam.

290
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,680
Sorry, work suddenly comes up.
Guess I won't be able to join you.

291
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,560
Please take care of my brother
and sister-in-law for me.

292
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,000
Especially my sister-in-law.
He's super worrisome.

293
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,560
He was like a sad puppy living there.
Hope he feels better after coming back.

294
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,000
Yes. Okay. See you. Okay.

295
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,280
Shouldn't have forgotten my clothes.

296
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
You're so pretty.

297
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
I told you to call me handsome.

298
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,680
Why does it have to be me?

299
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,240
Because no one's let
me try my skills with them.

300
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,160
Who'd let you try?

301
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,440
I told you I signed up
for makeup courses.

302
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,480
I'm gonna turn you into a beauty
whom Leo can't take his eyes off.

303
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,320
I'm already a beauty.

304
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,800
Where do you get
that confidence from?

305
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,400
From my hubby's obsession with me.

306
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Come on, pretty please.
You can remove it if it turned out bad.

307
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,640
- Fine.
- Yeah!

308
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
Okay, let's start.

309
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
Look up.

310
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,160
- Do it well.
- Alright.

311
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,480
I'll make him gawk.

312
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,640
- Can I really trust her?
- Of course!

313
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,640
- I'm confident.
- Okay.

314
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,960
Wrong side!

315
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,040
- Just kidding.
- Oh, okay.

316
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,640
They prepared this for us?

317
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,560
Yeah, I guess they feel guilty.

318
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,480
Because they suddenly
told me to dress up.

319
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,440
Suddenly put the bouquet in my hands.

320
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,120
And suddenly told me to come here.

321
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,800
Guess I can say we're on vacation.

322
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,760
It reminds me of when we went to Santorini,
which was a surprise trip from you.

323
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,040
You said you wanted to go there
when you were grounded by your dad.

324
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,360
When we first moved abroad,
you took me to many places.

325
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,040
I knew you were trying to help
me cope with my homesickness.

326
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,480
And did you like it?

327
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,600
Yes.

328
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Especially when
a Greek guy hit on me.

329
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,360
I thought you were more
than two meters tall at that time.

330
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,720
Your intimidating aura
scared the shit out of him.

331
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,400
Aww, come on. Don't sulk.

332
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,400
I'll never look at anyone else but you.

333
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,320
I dare you to try.

334
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, I gave you an inch
and you took a mile.

335
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,760
But I remember you
like it when I'm fierce.

336
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm so happy.

337
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,679
For getting kidnapped?

338
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,719
For being with you.

339
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,560
Next time, let's come here together.

340
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,280
Okay.

341
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,680
Let's come here again.

342
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,240
Let's go to our room?

343
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,840
Wait.

344
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,240
Why?

345
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,040
Go wash up.

346
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,640
Please go wash up.

347
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,840
Pretty please.

348
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,920
Please. Go wash up first.

349
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,120
Fine.

350
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,880
Ah! Go.

351
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,160
Go on. Hurry up. Go.

352
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,440
I told you, don't tempt me.

353
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,600
What would you do
if I'm being rough?

354
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,160
And you're a loud moaner too.

355
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Well...

356
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,400
Natsu said everyone's
going out to have fun.

357
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,400
They'll be back at midnight.

358
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,440
So we have two hours.

359
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,360
What do you think?

360
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,320
Before we came back,
we were very busy.

361
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,400
Besides, this shirt.

362
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
You bought it for me.

363
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,480
- And you said you...
- ...wanna take if off.

364
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,320
Yes, I said it.

365
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,880
And now, I fucking wanna rip it off.

366
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,640
Do what you want.

367
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,760
Don't ever let anyone see you
wear makeup or dress like this.

368
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,080
Got it?

369
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,080
Yeah, I promise.

370
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,600
Do you hear anything?

371
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,080
I can't hear anything at all.

372
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,360
Hey, hey.

373
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,280
But I think I hear something.

374
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,640
- Huh?
- Sounds like radio static.

375
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,840
Something like, hisss, hisss.
Just listen.

376
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,680
- You sure it's fucking radio static?
- Just listen.

377
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,720
I hear bed hitting the floor.

378
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,800
Huh? I can't hear it.

379
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,000
If Leo finds out,
he's gonna kill you.

380
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,040
You lied to him that we all went out.

381
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,000
Nam, put your phone away.
You know how possessive Leo is of Fiat.

382
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,480
Like a mother dog who's
possessive of her pup?

383
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,840
Hey, Nam! I hear something.
Sounds like a bed moving.

384
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
Like...

385
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,280
- You hear it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,720
- What? I don't hear anything.
- Just listen carefully.

387
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,480
Yeah, I can hear it too.

388
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,040
- Huh?
- It's a pity we can't see.

389
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,480
We're not being nosy.

390
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,000
- We're just worried about our friend.
- Yeah.

391
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,880
- What if something happens?
- Yeah.

392
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,760
If that's the case,
we might be able to help.

393
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,280
Yeah, you're right.

394
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,080
That's enough, all of you.
Let's disperse before someone dies.

395
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,640
- Come on, Nat. Let's go back!
- No!

396
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,680
I wanna know the feedback.
I really worked hard on the makeup.

397
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,720
Fiat's already a natural beauty.
I only touched up his eyes.

398
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,240
Leo's blind if he's not smitten.

399
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
He's been smitten since he was young.

400
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,320
Without any makeup, Fiat
could melt him with a wink.

401
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Let's go.

402
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,960
Quiet!

403
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,600
You guys too.

404
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,800
Understand what I'm saying?

405
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,800
Yeah.

406
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,360
Are you recording?

407
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,760
Just don't drag me
into this mess with you.

408
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,520
It sounds like...

409
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,440
Oh! Sorry. I didn't mean it.

410
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,240
It's fine.

411
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,440
You're here to watch
the sunrise too?

412
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,360
Yes.

413
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,000
Are you an actor?

414
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,720
Oh, no.

415
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,480
Really? You look familiar though.

416
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,200
Your face is slim too.

417
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,760
Do you have business
with my boyfriend?

418
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,560
Umm, no.

419
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,400
Then do you mind leaving us alone?
You're intruding on our time.

420
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,960
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

421
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,800
Oh, and please delete
my boyfriend's picture.

422
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,400
He's only mine to see.

423
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,520
Yes, right away.

424
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,720
What? Feeling possessive?

425
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,240
- No.
- Oh?

426
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,640
I'm jealous.

427
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,080
What's wrong, Mr. Jelly?

428
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,520
Mr. Jelly's irrational right now.

429
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,320
I never said you were irrational.

430
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,680
I am.

431
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,680
Lately, I've been afraid you'd be
annoyed by my possessiveness.

432
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,560
I've never said that.

433
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,760
Just tell me if I make
you uncomfortable.

434
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,360
I know that after you became mine
and let me stake my claim...

435
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,280
...I've become more
possessive of you by the day.

436
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,320
I could hold myself back
in the past, but now...

437
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,320
I'm okay with it.

438
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,600
As long as you don't say that
you can't bear to see me, I'm okay.

439
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,760
Didn't we already talk about it
on our first year together?

440
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,400
We should talk to each other
to sort out any problem.

441
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,960
I don't want us to fight
like that time anymore.

442
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,240
Therefore, I'll tell you
if I'm not okay with something.

443
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,800
Do I follow my heart too much?

444
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,040
Why? Your heart
tells you to be jealous?

445
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,040
It tells me to imprison you.

446
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,280
Let me tell you a secret.

447
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,320
What secret?

448
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,480
I wanna be imprisoned, like this.

449
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,400
I love you so much.

450
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,960
I love you too.

451
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,280
I love you more.

452
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,200
I love you more.

453
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,520
I feel more.

454
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,880
Alright, I give up.
Because you're adorable.

455
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,720
Then you've got to
adore me more, okay?

456
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,800
That's for sure.

457
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,560
♪ Ever since I met
and fell in love with you ♪

458
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,880
♪ We’ve been through
a lot of thick and thin together ♪

459
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,960
♪ It makes me realize ♪

460
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,520
♪ That nobody deserves you more than me ♪
Is that a rainbow?

461
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,680
It's only been three years,
but it feels like we're worlds apart.

462
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,880
Just give up, Pob.
Nothing's the same anymore.

463
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,920
I'm hurrying as much as I can.

464
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,560
Give me 15 minutes, yeah.
That's all I really need.

465
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,520
What are you hoping for?

466
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,320
It'll never come true.

467
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,800
Why are you sitting like a sad dog?

468
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,160
Who's a sad dog?

469
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,360
All I see is a promising
handsome model relaxing on a sofa.

470
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,600
Don't you have a home to return to?

471
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,000
I do, but I don't wanna go back.

472
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,040
Someone like P' Fiat
is trying to comfort me?

473
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,640
What?

474
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,720
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

475
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,680
Yeah, but must you say it out loud?

476
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,800
Won't you be able to sleep
if you don't piss me off for a day?

477
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,880
You're not P' Leo.

478
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,480
No matter how hard
you comfort me...

479
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,880
...it's useless.

480
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,680
But your brother's not home
and will be back late.

481
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,960
I know that.

482
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,400
But staying here makes
me feel more at ease.

483
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,120
Do you still keep in touch with him?

484
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,440
I don't wanna make him uncomfortable.

485
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,080
So you still love him, right?

486
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,240
What do you think?

487
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,160
Though I don't like you...

488
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,400
...I don't wanna see my
little bro in that state again.

489
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,640
Leon.

490
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,240
P' Pob's left.

491
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,160
He left me.

492
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:16,800
I just realized how much it hurts
when you get dumped.

493
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,040
It fucking hurts.

494
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,720
It's okay.

495
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,520
You've still got us.

496
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,760
We'll always be with you.

497
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,680
I still love and think of him.

498
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,720
I believe he'll return someday.

499
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,720
At least, Pobjer's still
resting in our backyard.

500
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,160
When that day comes,
I'll set our time right.

501
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,720
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

502
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,200
Someone like P' Fiat
is comforting me.

503
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,040
It's surely gonna rain
cats and dogs toight.

504
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,760
- What?
- Ah, ah.

505
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,560
I'm not comforting you.

506
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh.

507
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,440
Stop it! I'm not comforting you!
Don't point at me.

508
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,840
I only wanted to sit here.

509
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,480
You're worried about me, right?

510
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,680
I'm worried alright, but
can you stop pissing me off?

511
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,120
Got it? Well?

512
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,080
Well? I'm not
comforting you. Got it?

513
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,680
Love is a funny thing.

514
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,760
It may come unexpectedly.

515
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,120
Thank you.

516
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
Yes.

517
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,320
I think I'm coming
back to work in Thailand.

518
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,680
Because my dream's here too.

519
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,880
Goodbye.

520
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,680
And leave when we're unprepared.

521
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,760
But it's not always cruel.

522
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,120
Because one day...

523
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,640
- Our paths will meet.
- Our paths will meet.

524
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,920
What have you been doing?
It's been hours now.

525
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,400
Choosing an outfit for
your first day of work.

526
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,640
I can wear anything.

527
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,880
You can't!

528
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,040
Mom said first impression is important.

529
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,080
And she knows you're
the type to wear anything.

530
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,800
So she asked me to help you.

531
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,480
Then do as you please.

532
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,480
As long as you pick it out,
I'll wear anything.

533
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,040
You'll wear anything
even if I don't pick it out.

534
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,240
Leo.

535
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,880
What?

536
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,720
Come try them on.

537
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,920
- All of that?
- Yeah.

538
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,000
You'll do as I please, right?

539
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,040
Hurry up!

540
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,880
- Get up!
- There are so many!

541
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,960
Come on, don't you wanna
be handsome on your first day?

542
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,680
Turn around. Yeah.

543
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,920
Again. Hurry up.

544
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,680
Turn and face me.

545
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,320
Let's change!

546
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,960
Go change.

547
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,400
No. Next.

548
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,200
Go change.

549
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,240
Next.

550
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,160
Just do it.

551
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,160
Oh?

552
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,800
I tried on so many clothes.
Don't you find one you like at all?

553
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,320
It's not like that.

554
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,760
Oh?

555
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,400
They all look good.
I can't make up my mind.

556
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,640
Does this mean I can wear anything?

557
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,840
You can do that,
but you also can't.

558
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,040
Because I want you
to wear the best outfit.

559
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,280
Aren't you afraid
people will hit on me?

560
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,320
Then wear the worst
outfit you've got tomorrow.

561
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,920
As for your hair, don't style it.
Keep it messy like this.

562
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:42,360
And wear glasses too.
Wear them and don't take them off.

563
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,400
Don't let people see your face.

564
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,000
Come.

565
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,800
What's so funny?

566
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,840
My boyfriend's becoming
cuter by the day.

567
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,720
Oh? Going to bed already?

568
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,560
Or I'll be too tired to wake up.

569
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,440
You should sleep too.

570
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,160
Or you won't be able to adjust
when you start working.

571
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,000
What?

572
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,120
Good night kiss.

573
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,760
Good night.

574
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,400
Yeah, good night.

575
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,320
You picked the first outfit in the end.

576
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,160
So, do you like it?

577
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,520
Yes.

578
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,920
I'm glad you like it.

579
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,920
No.

580
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,400
What I'm trying to say is I like you.

581
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,360
I like every time you
do something for me.

582
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,240
Take today for example.

583
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,600
I have a feeling that
I'll be lucky all day.

584
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,840
I think you're way too
head over heels for me.

585
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,840
Isn't it good?

586
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,520
It is.

587
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,120
Here.

588
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:30,840
But now, go to work.
Go. Hurry up.

589
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,320
I can't go yet.

590
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,000
Morning kiss.

591
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,760
We may have been
foolish for a long time.

592
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,920
We may have been awkward,
not knowing what lovers should do.

593
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,080
But now, we know one thing.

594
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,400

595
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,080

600
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:15,320

607
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,280
Thank you for the courage
which marks the beginning that day.

608
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,720
And changed us into who we are today.

609
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:45,920
No matter how many
years have passed.

610
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,440
I want to thank this man
for always staying by my side.

611
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:04,200
Thank our friends for
being our precious family.

612
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:19,760
...And I'm sorry for the past mistakes.

613
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,840
I know I'm not a good person.

614
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,600
But I'm going to make sure
that I'm good enough for you.

615
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:37,160
We may have been at odds
with each other in the past.

616
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,120
But we would always work it out
every time it happened.

617
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,840
Every happiness and sadness
are precious lessons...

618
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,800
...that teach us the value
of having each other.

619
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:08,640
I'm thankful for the love
that came into our lives.

620
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,279
This embrace isn't just a hug...

621
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:20,000
...but a strong armor.

622
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:40,120
Our fear of loss made us
cautious of every step we take...

623
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:49,040
...But we forgot that every
relationship needs communication.

624
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:58,480
Sorry for being unreasonable.
Sorry for making assumptions.

625
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,480
I'm sorry for the
mistakes I made at times...

626
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:12,040
...And thankful that we
stepped out of the friend zone.

627
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,960
I promise to cherish this
relationship the best I can.

628
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:29,360
Love You Forever & Always
- Leo & Fiat -

629
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:41,880
I'm thankful we were born
...to meet each other...

630
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,800
You're really not gonna take
this job? It's such a good offer.

631
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,040
We'll be working in
the same company too.

632
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,120
I'm planning to be
a freelancer for now.

633
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,920
I've got some experience
from my time in London.

634
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,360
Just give it a try.

635
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,800
Nah, my record will be affected
if I quit halfway through.

636
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,800
Huh? Why would you rush to quit?

- I heard your neck got red.
- Show us.

798
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:23,960
Sunburned?

799
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,000
I haven't seen it.

01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,080
[Poor Senggg]

801
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,560
Gotcha again.

802
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,920
There's nothing much today.

803
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,960
Since there're many actors,
we need time to be in tune again.

804
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,440
- Show me how to be in tune.
- Like this. Just kidding.

805
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,760
I mean, we haven't met for so long.

806
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,960
So when we film again...

807
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,200
...we need time to connect with each other.

808
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,640
But it went well, and now we're sunbathing.

809
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,960
How often do you two connect?
[Connect what?]

810
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,440
Here, it's all yours.

811
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,800
C.N. Right?

812
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,880
What's C.N.?

813
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,240
Connecting.

814
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,480
Let's interview our girls.

815
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,400
Hello.

01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,600
Hello.

Hello.

818
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,720
Go away. Go!!!

819
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,360
- I'm gonna interview the girls.
- Scene stealers.

820
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,440
Sorry.

821
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,400
Go away ugly people.
[Too bad you're not pretty]

822
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,880
Why are your cheeks so red?

823
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,480
It's P' Rin's doing.

824
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,560
Wait a minute.

825
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,800
Why put on the makeup?

826
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,280
To arouse Leo.

827
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,400
Arouse his anger.

828
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,400
[Here comes a joke]

829
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,960
You always crack jokes. I like it.

830
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,960
She's like this even during the filming.

831
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,160
[Man-eating bush]
Ah, it's a man-eating bush

832
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,160
It really does exist.

833
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,960
[Tokay]

834
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,200

836
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:57,960
What a good timing.

837

When My Heart Says...I Miss You

838
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,240
Listen, everyone.

839
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,920
P' James' invented a new language.

840
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,280
Come teach everyone.

841
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,480
What language?

842
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,400
[Such a strange language]
Huh?
What does it mean?

843
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,600
It means 'I'm back.'

844
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,880
Say 'I'm back, I've missed everyone. '

845
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,360
In that language one more time.

846
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,480
Eh, how to say it again?

847
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,600
Now that he's back, He's Thai again.

Was that fashion show walking?

So similar.

Very similar.

853
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,760
His walking style was very cool.

854
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,520
There's one more secret.

859

Isn't 'fresh' English?

860
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,960
It's a technical term.

861

Are you two really archenemies?

862
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,840
We must join hands.

863

How come they join hands? What am I?

864

He's the best troublemaker.

865
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,280
Say it again. I wanna practice.

866

My native language is spoken like this.

Sounds so indecent.

He walked and carried the suitcase.

He gotta kiss too?

874
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,960
Didn't you read the script?

875
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,560
It's pretty hard to get up.

876
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,240
I gotta bounce or he'll feel pain.

877

It's working, try again.

878

You said it's working.

01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,640
To get used to it.
[Do it more often, First,
to get used to it]

880

I told you, don't do this
in front of other people.

881
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,640
Even if he's my brother,
I'm still possessive.

882
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,120
Will you punish me if I do this?

883
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,480
[How to punish a naughty boy?]
Then I move my hand down.

[What are you doing, Ja!!!]

889
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,280
- You feel it's too slow.
- So you get up and rip it.

890

- I'm still not used to it.
- Don't, I'm used to it now.

So passionate.

897
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,240
Was it passionate?

898
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,360
Very. The shirt was torn.

899
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,440
Very passionate.

900
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,800
There was shirt grabbing,
dragging, and stuff.

901
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,160
Just grabbing? You call that grabbing?

902
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,280
Fine, yanking.

903
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,480
Like this?

904
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,560
- Oh, my robe.
- I'm not naked, I'm wearing pants.

905
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,280
I don't wanna say it. I can't say it.
[Just say it, First]
The hot sun...

906
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:34,640
...isn't as hot as Leo.
[A lion is always a lion]
Don't you mean yourself?

907

You ripped the shirt. Where's it?

908
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,800
Hey, isn't this a spoiler?

909
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,640
Your hands always go low.
You're doing it again.

910
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,440
- I'm gonna bring you to sit.
- Oh, okay.

911
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,160
They told me to suck his fingers.

912
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,680
Erotically.

913
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,680
[Why don't you swallow your hand?]

914
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,160

Gonna eat your finger.

916
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,280
Just a nibble.

917
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,920
My finger just took a dip.

918
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,520
- In what?
- Not in the pool.

919
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,160
We're filming in Khao Yai.
Great atmosphere for a retreat.

920
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,480
- Yeah.
- Retreat besides dinner?

921
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,920
What do want me to answer?

922
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,960
There were some candles
and stuff in the scene.

923
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,160
And it made us feel into
the characters and the scene.

924
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,080
So did you fall asleep?

925
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:20,960
Did you?

926
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,920
No. How could I? So many people here.

927
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,400
I thought you'd sleep in my arms.

928
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,080
What are you saying?
