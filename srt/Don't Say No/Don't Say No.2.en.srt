1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,120
Hurry up, it's heavy.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,720
Right here.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,800
Why am I wasting my precious weekend
by helping you guys move things?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,440
- Blame him.
- Hey!

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,680
It's you. It's Nam's idea, bro.
Besides, Leo's your friend, bro.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,440
- Don't you wanna know, bro?
- Don't bro me, you little shit.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,960
You always need a favor
when you call me that.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,760
You're just too lazy to drive,
so you wanted me to drive for you.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,400
Come on, don't you guys
wanna know about your friends?

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,560
Well?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
What kind of man moves to another house
for the sake of peaceful mind...

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,640
...just because his boyfriend's
afraid of a maid?

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,000
- Interesting.
- Besides, someone like Leo...

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,440
...doesn't bring a single maid with him.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,920
Is this devotion or complete obsession?

16
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,040
EP.2: Perhaps it's the bedroom issues?

17
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,360
Leo.

18
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
What?

19
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
Your friends bullied you?

20
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,200
It's not like that.

21
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
You didn't have to move out
from the main house.

22
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,440
I already did anyway.

23
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,520
Then move back.

24
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,160
If I move back, you won't
come to my house anymore.

25
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,280
Because you can't face Auntie Jah.

26
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,800
Didn't you promise your parents
to take good care of that house...

27
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
...if you stayed in Thailand?

28
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
But you know.

29
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
I didn't follow my parents
because I wanted to be with you.

30
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,360
So it's meaningless if you're
afraid to enter that house.

31
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,880
Leo.

32
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,560
And you don't want to
return to your house too.

33
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,520
My house used to be your comfort zone.

34
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,800
But if that house
makes you uncomfortable...

35
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,920
...I'll find a new place
that brings you happiness.

36
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,560
I dislike my home because of the people,
not the house itself.

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,200
Besides, that house carries
fond memories of my mother.

38
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
I know.

39
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,480
But what if you ran away from home again
and wouldn't come to my house?

40
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,440
Where would I find you?

41
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,040
So you're doing this for me...

42
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,680
...because you're afraid I'd have
nowhere to go if I ran away from home.

43
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,640
No.

44
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,840
If you live with me,
Uncle Mait won't be worried.

45
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,440
Can you not talk about him?

46
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,400
My dad never worries about me.

47
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
He just wants to chain me up.

48
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,920
Because he's afraid
I'd cause another problem.

49
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,760
Let's move back.

50
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,560
You've promised your mom.

51
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,520
What if she finds out
and gets angry with you?

52
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,560
What if she gets angry with me too?

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,520
What if she hates me?
Think about it.

54
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,920
Calm down.

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,760
My mom won't be angry or hate you.

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Trust me.

57
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
You've talked to her?

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Has she...

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,520
Has she found out about us?

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Hello.

61
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,680
Stop overthinking.
No one's angry or hate you.

62
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,040
But...

63
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,280
I'll handle the matter about the house.

64
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,800
As for you...

65
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
You can move in right away.

66
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,000
What? Really?

67
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,520
I can live with you?

68
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Of course.

69
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
I've already asked your dad.

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,600
Oh? For real?

71
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
Yes.

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,920
Have you really thought this through?

73
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Yes.

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,920
I want Fiat to move in with me.

75
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,680
Why?

76
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,760
We've been busy with studies lately.

77
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,320
And the house I'm moving in
is closer to the campus.

78
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,280
Can't he endure for just another year?

79
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,840
He's getting weaker by depending on you.

80
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
He can endure it.

81
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,800
But sometimes I wonder.

82
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,760
Why must he endure it?

83
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,160
Why must he endure living
in this suffocating house?

84
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,320
Leo.

85
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,040
With all due respect, Uncle.

86
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,760
Please don't torment him anymore.

87
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,560
I promise I'll take better
care of him than before.

88
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,400
Do whatever you want.

89
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,679
He's never respected
the people in this house anyway.

90
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,120
That man's really allowed it?

91
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,960
You don't believe me?

92
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,560
Because that man...

93
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,720
When I wanted him to love me,
he kicked me out of the house.

94
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,040
When I don't need him anymore,
he chains me up and won't let me go.

95
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,240
The man who hates me that much
wouldn't want me to be happy.

96
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,000
So you're saying being with me...

97
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,360
...makes you feel happy?

98
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
Hey.

99
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,240
Can I...

100
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,280
...hug you?

101
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,400
When...

102
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,400
When we were friends,
you'd never asked.

103
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,160
If you wanna hug me, just do it.

104
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,720
It's not the same.

105
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,600
I don't want you to
mistake it for a friendly hug.

106
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,560
If you wanna hug me, just do it.

107
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
Can I...

108
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,520
...continue like back then?

109
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Back then...

110
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,160
Sure.

111
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,040
Dude, I'm hung... gry.

112
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,360
You guys...

113
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,600
...are eating?

114
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,840
Is there anything left for me to eat?

115
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,240
Okay, fine. I'll order pizza.

116
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,520
Oh, Fiat.

117
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,120
Eat slowly or you'll get stomach cramps.

118
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,400
I've got stomachache from saying it.

119
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,560
Tho's quite different from Aek.

120
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,120
Tho, I'm gonna kill you!

121
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,640
Hanging out with your
boyfriend's friends drains me.

122
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,560
You mean your twin?

123
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,840
Leo, seriously.

124
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,760
Don't you think you're
spoiling Fiat too much?

125
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
I don't.

126
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,160
Of course you don't.

127
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,040
When he asked you to find
another man's address...

128
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,320
...you did, even when it hurt like hell.

129
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,960
Help me find this man's address.

130
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,000
Fiat again?

131
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,960
Yeah, help me.

132
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Leo, I'm asking this as your friend.

133
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,160
Why hurt yourself by setting
him up with someone else?

134
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,040
- I can't bear to see his tears.
- But you can bear sheding your own?

135
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Yes.

136
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,160
I can bear any pain.

137
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,440
As long as it makes him happy.

138
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,720
We were both idiots back then.

139
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,880
I didn't dare confess to him,
while he kept doing things to spite me.

140
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,800
And that put me through trouble.

141
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,200
Thanks a lot.

142
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,560
Go thank my old man's men.

143
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,440
Forget it, just be happy with him
for a long time, for my peace of mind.

144
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
I don't want to lose him as well.

145
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,880
You keep staring at your phone,
what's the matter this time?

146
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm waiting for a call from someone.

147
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Who?

148
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,320
Excuse me, make way please.

149
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,520
Excuse me, make way please.
Excuse me.

150
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,120
Hmm? How have you been?

151
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
Where did you go today, hmm?

152
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,359
What's up?

153
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
What's the rush?
The second half's just started.

154
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
Ha, how could I dawdle?

155
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,800
Last time I forgot to buy sports drinks,
you guys complained nonstop.

156
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,240
When I decided to take summer classes...

157
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,440
...I was worried sick that
you guys couldn't do anything.

158
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,240
But we managed.

159
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,760
Yeah right.

160
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,600
Managed by stuffing jerseys
inside the lockers for months.

161
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,400
I almost fainted when I saw that yesterday,
thinking I'd see maggots crawling out.

162
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,840
Dirty.

163
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,680
Fine, then we'll have to trouble you
next time, Team Manager.

164
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,000
Sure.

165
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,920
Oh, speaking of which, I feel kinda hurt.

166
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,920
While I was gone,
nobody told me at all...

167
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,360
...that you and Leo had started dating.

168
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,000
I had to find out from
the love confession clip.

169
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,760
You're hurt because you didn't know
or because you weren't part of the scheme?

170
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,200
The latter.

171
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,040
Oh, so how's the love life?

172
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,920
Well, nothing much.

173
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,960
He's still infatuated with me.

174
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,320
How confident!

175
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,000
Of course, who'd be as
charming as the team captain?

176
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,680
Ever the popular guy.
Never short of men.

177
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,120
Of course.

178
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,720
Don't be too cocky.

179
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,960
Leo has many secret admirers.

180
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,040
He's handsome, rich, talented,
and a son of a diplomat.

181
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,640
If you don't take care of him,
don't say I didn't warn you.

182
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,720
And why do I've got do that?
He should take care of me instead.

183
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,800
Besides, he's head over heels for me.

184
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay, Mr. Narcissist.

185
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,240
Ah, so why aren't you practicing?
Are you gonna stay glued to the bench?

186
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,560
My boyfriend's worried about me.

187
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,600
Do you know what he said?

188
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,520
He said I should visit the doctor today.

189
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,920
If the doctor said I'm completely
recovered, he'd let me play.

190
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,000
Wish you a long-lasting love,
with nothing coming between you two.

191
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
See you.

192
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
See you.

193
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,600
Guys, I'm leaving first. See you.

194
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,520
- See you.
- Bye.

195
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,240
How will you go home?
Want me to give you a ride?

196
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,600
Are you sure you want a third wheel?

197
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,440
It's okay, I'm meeting up with An.
She'll be here soon.

198
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,200
Just take your darling boyfriend
to the doctor.

199
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,000
P' Leo!

200
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,400
Shit, should I become a fortune teller?
It's really happening.

201
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,080
I really missed you.
I missed you so, so, so, so much.

202
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,960
Did you miss me?

203
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,560
Yeah, but I thought
you'd be back next week.

204
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
It's because I missed you.

205
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
No.

206
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,400
Thank you.

207
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,720
I thought you'd be back next week.

208
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,560
Surprise!

209
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,520
I missed you.
I wanted to see you sooner.

210
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,520
He shouldn't have come back.

211
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,240
P' Fiat.

212
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,040
- What?
- It's been a long time.

213
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,240
But you're still as short as ever.

214
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,960
Besides having a pug face,
you bark like a dog too?

215
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,600
Who says I'm a dog?

216
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
With my handsomeness,
I'm king of the beasts.

217
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,720
Leo, look at your little brother.
What's with his cheesy lines?

218
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,360
- Eww.
- Move.

219
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
No way.

220
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,920
Move.

221
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,080
P' Leo, I haven't been back for so long.
I missed you very much.

222
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,400
But why have you moved out
when I finally came back?

223
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
I don't wanna sleep alone in that house.

224
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,640
What do you mean 'alone'?
Lots of people live there.

225
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,720
It's not the same, I missed only you.

226
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,760
I'm your brother.
Aren't you gonna indulge me?

227
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,520
You hurt my feelings.

228
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,840
Eww, you're a grown ass man.
You think you're so cute?

229
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,280
Let's talk about that later.

230
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,040
I've heard you won't be staying
temporarily this time.

231
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,520
Are you back for good?

232
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,840
For good?

233
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,880
Why?

234
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,040
Leon's moving back to Thailand for good.
We'll be seeing each other more often.

235
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,760
That reminds me of our childhood.

236
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,080
Have your legs gotten long
enough to catch up with us?

237
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,560
Leo, I hate your brother.

238
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Bastard.

239
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,720
P' Leo, he hates me.

240
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,200
Get a new boyfriend?
You can find a better one than him.

241
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,040
Leo, look at your brother!

242
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,080
Wanna piece of me?

243
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,720
Leo, look at him.
Look what he's doing.

244
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,680
- Get up.
- No, leave me alone.

245
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,360
Dammit, Leon! You Dalmatian!

246
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,200
I thought I'd never have to
see him again in this life.

247
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,560
I'm sorry on my brother's behalf.

248
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,160
Why are you apologizing on his behalf?

249
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,320
He should've stayed there.
Why did he have to come back?

250
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,400
But he made a sacrifice by going
with my parents so I could stay here.

251
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,040
You know full well that
Leon was very attached to me.

252
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,040
And you know that he
was afraid of strangers.

253
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,640
Making new friends
was even harder for him.

254
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,400
But he was still willing
to move away with Dad.

255
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Because he proposed that
one of us must accompany Mom.

256
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,520
I got to stay while he had to go.

257
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,560
His dream was to come home.

258
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,800
But...

259
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,280
You've already seen it,
he loves to bully me.

260
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,480
And I'm scared that
he'll take you away from me.

261
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,920
What?

262
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,800
Why are you smiling?

263
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,600
Ugh, I'm gonna sleep!

264
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,320
Sweet dreams.

265
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,560
Yeah, sweet dreams.

266
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,480
If I make a move,
will he think I'm a slut?

267
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,480
If I do it, will he think
I'm taking advantage of him?

268
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,480
If I throw myself at him,
will he call me easy?

269
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,440
But...

270
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,920
But all this time, I've only
wanted to throw myself at him.

271
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,840
Though I want it,
I want to cherish him.

272
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,200
I don't want to be viewed like
the other men who only want sex.

273
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,040
- I want to do it.
- I want to do it.

274
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,960
Fiat.

275
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
I'm gonna go sleep in my room.

276
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,200
I'm going now.

277
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,840
Sweet dreams.

278
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,120
Maybe I didn't satisfy him enough?

279
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
Hold it in, Fiat.

280
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,920
Don't make Leo think
you're horny all the time.

281
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,720
Lychee soda, please.

282
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,680
Thank you.

283
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,160
Iced latte, please.

284
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,920
Hot news for single ladies.

285
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,280
I'd like to introduce a diplomat's son
with good looks and hot bod.

286
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,560
If you fell in love with Leo,
a political science prince.

287
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,840
It's okay, girls.

288
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,840
Though your heart's broken,
wipe away your tears, drown your sorrows.

289
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,480
And start anew with Nong Leon,
who's a Leo just like his brother.

290
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,760
A naive inter program freshman
whose body will make you swoon.

291
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,320
But is he really naive?

292
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,640
You have to ask the people
who'd eaten, oops, dated him.

293
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,280
The pretty boy has dated
different partners during the first week.

294
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,920
Ah, but this kind-hearted admin
will give you more details.

295
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,840
Whether you're female,
male, or nonbinary.

296
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,200
If you're confident,
charge forward to Nong Leon.

297
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,720
Because he secretly told me that...

298
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,880
...he doesn't mind the gender
of the one he likes at all.

299
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,120
I've met this guy before.
He's totally handsome.

300
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,320
The big brother's cold.
The little brother's hot.

301
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,080
Oh, I don't know who to choose.

302
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,360
That's right, this brother's
a year younger than P' Leo.

303
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,880
And was born under the Leo sign too.

304
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,040
Be gone, Thot! He's mine!!!

305
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,840
Finders keepers.
I'm gonna make him mine!!!

306
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,600
Hey, have you seen P' Leo's little brother?

307
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,120
He has a brother?

308
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,840
Newly transferred to inter program.
He's as hot as a model.

309
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,880
- Really? Let me see his pic.
- Sure, I'll search from IG.

310
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,280
Oh, over there. That's the guy.

311
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,080
He already has a girlfriend?

312
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
But he claims he's single.

313
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,040
She's not even pretty.

314
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,480
- I'm prettier.
- I suit him better.

315
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,280
Just approach him already.

316
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,960
Are you nuts?

317
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,200
The big brother's dating a man.

318
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,920
But they say the younger one's straight.

319
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,920
I even saw him walking
with the com arts belle.

320
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,600
I'll embarrass myself
if I approach him.

321
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,080
Says who?

322
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,160
I've heard he's pansexual.

323
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
- Are you serious?
- Hell yeah.

324
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,840
If he likes you,
gender's not the problem.

325
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,920
But he's got one condition.

326
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,040
- What is it?
- No strings attached.

327
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,600
So that guy is Leo's brother, right?

328
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,440
He's the talk of the town now.

329
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,200
Why are you bringing him up?
It's polluting my ears.

330
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,520
Hey, that's your boyfriend's brother.

331
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,680
His brother, not mine.

332
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,240
You know what? I almost softened up
and saw him in a good light.

333
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,160
And Leo said that he's returned
because he missed his home.

334
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,840
Missed his home my ass!

335
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,520
I bet he's back because
he had his fill of fun over there.

336
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,320
That's why he came back to piss me off.

337
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,040
I guess he's having fun.
I've heard he's made a senior cry.

338
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,560
Can you stop talking about him?

339
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,960
It's pissing me off!

340
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,200
Ah, is it because the rumor
that Leon's attached to his brother?

341
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,240
He's been interrupting you guys?

342
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,880
Come on, tell me please.

343
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,199
An said Leo's been acting strange lately.

344
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,440
Or maybe...

345
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,239
...you have no time to do the deed?

346
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,560
Hey!

347
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,159
Or he couldn't satisfy you?

348
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,360
Leo's rough, I'm telling you!

349
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,159
Tell me more.

350
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,320
Well, it's nothing.

351
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,679
- Just bedroom issues.
- Huh? What did you say?

352
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,280
Nothing, I didn't say anything.

353
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,880
Let's practice.

354
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,120
Oh, still not moving?

355
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,440
An, have you heard?

356
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,080
Fiat and Leo have bedroom issues.

357
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,240
Have you heard about Leo and Fiat?

358
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,960
About what?

359
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,160
They have bedroom issues.
Incompatible, I guess.

360
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,920
Huh, is it true, bro?

361
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,760
But Fiat's acting normal.

362
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,560
Fine, I'll go check on him.

363
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,800
I know, I won't tell anyone.

364
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,760
Nam, have you heard about Fiat?

365
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,920
What about him?

366
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,080
- You mustn't tell anyone.
- Alright.

367
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,040
My bro said they've got bedroom issues.

368
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,520
Damn!

369
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,240
Maybe Leo couldn't satisfy our friend?

370
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,760
I think so too.

371
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,080
Hey, come closer. Come closer.

372
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,680
- Have you heard about Fiat and Leo?
- No.

373
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,480
- They've got bedroom issues.
- Really?

374
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,880
You guys.

375
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,000
- Have you heard about Fiat and Leo?
- What about them?

376
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,240
- They've got bedroom issues.
- Huh?

377
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,320
- Hey guys, have you heard?
- What?

378
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,440
P' Leo and P' Fiat have bedroom issues.

379
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,920
- What!
- Really?

380
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,080
Yeah, and you mustn't
tell anyone about this.

381
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,120
Okay, we won't tell a soul.

382
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,280
- Hey Leon, have you heard?
- What?

383
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,600
Your brother and his boyfriend
have bedroom issues.

384
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,800
- Huh! What did you say?
- It's true, the whole campus knows.

385
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,200
Shit.

386
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,160
Is it true, P' Leo?

387
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,960
What?

388
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,360
About you...

389
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,120
...having erectile dysfunction,
and fight with P' Fiat.

390
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,200
What?

391
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,200
There's been a rumor
that my big brother...

392
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
...can't get it up.

393
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,960
And have bedroom issues with P' Fiat.

394
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,640
P' Leo, you're only 20 something.

395
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,120
Stop, that's enough, Leon.
Where did you hear it from?

396
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,640
Mine...

397
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,960
...works just fine.

398
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,400
If there's someone with
bedroom issues, it would be you.

399
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,640
Oh?

400
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,960
What about the rumor?

401
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,280
Yeah. Where did you hear it from?

402
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,400
My friend told me,
but I don't know the source.

403
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,720
An, have you heard?

404
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Fiat and Leo have bedroom issues.

405
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,760
I only know that you and P' Fiat
have bedroom issues.

406
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,000
Another source told me
P' Fiat isn't happy to date only you.

407
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,080
Where are you going?
I'm still talking.

408
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,360
So you really can't get it up?

409
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,760
P' Leo. Oh?

410
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,360
Hold on, I'm still talking.

411
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,200
Where's he going?

412
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,280
I don't think P' Leo can't get it up.

413
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,120
But I believe he can't satisfy
someone like that guy.

414
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,440
Think about it, what kind of man
changes partners like underwear?

415
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,000
P' Leo can't never reign him in
'cause he's easy.

416
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,680
Hey, aren't you exaggerating?

417
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,720
I'm telling the truth!

418
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,240
I still don't understand
what P' Leo sees in him.

419
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,840
And you too. Why did you enjoy
that love confession clip so much?

420
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,320
I find it nauseating, though.

421
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,320
I really wonder how long P' Fiat
can stop hooking up with men.

422
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,840
Hey, keep it down.

423
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,320
But it's true!

424
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,200
Wanna hear the truth
without assuming things?

425
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,520
It might help open
a certain jealous woman's eyes.

426
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,760
Are you talking to me?

427
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,280
Why don't you use your brain to think?

428
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,680
You'd better mind your own business
instead of being nosy.

429
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,040
Changing underwear or men,
it's still my affairs.

430
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,120
Oh, and I'll tell you this as a favor.

431
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,920
Leo and I are still very much in love.

432
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,000
So there's no place for hungry
ghosts to beg for leftovers.

433
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,280
Don't scream, I'm not done yet.

434
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,800
And my boyfriend's so great at sex
that I've forgotten all the men.

435
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,240
It's a pity that you'll never
know because he's mine.

436
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,400
Keep up your cocky facade.
Who would want a lecher like you?

437
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,320
Don't speak like that to my boyfriend.

438
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,040
P' Leo.

439
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,400
Though you're my junior,
I won't give you face...

440
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,120
...if you talk to my boyfriend like that.

441
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,440
Especially the one I love this much.

442
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,360
You okay?

443
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,320
I'm fine.

444
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,560
Let's go.

445
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,840
He's too harsh!

446
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,280
What are you looking at!

447
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,400
Are you okay?

448
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Yeah, I'm fine.

449
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,600
Really?

450
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,240
Yeah.

451
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,600
So...

452
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,480
Is there anything you want to tell me?

453
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,200
No, nothing.

454
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,600
I know I'm not good at...

455
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,240
...that kind of stuff.

456
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,360
But I'll try to do it the way you like.

457
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,200
And I know that our first time happened
because you needed a company.

458
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,600
But my performance
might not be as good...

459
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,320
...as other people who...

460
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,080
...who'd been with you.

461
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,560
- But I'll try harder. I'll...
- I liked it.

462
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,360
Everything that you did.

463
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,560
Your performance wasn't bad.
It was great, really great.

464
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,600
And I didn't do it with you
because I wanted a company.

465
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,160
But because it was you.

466
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,440
But...

467
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,920
I don't know how the damn rumor spread.

468
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,480
But I have no problem with you.

469
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,640
I'm just...

470
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,760
Just...

471
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,680
I'm afraid you'll think I'm easy.

472
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,640
And obsessed with sex.

473
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,440
But I really like you.

474
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,640
I like you too.

475
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,080
So are we cool now?

476
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah.

477
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,160
A slut like you got a boyfriend?

478
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,880
After you've ruined my life...

479
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,480
...I won't let you be happy.

480
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,880
Here.

481
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,360
- What's this?
- Housewarming gift for you and Leo.

482
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,280
Hey! Don't open here.
You'll spoil the surprise.

483
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,960
Open when you're with Leo.

484
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,400
Oh, and you've gotta use it.
It was really hard to get.

485
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,040
- Trust me, it's good stuff.
- Yeah, real good.

486
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,560
- What's with you guys?
- They'll surely use it.

487
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,600
Don't, you'll break it.

488
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,760
Fine.

489
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,480
Let me see.
What's your prank this time?

490
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,880
I'm not scared.

491
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,200
Shit!

492
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,640
Perverts!

493
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Who's gonna use this?
I already have one.

494
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,960
What's wrong with you guys?

495
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,920
Fine, I won't waste your effort.

496
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,720
Let's give it a try.

497
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,080
Damn.

498
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,680
Oh, shit.

499
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,800
Mine isn't good enough for him?

500
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,440
Umm...

501
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,960
Umm...

502
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,960
Well...

503
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,040
Well...

504
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,520
- How about turn it off first?
- Yeah, good idea.

505
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,320
I don't know how.
