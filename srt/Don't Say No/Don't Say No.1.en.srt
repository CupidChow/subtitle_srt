00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,080
You go first.

166
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
You first.

167
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,920
Leo, just speak first.

168
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,280
It's nothing, I just want to tell you...

169
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,720
Have a safe walk home.

170
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
That's it?

171
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,400
Jeez, you drove me
to the front of my house.

172
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,480
I bet some thief can't wait to rob me here.

173
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,520
And don't you...

174
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,360
...have something to tell me?

175
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,240
Well, since you've nothing
to tell me, neither do I.

176
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,840
I just wanna say,
have a safe trip home.

177
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,600
That's it?

178
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Well, I'd better go in.
Drive safely.

179
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,920
Darn it.

180
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,840
Why is it so hard to ask
my boyfriend for a kiss?

181
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,840
Fiat.

182
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,080
Why is it so hard
to ask him for a hug?

183
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,760
When you were friends with him,
you could even jump on to his bed.

184
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,400
When the 'boyfriend' word is involved...

185
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,080
Why is it so difficult?

186
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,280
Fiat.

187
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,560
Man up.

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,240
Gimme a sec.

194
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,320

What did you say?

196
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,720
Wake up.

197
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,320
Not that.

198
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,280
You said, 'Wake up, love'?

199
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,560
Yeah, I said that.

200
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,040
Wake up, Fiat, my love.

201
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,680
You don't like it?

202
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,640
Oh.

203
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,120
No.

204
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,320
I'm just not used to it.

205
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,560
You've never done
anything like this before.

206
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,440
Then I'll do it more.

207
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,200
Okay, love?

208
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,960
Umm.

209
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,440
I think I'd better go wash up.

210
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,200
Gotta go.

211
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm not used to it too.

212
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,440
We've been friends for 20 years.

213
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,120
So how would I know
the way to treat him as a boyfriend?

214
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, Leo.

215
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,440
How...

216
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,760
How did you enter my room?

217
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,520
Umm...

218
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,720
I told your family that
I'm here to pick you up.

219
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,080
So they let me in.

220
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,840
Oh.

221
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Okay.

222
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,920
I guess it's one of the good things
going from best friends to lovers.

223
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,600
What's wrong with you?

224
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,360
I'm tired, guys.

225
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,560
Here, want some?

226
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,920
Wait, wait, wait.

227
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,200
You're taking a snack from someone
who didn't wash his hands after the toilet?

228
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,600
Ewww!

229
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,080
- The hell is wrong with you?
- Your reaction's too extreme.

230
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,280
I washed them, though.

231
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,080
You only wiped them on the shirt.

232
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,360
Fine, I didn't wash my hands.

233
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,760
Damn.

234
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,520
For God's sake, that's why I said
your brother's a gentleman.

235
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,520
- As for you...
- A scum?

236
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,480
So filthy.

237
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,720
So what's wrong with you?

238
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,360
Well...

239
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,400
Here's the thing.

240
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,320
Leo, I forgot to bring the clothes.

241
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
I've prepared them for you.

242
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,360
But I don't know...

243
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
...what type of underwear
you'll be wearing.

244
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,640
Hey.

245
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,480
Ummm...

246
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,120
Or this one?

247
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,360
Or this one?

248
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,880
I've just realized that you own...

249
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,760
...many types.

250
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,960
Shit!

251
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,000
Damn, you really own a g-string?

252
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,920
Man, I bet Leo's gonna love it
if you wear it for him.

253
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,240
Are you wearing one?

254
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,360
You guys!
You think it's so funny?

255
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,960
Your friend's dying of embarrassment here.

256
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,120
Come on, why so shy?

257
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,120
You're gonna wear it
for him one day anyway.

258
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,120
Will you guys just keep listening?

259
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,240
- Sure, I wanna know.
- Go on.

260
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,880
Okay, here's the thing.

261
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,360
The thing is...

262
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,400
What are you doing?

263
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,600
Preparing breakfast.

264
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,240
I know you don't like eating breakfast.

265
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,840
But take a bite.
To boost your energy.

266
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,440
You call this a bite?

267
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,520
Well, it might not look appetizing,
but I tasted it.

268
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
It's edible.

269
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,640
Don't tell me you made it yourself?

270
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Yeah.

271
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,040
I made it for you.

272
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Oh?

273
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,520
What's with your reaction?

274
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,680
Nam, do you know why people sell kidneys?

275
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,120
You already told that joke.

276
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,160
Because my heart feels more worthless
after hearing him brag about his boyfriend.

277
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,240
Hey, I'm not bragging.
I'm so tired right now.

278
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,240
Seriously, what are you tired from?

279
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,400
- You've got someone to wake you up.
- Yeah.

280
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,080
- Prepare your clothes after shower.
- Right.

281
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,440
- And deliver food to your mouth.
- Correct.

282
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,760
So how come you're tired?

283
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,120
Well, it's my heart.

284
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,159
I'm not lying, my heart's really tired.

285
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,520
It's about to explode.

286
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
I've liked Leo for a long time.

287
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,719
But when we finally got together,
I almost couldn't take it.

288
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,159
And now that he's treating me like this.

289
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,920
Do you really think
my heart could handle it?

290
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
- What are you on about?
- Jeez.

291
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,199
That's rich coming from someone
who slept around nonstop to spite Leo.

292
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Dammit, you didn't wash your hands.

293
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,239
I'm sorry, slip of the tongue.

294
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,400
Come on, it's already in the past.

295
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Besides, you're not like that
anymore, right?

296
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,160
- You're right.
- Yeah.

297
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:14,400
Seriously, you've been with so many guys.
Is Leo really gonna be your last one?

298
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,760
I can do it.

299
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,920
Though I've been with many guys,
Leo's the only one I've ever liked.

300
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,800
- Oh Anda, what brought you here?
- And who's the bouquet for?

301
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Wow, a political science beauty.
How may I be of service?

302
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,560
Leo got this for you.

303
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:51,200
- Oh, wow.
- So sick of it, so sick.

304
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,480
See you later.

305
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,320
I thought you were tired.

306
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,080
I bet he won't come to class tomorrow.

307
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,040
Yeah, they'll probably do it
10 times tonight. So annoying.

308
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,840
You guys!

309
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,120
- What? How many roses are there?
- What a boyfriend bragger.

310
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
What's up?

311
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,720
My younger brother said you sent
flowers to Fiat at the arts building.

312
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Leo asked me to pick them up,
so I made the delivery too.

313
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,200
Oh, and he called me last night
to ask for a recipe.

314
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,600
He's seriously in love.

315
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,200
In love or inexperienced?

316
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,760

you wanted to be a life coach.

321
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,560
You think these books really help?

322
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,120
It's better than nothing.

323
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,760
What a noob.

324
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
You're acting like Fiat's your first lover.

325
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,960
Yeah.

326
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,720
First love. First boyfriend. First time.

327
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,680
Leo.

328
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,000
I know you don't talk much about yourself.

329
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,560
But with your looks,
pedigree, and social status.

330
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,640
You had always been a virgin?

331
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,960
I can't separate love and sex.

332
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,800
But Fiat can.

333
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,160
You're being insecure, Leo.

334
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,560
Hold on.

335
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,520
This is the reason you've been
acting strange all day long?

336
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,800
My twin said Fiat looked troubled
because you were acting strange.

337
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,440
He didn't like it?

338
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,600
Like An said.

339
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,360
Are you feeling insecure?

340
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,240
You're probably thinking Fiat won't
commit to you if you don't do this.

341
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,000
Or you're suck in bed?

342
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,320
Anda.

343
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,920
So do these books tell you?

344
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,840
That instead of acting like an ideal guy...

345
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,800
...you should find time to talk
and meet him halfway.

346
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,560
Love is not assumption.

347
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,680
Mr. Fiat, when did you come?
I didn't hear the garage door opening.

348
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,960
I entered from the side gate.

349
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,280
Oh.

350
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,960
And Mr. Leo didn't come with you?

351
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,040
My class is canceled today.

352
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,040
Then I'm going to Leo's room.

353
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,240
Auntie, what's Mr. Fiat's
relationship with Mr. Leo?

354
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,440
He always comes here.

355
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Sometimes, he didn't
return home for a week.

356
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,040
It's the boss' business.
Don't be a busybody.

357
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,200
Come on, Auntie. I'm just curious.

358
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,960
- Take it away. He's gone upstairs.
- Really?

359
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,440
So nosy.

360
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,120
When's your class over?
I'll pick you up.

361
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I'm home now.

362
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:07,240
Yours or mine?

363
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,240
Yours.

364
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,120
Then I'll hurry back.

365
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,520
So why did you run away from Leo?

366
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,920
Because I was embarrassed.

367
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,000
We've been friends since we were young.

368
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,320
And I'd had a crush on him for years.

369
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,960
Yeah, I'm promicuous.
But he's the only one I like.

370
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,880
So can't I feel embarrassed?

371
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,280
I wanna act shameless like I want to.

372
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,600
But I don't have the courage.

373
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,120
What if Leo hates it?
What if he thinks I'm flirty?

374
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,840
Leo's scent.

375
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,320
Fiat.

376
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,000
Fiat.

377
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,680
Fiat.

378
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,920
Fiat.

379
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,840
You're back, Mr. Leo?

380
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,920
Yes. Where's Fiat?

381
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,640
In your room.

382
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,960
Mr. Leo, when will you have your dinner?

383
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,840
-Let me ask him first.
- Okay.

384
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,400
- Oh, what about desserts?
- I'll tell you later.

385
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,360
Hey!

386
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,000
Shit.

387
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,360
What were you doing?

388
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,760
I'm going home.

389
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,280
- Fiat.
- Hey!

390
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,400
Why are you following me?

391
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,800
Hey, let me go!

392
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,480
No, I won't.

393
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,080
What were you doing?

394
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,960
Nothing.

395
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Fiat.

396
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,720
I'm a guy too.

397
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,080
Why?

398
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,600
Can't I get turned on by my boyfriend?

399
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,160
You can.

400
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,600
But you made a mistake.

401
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,560
What did I do?

402
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,760
You didn't tell me.

403
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,600
This kind of thing.

404
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,800
You just have to tell me.

405
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,400
Holy guacamole.

406
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,640
Madam, I must inform Madam.

407
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,880
We're screwed!
