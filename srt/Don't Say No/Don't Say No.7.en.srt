1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,400
You had no one to complain to
while I wasn't around, right?

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,960
Yes.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,320
I really missed you.
Did you cry a lot while I wasn't around?

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,400
That's good, you've grown.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,400
So when did you come back?
What about Dad?

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,600
I flew back right away after
I finished my work in Paris.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,160
I've just landed a few hours ago.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,560
And left Dad all by
himself in Switzerland.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,880
You still haven't learned your lesson.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,760
Really, Leon.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,640
There's nobody as sweet as Fiat.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,600
You're always obedient to me.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,560
Mommy, I missed you so much.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,480
And do you know Leon always
bullied me while you weren't around?

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,720
Oh, hey!

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,640
Oh?

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
Hey, wanna get pinched again?

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
Why?

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,160
Didn't you say you'd obey your
brother after you returned to Thailand?

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,160
But besides ignoring my calls,
you also bullied his boyfriend?

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,960
You're unbelievable.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,240
What? Missed me, didn't you?

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
Yes.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,039
Well, since you've missed me.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,920
How about a late-night talk
to make up for lost time?

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,120
Hmm?

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,039
I've so much to talk about.

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Come on, Mom.
What about me?

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
What about you?

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,920
You're a grown man.
Go sleep with your brother.

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sleeping in Fiat's room tonight, right?

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,560
Yes.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
I haven't eaten since I arrived.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,000
So hungry.

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,320
Do you have any food in the kitchen?

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,720
I'd better find something to eat.

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,640
I can smell a pleasant aroma
coming from the kitchen.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,600
I wonder what you were cooking.

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,720
This is Mom's.

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,079
Can't I eat it?

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,800
The queen bee's arrived.
We're all doomed.

42
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,720
EP.7: The top of the food chain

43
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
How have you been?

44
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,240
We hadn't seen each other
for over a year, right?

45
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,240
Give me an update on your life.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,840
There's nothing much to tell.
My life's uneventful.

47
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,680
Then let me ask you a question.

48
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,960
Where's the ruggedly handsome guy?

49
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,640
Hmm?

50
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,480
The one you posted
his picture on your IG.

51
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,360
He's totally my type.

52
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
Mom.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,400
The truth is...

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm dating Leo!

55
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
Why are you apologizing?

57
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,240
I should be asking if you're
okay with my coward son.

58
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,000
That boy's gotten so big.

59
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,040
I even gave him a lion
name, but look at him.

60
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,240
He's as coward as a tiny mouse.

61
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,400
So you're not gonna scold me?

62
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,160
That's why I want to know
why you apologized to me.

63
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,920
Why would I scold you, son?

64
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,600
Well.

65
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,400
You know I had many relationships.

66
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,240
And slept with many people.

67
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Since you know this, will you
really let me date your son?

68
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,520
Fiat.

69
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,680
Didn't I tell you that
you were like a son to me?

70
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
And you weren't even
dating Leo back then.

71
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,280
It was him who was tongue-tied.

72
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,520
If there's anything I worry about...

73
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,160
...it's Leo's capability to satisfy you.

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Mom!

75
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
What are you saying?

76
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,640
- What?
- Mom!

77
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
You're blushing!

78
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,440
Don't worry and don't think too much.

79
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,600
I don't mind at all.

80
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Do you know?

81
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,240
Before I met Leo's Dad...

82
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,880
...I was talking to many people too.

83
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,080
Wow!

84
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,640
Hmm?

85
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,200
Seeing all of you happy,
It's worth coming back this time.

86
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
I love you the most.

87
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,520
I love you too.

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Love you so much!

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why do we have to sleep
in the same bed, P' Leo?

90
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,720
Then why don't you go home?

91
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,360
You know our mom.
If I disobey her, I'm screwed.

92
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,679
She might drag me back abroad.

93
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,400
Or have Dad cut back on my allowance.

94
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,600
She's ordered me to sleep
here, so I have to do it.

95
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,720
I don't dare disobey her.

96
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,720
I love you, Big Brother.

97
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,440
But sleeping in the same
bed with you? I really can't.

98
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Will Mom scold Fiat?

99
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,600
What will she scold him for?
Don't you know what she's like?

100
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,040
She's seen right through
you guys since we were young.

101
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She knows what you're like.

102
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,680
What I'm like.

103
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,560
And What P' Fiat's like.

104
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,440
She knows P' Fiat likes men.

105
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,680
She even knows you like P' Fiat.

106
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,560
I bet she knew you guys liked each other
before you even realized your feelings.

107
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
She was just waiting.

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,280
You're right.

109
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
Maybe she's known all along.

110
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,800
How am I gonna sleep tonight?

111
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,040
If you were P' Pob,
I'd squeeze you to death.

112
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,000
Just try to sleep.
It'll be morning soon.

113
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,600
Can I pick Jer up with you tomorrow?

114
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,120
Sure, see you at 10.

115
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,880
P' Leo, look at this!
P' Pob replied to my message.

116
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,520
Take a look!

117
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,560
Why aren't you happy for me?

118
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Okay. Good night, P' Pob.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,160
Where's Mom?

120
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,880
Sleeping.

121
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,440
I couldn't sleep, so I
came down to get a drink.

122
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,120
What about you?

123
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,640
Warn me.

124
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,920
If Mom tells me to sleep in
the same room with Leon again.

125
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
So what did she say to you?

126
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,320
You're lucky you've got a mother.

127
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,280
Then you're luckier.

128
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,600
Since you have both Mom and me.

129
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,840
Will Mom scold me if
I sleep downstairs tonight?

130
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
I'll take the blame if she does.

131
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
What's this?

132
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,840
A gift to celebrate
our friendiversary.

133
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,440
For real?

134
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,880
Mom bought it for us.

135
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,720
I haven't opened it.
I want to open it with you.

136
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,960
She remembers?

137
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,760
You know how she is.
She never forgets anything.

138
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,760
Take it out.

139
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
Wow, it's pretty.

140
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,320
- Yeah.
- She's chosen such perfect gifts.

141
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,600
It's your name, Leo.

142
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
And that's my name.

143
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
Here.

144
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
I'll wear this one.

145
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
As for this one.

146
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
It's yours.

147
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
Does it mean I'm yours?

148
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,360
What I'm trying to say is
I'll be with you wherever you go.

149
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,040
Pretty cute, isn't it?

150
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
Yeah.

151
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,320
Let me carry it.

152
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,560
It's okay, P' Pob. I can do it.

153
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,240
I feel bad.

154
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,880
You went to pick up Pobjer with me
and drove me back to my place.

155
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,160
If you feel bad, then can I
walk you back to your room?

156
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,800
As you wish.

157
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,440
You agreed to my wish again.

158
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,280
If you keep doing it,
I may turn into a spoiled kid.

159
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
You're already one.

160
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,120
- Let me.
- Here.

161
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,360
We're home.

162
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
Come on.

163
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,040
So what's her illness?

164
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,840
Immunodeficiency.

165
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,760
The vet's scheduled another
checkup in two months.

166
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,839
We can only observe her condition now.

167
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,400
You seem like a cat lover.

168
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,000
Take this!

169
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,240
Your kiss is stolen.

170
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,360
What are you playing at?

171
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm not playing, I'm serious.

172
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
The kitty's stolen your kiss again.

173
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,000
Here too. And here, and here.

174
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,080
- Leon.
- Here, and here, and here.

175
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,680
- Leon.
- Here too. And here, and here.

176
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,160
- Leon.
- Here, and here, and here.

177
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,320
Here too. And here.

178
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,280
This is what you call stealing a kiss.

179
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,520
Happy now?

180
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,520
If you're happy, I'll stop playing.

181
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,880
Oh!

182
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,760
Oh?

183
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,240
What's with the sudden good mood?

184
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,680
Your son's happy.
That's why he's in a good mood.

185
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,080
Oh, hey!

186
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,960
Stealing a kiss from
you is refreshing.

187
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,320
But doing that is more refreshing.

188
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,600
Bye.

189
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,240
Mrs. Nadia, how are
Mr. Leo and Mr. Fiat?

190
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,080
They're doing fine.
Better than I thought.

191
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,320
I'm sorry, I was too
excited back then.

192
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,920
I've been supporting them
since they were young.

193
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,680
So I made a blunder when
I saw it with my own eyes.

194
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,160
Mr. Leo must have known
that I spied on him for you.

195
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,880
Otherwise he wouldn't have moved out.

196
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,280
You don't have to worry
about those two at all, P' Jah.

197
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,800
But do you know if Leon's been
talking with anyone in particular lately?

198
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,360
I'm not sure, but he's
been behaving a lot better.

199
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,640
He comes home early, stops partying,
and doesn't bring anyone home at all.

200
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,560
But lately, he's been rambling on
about P' Pob something.

201
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,000
P' Pob?

202
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,600
So what are you going to do next?

203
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,440
I already have plans
for Leo and Fiat.

204
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,640
Just wondering if it's
time to carry them out.

205
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
But Leon's another story.

206
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,200
I understand the orphanage's situation.

207
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,480
Coming back this time,
I'll discuss with the foundation.

208
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,160
Better get it done fast,
or people will find out I've returned.

209
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I know, you'll be invited to
many charity events if they do.

210
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
Leo, you must remember this.

211
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,480
If our family decides to help someone,
it's because they need our help.

212
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
We help them because
we want to do it.

213
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,000
We want neither to
show off nor to gain fame.

214
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,400
Changing your mindset can bring
you different types of happiness.

215
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,520
Yes, I'll remember it.

216
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,320
But you could've just
called me about this matter.

217
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,640
Why did you tell me to come home?

218
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,360
Do you have anything to ask me?

219
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,400
Smart.

220
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,360
Do you know Leon's P' Pob?

221
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,440
Yes.

222
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,920
Tell me.

223
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,760
A senior who asked for
my help that I told you about.

224
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,120
That's P' Pobphan.

225
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,880
Oh, so that's Pobphan.

226
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,240
And...

227
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,880
What's he like?

228
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,800
I don't think I should
judge P' Pob's personality.

229
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,080
You should see for yourself.

230
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,880
Fine.

231
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,040
Then, before I make a decision
about the orphanage...

232
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,080
...I should talk to the person
in charge of this matter.

233
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,440
Okay.

234
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,280
So, 10 a.m. tomorrow at your house.

235
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,760
Make an appointment for me.

236
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,800
Okay.

237
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, almost forgot.

238
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
Leon's going to sleep
at your house tonight.

239
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,720
- I'm going shopping now.
- Okay.

240
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,040
See you.

241
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,840
- Hello, P' Pob.
- Hello.

242
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,000
Please come in.

243
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,080
Let's go.

244
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,880
Did you get lost?

245
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,320
No, I followed the map you sent me.

246
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,200
Is this...

247
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
...your house?

248
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,600
Yes, but it's not
the one we grew up in.

249
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,560
I've moved here with Fiat
because it's closer to the campus.

250
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,560
Are you ready to talk to the person
who decides on the donation budget?

251
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,400
I have to be.
For the children's well-being.

252
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Come on.

253
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,520
I've learned about
the orphanage's situation.

254
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,800
From what you and Leo told me.

255
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll help you this time.

256
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,800
But on one condition.

257
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,880
Okay, I'll do everything I can.

258
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,880
You can do it.
It's not difficult.

259
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,920
Lately you've become
close to my son, Leon, right?

260
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,920
Yes.

261
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,520
I want you to persuade
Leon to go back with me.

262
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,560
I don't know if Leon's told you anything.

263
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,000
But my job requires a lot of travel.

264
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,440
And those brothers' father is
an embassador to Switzerland.

265
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,720
So I only have Leon
with me when I travel.

266
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,880
It'll be hard for me if
Leon moves back to Thailand.

267
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,000
But I'm not telling you to force him.

268
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,880
Just help me talk to him.

269
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
It's not too hard, right?

270
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,480
I'm sorry, Auntie.

271
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,320
Oh, why?
It's not a difficult task at all.

272
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,680
Yes, it's not.

273
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,040
But I can't do it.

274
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,120
I believe Leon has his reasons
for coming back to Thailand.

275
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,640
He has things he wants to do.

276
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,320
Like him, I have things
to accomplish as well.

277
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
If I put myself in his shoes.

278
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,560
I'd be unhappy if I was forced
to do or not to do something.

279
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,880
I really can't help you with this matter.

280
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,800
Even though it affects the matter
you ask me to help you with?

281
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,240
Yes.

282
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,720
I'm sorry that I can't do it.
I don't want to force anyone.

283
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,960
But I still want to ask for your help.

284
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,040
Can I do something else instead?

285
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,640
I'll go to the orphanage tomorrow.

286
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,160
To inform them that...

287
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,480
...the Thutanukul family will
double the donation this year.

288
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,600
Thank you on the children's behalf.

289
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,120
Don't, you're the one who help them.

290
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,400
P' Leo.

291
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,240
Mom's here?

292
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,480
So you told me to sleep here...

293
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,480
Shit!

294
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,880
Why today of all days?
And with this pair too!

295
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,280
Dammit!

296
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,240
Serves you right!

297
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,480
This will stop you from flaunting your
worn-out underwear around the house.

298
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
That's Leon for you.

299
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,040
Why didn't anyone tell me
that P' Pob would drop by?

300
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,320
If he was gonna see me naked...

301
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,720
...couldn't it at least have been
when I wear newer underwear?

302
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,240
And there are holes in that pair too.

303
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,360
The image I've been nurturing
is gone with the wind!

304
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,440
What's so embarrassing
about the underwear?

305
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,160
Shouldn't you be more
embarrassed about yourself?

306
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,480
Why would I be
embarrassed by my fit body?

307
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Woah!

308
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,880
But the underwear
incident is another story.

309
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,040
I'd always been imagining
that at least when it happened...

310
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,760
...P' Pob would see my
handsomeness from head to toes.

311
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,640
Not...

312
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,720
Though the package is good,
if the wrapper is bad...

313
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,120
...everything will be ruined!

314
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,200
I suggest you change your underwears.

315
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,200
Mom!

316
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,640
Tackle the problem at the root.

317
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,720
Oh right, Leo. You told me
that I needed to see Pob for myself.

318
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,800
When I met him today, I didn't
think he'd refuse my request.

319
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,520
I thought he'd try
to negotiate with me.

320
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,000
However, this boy
unexpectedly surprised me.

321
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:13,960
He seems naive and docile,
but he has a mind of his own.

322
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,240
He's genuine.

323
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,120
So why did you ask P' Pob to come?

324
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,240
And why didn't tell him to wait?
I could've given him a ride.

325
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,400
It's my business why I called him here.

326
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,920
I wanted to get to know him.

327
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,080
Leon.

328
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,600
I want him.

329
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,480
Huh?

330
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,400
I don't care how you do it
or how you talk him into it.

331
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,400
But I want this boy to be my son.

332
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,160
Okay, I'd better leave.

333
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,840
Remember my words.
I want him.

334
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,720
Yes.

335
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,400
You must help him.

336
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,080
Mom wants P' Pob.

337
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,440
- Bleurgh!
- What?

338
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,280
Just keep eating.

339
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,320
- Wanna eat?
- Gimme some.

340
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,640
Not asleep yet?

341
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,600
It's only eight.

342
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,160
You're right, it's only eight.

343
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,320
- What time do you usually go to bed?
- Butt out.

344
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,800
Mommy, P' Fiat's home.
Don't know why he's back.

345
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,600
Hello?

346
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,560
Mom.

347
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,560
Is everything okay?
You sound strange.

348
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,159
I wish my family is like yours.

349
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,080
Did you fight with your dad again?

350
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,840
- Not Dad.
- Then it's your sister.

351
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,320
You're so smart.

352
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,800
It's either you fought with Mait
or Fa said something to you.

353
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,040
These are the only reasons
that make you feel down.

354
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,040
I might have fought
with my stepmother.

355
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,720
I know that's not the case.

356
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,880
Fiat, you know who
Fa loves the most.

357
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,880
So, value the person she loves
and you will win her heart.

358
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,200
But I hate her mother.

359
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,080
Maybe it's time you opened up.

360
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,760
You're a grown man now.

361
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,200
The truth may be completely
different from what you think.

362
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,000
No, that's not the file I want.
Send me the other one.

363
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,520
Sure, I need it tomorrow.

364
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,720
Fiat.

365
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll call you back.

366
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,160
Are you hungry?
Would you like to eat something first?

367
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
I'm not hungry.

368
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,280
Are you ready, Fiat?

369
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,640
Hello, Auntie Fay.
I'm here to pick Fiat up.

370
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,200
Let's go, we're gonna be late.

371
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,560
The next time I sleep
at home, I'll eat breakfast.

372
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,760
Why are you smiling?

373
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,040
I'm proud of you today.

374
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
I haven't done anything.

375
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,600
You did good.

376
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
Mom forced me to do it.

377
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,720
I lost to my mom again?

378
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,640
But that's fine, I give in to her.

379
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,560
As long as she makes you happy.

380
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,320
Who says I'm happy?
I totally hate Fa's mom.

381
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,560
If you say so.

382
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,760
What?

383
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,640
I thought you were gonna say...

384
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,560
..."Though you hate Fa's mom,
I still love only you."

385
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,840
Like that!

386
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,920
Don't you know how
to say romantic things?

387
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,480
I'm going to class.

388
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,400
Come on, stop sulking.

389
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,160
Because you've been bullying
me, just like your brother.

390
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,280
Then what should I do to pacify you?

391
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,920
Figure it out yourself.

392
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,280
You think I'll stop sulking
just because of a peck?

393
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,240
That's enough.

394
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,840
I'm not angry anymore.

395
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,640
If you do more...

396
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,280
...you'll turn me on.

397
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Though you hate someone,
I still love only you.

398
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll pick you up in the evening.

399
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,840
Okay.

400
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,720
Well, well, well.

401
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,600
I saw you accompanied
by a certain someone.

402
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,880
You didn't give a damn about this
poor friend when you were kissing.

403
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,680
I have such a good boyfriend,
so I've gotta show him off.

404
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,240
Really? How good is he?
Please elaborate.

405
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,400
My boyfriend's good-looking and nice.

406
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,760
He's a fucking beast too!

407
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,520
I don't believe you.
Let me see the clip.

408
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,800
Nam! If I let you watch it,
you're gonna post it online.

409
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,920
Does this mean
there's actually a clip?

410
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,880
- Let me see it.
- What? I don't have any.

411
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,240
Even if I had one,
I wouldn't let you watch it.

412
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,240
Such wild and intense stuff
is obviously for my eyes only.

413
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,960
Stingy. Please let me see it.

414
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,440
Fuck, Nam! What's wrong with you?

415
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,840
- Let's go, we're gonna be late.
- Fine.

416
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,400
Dream on.

417
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,000
Leon?

418
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,600
Oh, P' Pob?
Why are you here?

419
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,200
Mom asked me to have dinner
with her. What about you?

420
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,760
Auntie said she wanted more
details about the orphanage.

421
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,240
I think we've been tricked.

422
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,640
Guess she's not coming.

423
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,320
She must've ordered many dishes for us.

424
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,600
Please eat before they get cold.

425
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,720
You sure it's a good idea?

426
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,560
I know my mom well.

427
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,520
I bet she must've read my mind.

428
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,480
Your mind?

429
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,800
What's on your mind?

430
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,960
It's the thought that I want
to get serious with you.

431
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,160
Please don't think too much.
That's how my mom is.

432
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,960
Always does what she wants.

433
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,480
She used to be much
worse when I was young.

434
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,680
My mom's a designer.

435
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,240
Work requires her to travel a lot,
but she's attached to family.

436
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,360
My dad has his own career too.

437
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,000
And P' Leo wanted to stay in Thailand.

438
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,320
So I had to follow my mom everywhere.

439
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,400
You may not believe me,
but I used to be a scaredy-cat.

440
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,560
I couldn't talk to strangers at all.

441
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,840
But you don't look timid.

442
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,400
Because my mom constantly moved
to different countries because of work.

443
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,680
So I often transferred schools.

444
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,240
If I didn't adapt,
I wouldn't have survived.

445
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,600
That's why I was looking forward
to coming back to Thailand.

446
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,000
My dream is to settle down.

447
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,360
Without moving around
or being away from home.

448
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,840
What about you?
How was your childhood?

449
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,320
I bet you were a very cute boy.

450
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,800
I don't remember much.

451
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
My mom left me at the orphanage.

452
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,680
P' Pob, it's okay if you
don't wanna talk about it.

453
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,320
It's fine.

454
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,920
I want to tell you.

455
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,280
Do you want to hear it?

456
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,200
I grew up in the orphanage.

457
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,880
I don't remember my mom's face.

458
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,240
Don't know who my parents are.

459
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,560
But I almost got adopted once.

460
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,680
The couple didn't have children.

461
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,080
But they suddenly canceled
the adoption request.

462
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,440
Because the wife got pregnent.

463
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,480
I guess their baby didn't
want me in their family.

464
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,200
Then I met my adoptive father.

465
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,400
He adopted me.

466
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,520
He named me 'Pobphan'.

467
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,480
He told me not to be sad.

468
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,000
Every life is meaningful.

469
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,200
He wished that I would meet
someone important to me some day.

470
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,760
Just like how he met me.

471
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,080
Pobphan.

472
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,320
It means the encounter
between my dad and me.

473
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,240
Thank you for telling me, P' Pob.

474
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,560
P' Pob, let's go home.

475
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,160
Thank you for listening to my story.

476
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,240
I'm the one who should
thank you for telling me.

477
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,680
Don't know why I told you about it.

478
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,080
But I want you to
know about my father.

479
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,760
If he were alive...

480
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,760
...he would really like you.

481
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,920
P' Pob.

482
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,760
Push me if you hate it.

483
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,920
Why didn't you reject me?

484
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,640
You told me to push you if I hated it.

485
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,480
But I don't think I hate it.

486
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,520
Why's my heart so weak for you?

487
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,400
Your birthday's coming up.

488
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,680
Yeah, I'll catch up with you soon.

489
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,200
But I'll be ahead of you
in a few more months.

490
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,640
What do you want for your birthday?

491
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,600
Well...

492
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,280
Shouldn't you come up with it yourself?

493
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,360
I want to give you something
that you really want.

494
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,480
I actually want nothing.

495
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,840
'Cause I've already got it.

496
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,640
You.

497
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,360
Apart from me, don't
you want anything else?

498
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,760
I guess I wanna see my mom.

499
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,080
But I don't think it's possible.

500
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,520
Thanks for walking me back.

501
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,320
My pleasure.
You should go up now.

502
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,240
Wait.

503
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,240
Umm...

504
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,400
Enough.

505
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,920
Let's call it a day.

506
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,680
Good night.

507
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,720
Good night!
