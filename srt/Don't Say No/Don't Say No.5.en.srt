1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,600
Are you out of your mind, Fiat?

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
How can your 4-year experience
be compared to this one toy?

3
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,960
Why don't you dry your hair?

4
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,080
It'll dry on its own.
I'm not gonna sleep yet.

5
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,080
Come here.

6
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,479
Oh, do you know a guy named Pobphan
from Faculty of Social Work?

7
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,520
- You mean P' Pob?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,640
I do.

9
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,720
You're close to him?

10
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,640
No, P' Pob is...

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,759
He's a friend of my senior.

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
Come dry your hair.

13
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,800
EP.5: The lousy plan of sis-in-law
and boyfriend's lil bro

14
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,720
EP.5: The lousy plan of sis-in-law
and boyfriend's lil bro
Nam, did you know
you've got a secret admirer?

15
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
Nam, did you know
you've got a secret admirer?

16
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,440
How would I know since it's a secret?

17
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,440
Man, you're no fun at all.

18
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,920
- Fiat.
- Guys.

19
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,920
Do you know a guy named Pobphan
from Faculty of Social Work?

20
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,520
No.

21
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,159
Is that a food? Is it delicious?

22
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,159
Food my ass!
It's obviously a person's name.

23
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,120
Nam, you're close to
student council members, right?

24
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,200
Do you know this Pobphan guy?

25
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,240
No, I don't know him. Who's he?
Is he the same as you?

26
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
- Is he fun to tease?
- Hey!

27
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,440
Lately I've been feeling
teasing you isn't fun anymore.

28
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,080
I wanna find a new target.

29
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,840
Both of you are fucking useless.

30
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

31
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
- I'm gonna tell my dad.
- Yeah.

32
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,120
You little shit.

33
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,760
- You really are.
- I'mma beat you.

34
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
Let's do it.

35
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,760
Okay class, let's continue
from where we left off.

36
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,080
What do you want?

37
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,480
Let's talk after you finish
your report, I can wait.

38
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
- But after this report, I'll have to...
- I can read while waiting.

39
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,560
Suit yourself.

40
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Leon.

41
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,400
Leon.

42
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Leon!

43
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,680
I wasn't sleeping.
Just resting my eyes.

44
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,400
Yeah, resting your eyes.
And snoring.

45
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,080
I was snoring?

46
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,320
No.

47
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,440
It's because I'm not used to
Thai books with difficult words.

48
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,760
And now you've seen me
in my unattractive moment.

49
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,040
So what do you want?

50
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,800
I've got a gift.

51
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,040
Here, a cat collar.

52
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,360
Carved with Pobjer's name.
There's a bell too.

53
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
Isn't it cute?

54
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
I can't accept it.

55
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,840
I knew you'd say this.

56
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,800
Who says I'm giving it to you?

57
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,320
It's for Pobjer.

58
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,800
A thank you gift for, ummm...
the ice and the umbrella.

59
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,240
But it's for Pobjer,
not P' Pobphan.

60
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,440
Beautiful?

61
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,560
Wanna give it to her yourself?

62
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,280
What!

63
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,520
Keep your voice down.

64
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,640
What do you mean?

65
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,360
- Give it to Pobjer yourself.
- Oh.

66
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,760
- Please excuse the mess.
- Yes.

67
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
I'll go look for Pobjer.

68
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,880
Since he's bringing me to his room.

69
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,040
Oh, you can sit on the bed.

70
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,360
And letting me sit on the bed.

71
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,840
It means only one thing.

72
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Here you are, found you!

73
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,800
This is Pobjer.

74
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,840
What was that?

75
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,320
Nothing, it was just a mosquito.

76
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,320
Nong Pobjer, P' Leon's got
a gift for you.

77
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,720
C'mere.

78
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,680
My sense of style is so good.

79
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,360
She's so soft.

80
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
And warm too.

81
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,880
You've never touched a cat before?

82
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
I guess I did when I was young.

83
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,280
There was a time when
I wanted to raise a cat.

84
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,600
But my mom's allergic
to cats, and so is P' Fiat.

85
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,920
So my dad and P' Leo totally
forbid me from raising one.

86
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,040
I remember I once said to my dad.

87
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,280
"If you don't want me to
raise a cat, then buy me a lion."

88
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,440
So the next morning, Dad and P' Leo
bought me lots of Simba plushies.

89
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,600
Your family's kind.

90
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,760
Especially P' Leo.

91
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
When he indulges someone,
he spoils them rotten.

92
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,960
That's why I'm a spoiled kid.

93
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,200
Leo is kind?

94
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,960
P' Pob, P' Leo's got a boyfriend.

95
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
I know.

96
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,640
There's no one in the campus who
hasn't seen the love confession clip.

97
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Oh, are you thirsty?
I'll get you a drink.

98
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
Leo.

99
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,800
Can I talk to you for a second?

100
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
Sure, do you need something, P' Pob?

101
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,520
You know me?

102
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
Use it.

103
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,120
Don't use it.

104
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,920
Use it.

105
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
Jeez, what am I doing?

106
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,200
But Leo seems to be satisfied,
so why do I gotta use it?

107
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,640
P' Fiat, there you are.

108
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,480
What's this?

109
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,040
Don't tell me you're guessing
if P' Leo loves you or not.

110
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,520
What an idiot.

111
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,400
Piss off.

112
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,880
What the hell are you doing?

113
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
Why are you leaving P' Leo with P' Pob?

114
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,600
Huh, what did you say?

115
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,720
Can you not be deaf now?

116
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,200
My friend saw P' Leo with P' Pob.

117
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,560
I thought you could handle it.
Turns out you're all talk.

118
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,880
Hey, I'm older than you.

119
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,680
And what have you been
doing all this time?

120
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,760
You said you could handle your P' Pob.

121
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,840
I've just started to pursue him.
How can I meddle with his life?

122
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,280
But trust my skills, he'll
be my boyfriend in no time.

123
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
In the meantime, keep P' Leo
away, so I can score points.

124
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,000
What? How about you
keep your damn P' Pob away?

125
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,760
How rude, don't call him
that, you damn Fiat.

126
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
How very polite of you.

127
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
You're fucking useless.

128
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,240
Fine, I know what to do.

129
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,440
Fiat, I'm ordering pizza.
Do you want...

130
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,760
...anything?

131
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,520
That's my hoodie.

132
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,400
Yeah.

133
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
So...

134
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,440
I'm dressing like this, do you...

135
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,040
...like it?

136
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, I found this.

137
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,920
Wanna use this housewarming gift?

138
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,760
You're seducing me?

139
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm not.

140
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm going to punish you.

141
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,880
Do it.

142
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,280
This thing?

143
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,320
Leo, it tickles.

144
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,280
How about this?

145
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
Leo!

146
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,600
I told you I'm going to punish you.

147
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,960
This is the punishment.

148
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,840
Please, Leo.

149
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,080
What do you want me to do?

150
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,080
Kiss me.

151
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,360
Your reward.

152
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Fiat?

153
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,800
What are you doing?

154
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,560
I'm embarrassed.

155
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
Then why did you seduce me?

156
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,560
I didn't seduce you.
Who seduced you?

157
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,960
So what are you watching?

158
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,320
Ice skating TV show.

159
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,080
You used to like it.

160
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,880
If you didn't turn to basketball like me,
you would've been a pro ice skater.

161
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,520
I'll only embarrass myself if I do it now.

162
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,560
I bet I'll tumble all over the place.

163
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,360
Don't you remember when
your mom took us to ice skating?

164
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,920
That should show you enough.

165
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,800
But I remember you liked it.

166
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,160
How about this?

167
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,400
Should I rent out
the whole ice rink for you?

168
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,560
To save you the embarrassment.

169
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,440
You can't actually do it.

170
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,560
Stop it.

171
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,040
You don't need to seduce me.

172
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm already head over heels for you.

173
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,720
What do you mean?
I didn't seduce you.

174
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,920
So you'll fly back next month.

175
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,240
Yes, my wife really missses the children.

176
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,840
Oh, and thank you for taking care
of Leo while we're staying here, Mait.

177
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,680
Don't, I didn't do anything.

178
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,200
Your family's the one
who's been helping me.

179
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,400
Without you, Fiat and I wouldn't
have talked to each other.

180
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Besides, I impose the burden
of taking care of Fiat on Leo.

181
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,480
I believe Leo's willing
to carry out this duty.

182
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,480
My wife and I consider Fiat our son.

183
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,520
While I can't even have
a proper conversation with him.

184
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
Mait.

185
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,920
I don't want to say this.

186
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,960
But we're not getting any younger.
We don't know when we'll die.

187
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,920
Do you want your relationship
with him to be like this forever?

188
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
Think about it, Mait.

189
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,680
Fiat may be stubborn.

190
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,720
But not too stubborn
that he won't yield at all.

191
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,160
Only to you guys.

192
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,000
All I can say is this matter's up to you.

193
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,600
Your iced Americano.

194
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
Thank you.

195
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,080
Eww, so bitter.

196
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,160
How could you drink it?

197
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,360
P' Fiat, how the hell
could you still relax here?

198
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,280
Oh?

199
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,480
Why are you so impatient?

200
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,240
What did you do?

201
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,480
Trust me, I've got this.

202
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,960
Someone like you?

203
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,360
Come with me
if you don't believe me.

204
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,120
Where to?

205
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,960
To where your brother,
aka my boyfriend, is.

206
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,880
You sure you've got this?

207
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,840
You're not in the same league as me.

208
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,840
You're just a small kid
who hugs a lion doll to sleep.

209
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,080
I'm not small.
Quite impressive actually.

210
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,600
I can handle it.
What about you though?

211
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,440
Well, so confident.

212
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,920
That's for sure.

213
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,440
Fuck.

214
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,960
I thought you've fucking got this!

215
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,360
- Leo.
- Stop it, stop.

216
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,040
Excuse me, he's my boyfriend.

217
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,320
P' Pob, I know my brother's perfect,
but I'm not too bad myself.

218
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,760
Fiat, calm down.

219
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,760
You're cheating on me?
Last night you said you'd only love me.

220
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,560
It's not what you think.

221
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,640
You've already got P' Fiat.
Why are you with my P' Pob?

222
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,960
Leo.

223
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
- P' Leo.
- Leo.

224
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,280
- P' Leo!
- Leo!

225
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,400
- P' Leo!
- Everyone please calm down.

226
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,240
So you're saying you and
P' Pob were talking about...

227
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,080
...a donation our family
makes to an orphanage?

228
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,480
Yeah.

229
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,240
Then why did you keep looking
at and asking about P' Leo?

230
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,960
He felt bad to ask for my help.

231
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,760
Why is that?

232
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Here's the thing.

233
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,320
I know Leo's family makes a
donation to the orphanage every year.

234
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,000
But...

235
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,640
We have many orphans this year.

236
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,560
The grant-in-aid and
the donation aren't enough.

237
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,960
The caregivers don't know what to
do because it's a small orphanage.

238
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
If we can't support the children...

239
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,040
...we may need to send
them to somewhere else.

240
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,080
So why did you come
talking to Leo yourself?

241
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,080
Because I'd lived in this
orphanage before I was adopted.

242
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,560
I'm sorry I made you misunderstand.

243
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,760
And thank you so much
for willing to help, Leo.

244
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,360
Don't mention it.
I'll contact the orphanage.

245
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,560
And don't worry, my
parents fully support this.

246
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,320
Then, if you'll excuse me.

247
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,480
P' Pob, let's talk.

248
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,320
Are you mad at me?

249
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,120
Do you think I'd steal
someone else's boyfriend?

250
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,480
No, it's not... I...

251
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,400
Keep this in mind, I never think
of stealing anyone's boyfriend.

252
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,520
It's because P' Leo's
better than me in everything.

253
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,200
He's more competent.

254
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,440
Kinder, more mature, more prudent.

255
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,520
My big brother's an all-around man.

256
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,920
Though I'm confident in myself...

257
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,600
...I can't compare with
my big brother at all.

258
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,920
Why do you compare
youself with him so much?

259
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,720
Leo is Leo.

260
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,840
Leon is Leon.

261
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,240
We don't need to be the same.

262
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
Then why didn't you tell me
about the donation?

263
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,440
I'm also a son of Thutanukul
family. I can help you.

264
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,840
The one who takes charge
of this matter is Leo, isn't he?

265
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,560
The caregivers said Leo subs for
your parents and visits there every year.

266
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,680
Besides.

267
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,520
Besides?

268
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,960
I didn't want you to feel I gave you ice
because I wanted money from you.

269
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,240
By the way, why are you
so bothered about this?

270
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,920
Because I like you.

271
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm pursuing you.

272
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,760
And I'm...

273
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,720
...going to be your boyfriend.

274
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,280
If you've got any problem next time,
let me be the first to know.

275
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,320
Let's go, I'll walk you to your dorm.

276
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,840
You're jealous.

277
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,240
Don't tell me it's the reason
you seduced me last night.

278
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Next time, if you want to know
something, just straight-up ask me.

279
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,680
Well...

280
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,360
You didn't tell me when
I asked you about P' Pob.

281
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
I couldn't tell you.

282
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,800
I didn't want to reveal P' Pob's story.

283
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,040
Because I know P' Pob, not from
Leon getting involved with him.

284
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,800
But from the cargivers who told me
he's in the same university as us.

285
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,360
He helps out at the
orphanage every week too.

286
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,800
You didn't want say that P' Pob
used to live in an orphanage?

287
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,840
Yes, I think he should
be the one to say it.

288
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,160
Whose boyfriend is this super nice guy?

289
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,880
But I'm glad.

290
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,120
About what?

291
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,240
To know that you're jealous.

292
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,640
What?

293
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,440
Who's jealous?
No one's jealous.

294
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,320
The toy.

295
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,960
It's pretty fun to use it
once in a while.

296
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,640
How about tonight?

297
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
Why are you frowning?

298
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,760
It's the game schedule, An.

299
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,480
Look who we're playing against.

300
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,280
Will Leo be alright?

301
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,080
The first game's gonna be a disaster.

302
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,480
P' Pob.

303
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,760
- Why are you running away from me?
- I'm not, I'm in a hurry.

304
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Where are you hurrying to?

305
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
To... Umm...

306
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,120
I'm meeting up with my report partners.

307
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,320
You're not avoiding me because
I said I wanted to pursue you, right?

308
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,560
Are you serious?

309
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,440
Why would I lie to you?

310
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,800
I like you, so I'm pursuing you.

311
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,960
Or you hate me?

312
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,760
Of course.

313
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,160
I can't compare to my brother at all.

314
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,400
I told you it's not like that.

315
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,480
- So you like me.
- Hey.

316
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,440
You don't hate me,
which means you like me.

317
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't hate you, but...

318
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,120
...I don't like you.

319
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,240
Okay, okay. Then I'll stop for today.

320
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,240
Since we're gonna be together,
there's no need to rush, right?

321
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,240
And this, is a gift.

322
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,120
Cunning.

323
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,280
How can I throw something like this away?

324
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,720
Doing laundry?

325
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,840
Yeah, it's stained with yours.

326
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,240
You're getting better at chores.

327
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,560
But you're way better.

328
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,040
You're the young master
with people to serve you.

329
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,320
But after we've moved here,
you can do everything.

330
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,000
Look at me, can't do a thing at all.

331
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,200
You're already good.

332
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,320
Don't forget, I went to summer camps.

333
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,960
It'd be bad if I couldn't do a thing.

334
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,080
I'll try harder.

335
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,400
I'm competent, I'll learn
everything in no time.

336
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah, you're competent.

337
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,280
If you can do it, so can I.

338
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,240
Leo!

339
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,640
Are you okay?

340
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,960
Are you hurt?

341
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,240
Sorry.

342
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,320
It's okay, you're cute when
you're trying hard.

343
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,080
Who's cute?

344
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,120
Come on, let's wash up.

345
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,360
- What's the rush?
- Your shirt is see-through.

346
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,880
P' Pob.

347
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,080
Good morning.

348
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,440
Why are you here?

349
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,480
I've promised you that I'll buy a meal.

350
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I told you it's fine.

351
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,480
Who says I'm gonna treat you?

352
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,560
I'm gonna treat Pobjer.

353
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,160
Just buying cat food,
I didn't need to come.

354
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,200
You couldn't not come.

355
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,240
Because I didn't know
Pobjer's food preferences.

356
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,600
I could tell you the brand.

357
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,680
They've got many
different types and flavors.

358
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,320
I wouldn't know what to buy.
It's only right that you come with me.

359
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,720
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

360
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,680
Wait a minute.

361
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,200
Pobjer's gotten her food.

362
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,280
But Leon's stomach's been
empty since the morning.

363
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,560
P' Pob who's kind-hearted
won't be cruel to Leon, right?

364
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,720
No wonder you got slapped.

365
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,440
Says who?

366
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,680
I don't act like this with anyone else.

367
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,480
I'm acting like this with you.

368
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,800
Because I'm serious about you.

369
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,960
Come here.

370
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,080
- Where are you taking me?
- Please follow me.

371
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,040
Here's your drink.

372
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,840
Pob's so cute.

373
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,240
Cute from this angle too.

374
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,680
Cute when drinking too.

375
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,000
Tissue.

376
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,760
Cute when blushing too.

377
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,440
You mean Pobjer, right?

378
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,320
Yes, I mean Pob...

379
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,600
...jer.

380
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,640
Why don't you call her Jer?

381
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,840
If I don't call her Jer, will you
think I'm complimenting you?

382
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,080
Leon.

383
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,960
Don't waste your time.

384
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,880
Go pursue someone else.

385
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,880
I like you, so why would I
pursue someone else?

386
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,640
I'm not interested in
a relationship now.

387
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,280
P' Pob, I'm not trying to force you.

388
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,760
I want to pursue you, so I'm doing it.

389
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,560
I'm happy enough
you're letting me pursue you.

390
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
Suit yourself.

391
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,200
When you start to fall for me, tell me.

392
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,800
I'll come on stronger.

393
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,560
What you're doing isn't strong?

394
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,920
It's just a beginning level.

395
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,640
Thank you for coming with me today.

396
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,160
It's me who should thank you
for thinking about Jer.

397
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,840
Dust.

398
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,120
I'm sorry.

399
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,040
I said I'd take it slow.

400
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,640
Then I'm going home now.

401
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,760
Though it's a tune-up game.

402
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,640
It's the first game that Fiat
gets to play after his knee injury.

403
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,080
What should we do, Leo?
Should we tell him he's not ready?

404
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,480
We can't.

405
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,080
He's really set his mind
to the game this time.

406
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,680
He kept asking for
the doctor's confirmation.

407
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,960
That he's able to play now.

408
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,520
Will it be alright?

409
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,960
Of course.

410
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,120
He may not look it, but when
he's determined, he gives his all.

411
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,480
Gosh, I'm not talking about Fiat.
I'm talking about you.

412
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,440
Will you be alright?

413
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,120
Of course.

414
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,280
I have to.

415
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,360
You're gonna lose to me again, Leo.

416
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,560
Why do we have to
watch today's game?

417
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,840
Don't know, bro.
An asked us to come.

418
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,440
It's no big deal.

419
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,840
Maybe I'll see something good
to tease Fiat.

420
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,480
Interesting.

421
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,800
Don't tease them today.
Let's support them.

422
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,520
What's going on?

423
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,360
I'll do my best.

424
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,320
Yeah, I'll do my best too.

425
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,920
I've heard you're dating.

426
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,320
Looks like it's true.

427
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,720
Why are you here?

428
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,600
Come on, man.

429
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,160
Though we're opponents
today, let's get chummy.

430
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,000
Because at the very least...

431
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,560
...you and I share a wife.

432
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,120
What did you say?

433
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,880
Hey! What's going on?

434
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,400
Leo, calm down.

435
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,440
And you.

436
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,880
Go back to where you came from.

437
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,120
See you at the game.

438
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,560
Don't think I didn't see that.

439
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,160
Poor you.

440
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,320
I have to film this.
What a filthy brat.
