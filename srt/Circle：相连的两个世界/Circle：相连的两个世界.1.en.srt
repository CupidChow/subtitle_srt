(Part 1: BETA Project)

00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,633
By the way, how did you find me?

10
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,466
(2007)

11
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:05,933
I told you, I can find you,
wherever you are.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ah, you mean like telepathy
between twins?

13
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,633
So much for telepathy.

14
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,033
I'll punish you if you ever
climb the mountain again.

15
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm serious, it's real this time.
It's an alien and a UFO.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,800
Do you have proof?
Do you have proof?

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,000
I do. Proof #1.

18
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:26,500
The fog!

19
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:29,333
The fog is formed by water vapor.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,366
Then how about this? Proof #2.
A burnt pine cone. I'm sure.

21
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,666
This pine cone was burnt
when the UFO landed.

22
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:42,466
Old men use them as firewood
when they collect medicinal herbs.

23
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:43,800
There's no such thing as aliens.

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,300
There are. Aliens exist.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
Those things don't exist.

26
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,066
Hop on. Hurry up.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,700
It's following us.
It's following us.

28
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:31,300
Hang on.

29
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:32,833
OK.

30
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,866
It's following us.
It's following us.

31
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,200
Hang on!

32
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,133
What the heck?

33
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,900
It's following us.
It's following us.

34
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,733
It keeps following us.

35
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,433
Hang on.

36
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,933
Kim Woo-jin. Kim Beom-gyun.

37
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,933
Dad.

38
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,666
Are you okay?

39
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,700
Dad.

40
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,233
Beom-gyun.

41
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Proof #3. An alien.

42
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey, Kim Woo-jin!

43
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,666
Woo-jin!

44
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,966
Kim Woo-jin.

45
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:41,466
The murderer president
must resign! Resign!

46
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,566
The tuition system punishing by
death must be abolished!

47
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,100
Hey, Kim Woo-jin!

48
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,933
Must be abolished! Abolished!

49
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,533
The murderer president who incites
a suicidal competition must resign!

50
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,200
Excuse me. Please let me through.

51
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,266
What the heck?

52
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:56,166
Thank you.

53
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,433
The murderer president who incites
a suicidal competition must resign!

54
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,866
That bastard.

55
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,666
Must resign! Resign!

56
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,233
Must be abolished! Abolished!

(Handam University of
Science and Technology, 2017)

58
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,900
They are all outside.
Let's hurry up.

59
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
- OK.
- OK.

60
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,300
Hey, Kim Woo-jin!

61
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,833
Didn't you hear me calling you?

62
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,000
What's your point?

63
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,100
Don't you know that we're refusing
to take exams together?

64
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,366
Do you only care about getting
summa cum laude, jerk?

65
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,833
Have you heard of getting
summa cum laude to survive?

66
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,866
What?

67
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,533
It's a real thing.

68
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,566
If you didn't know, learn about it.

69
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,200
What is that jerk talking about?

70
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,666
Why? What is it?

71
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,766
That Kim Woo-jin jerk
took the exam, alone.

72
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,366
He said he's getting
summa cum laude to survive.

73
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,233
What the heck is that?

74
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,233
He gets a corporate scholarship.

75
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,033
That's why he's trying
to get summa cum laude.

76
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,700
So he wants to get away, huh?
That psychopathic bastard.

77
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,333
Hello.

78
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Woo-jin, we didn't get
this month's payment

79
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,100
for your grandmother's
nursing home fee.

80
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,966
Yes, please, a few more days.

81
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,300
Is Grandma okay?

82
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
Hey, hey, hey.

83
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:08,333
Do you want a red candy?
Or a blue candy?

84
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,333
I'll give you both.
You can have them all!

85
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,166
Now hush, don't cry!

86
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm a human! I'm not a ghost.

87
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:23,066
There's no such thing as a ghost.

88
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:27,400
Yes, there is.
My friend said that he saw one.

89
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,766
Your friend was mistaken.

90
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,133
When the signals to the brain
gets distorted, it causes fear.

91
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,966
So he mistook it for seeing a ghost.

92
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,900
What?

93
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,866
There's no such thing as a ghost.
So don't believe that, OK?

94
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,900
There, there. Go out that way.

95
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:29,033
(Ji-hyuk… is dead…
another suicide…)

96
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,400
(Ji-hyuk… Ji-hyuk… committed…)

97
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,566
(Woo-jin, Ji-hyuk is dead)

98
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,566
(Hey! Ji-hyuk is dead)

99
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,266
(I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you, Ji-hyuk…)

100
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Professor.

101
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,033
Uh, yes?

102
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:16,566
Aren't you going to hire
a new research assistant?

103
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,166
What?

104
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:22,533
I thought that you might recruit
someone to take Ji-hyuk's place.

105
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,366
Do you have to say that now?

106
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,166
Today's not a good time.

107
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:36,366
Yes, that's true.

108
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,300
But I wanted to tell you
my thoughts

109
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,633
before other students do.

110
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,333
I'm sorry.

111
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,466
Hey, Kim Woo-jin.

112
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:19,333
Are you happy? Huh?
Because Ji-hyuk died?

113
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,133
Looks like you really
waited for this, huh?

114
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,000
And you took the exam
alone too, right?

115
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,066
This damn system never changes

116
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,033
because of bastards like you.

117
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,966
Bastards like you
killed Ji-hyuk, get it?

118
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,033
You think you're better
than everyone else, huh?

119
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,400
You don't care about others' lives
if only you can survive, right?

120
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,066
Do we look that low to you?

121
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,333
Answer me, you bastard!

122
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,833
Does the world…

123
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,500
Look that low to you?

124
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,200
What?

125
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,733
You're taking the high positions
using your social connections.

126
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,833
You made Ji-hyuk do all the work

127
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,300
and you took all the credit.

128
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,233
Don't you think it's not right
to act like a hero now?

129
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,033
You bastard.

130
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,333
Did your brother get out of prison?

131
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,033
I heard that he went to jail
right after the mental hospital.

132
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,933
Why did you do that? Tell me!

133
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:29,766
Sir, calm down, please.

134
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:32,100
- Tell me!
- Sir, calm down.

135
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,700
Beom-gyun.

136
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,433
Woo-jin.

137
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:01,300
No, his prison term
isn't over yet.

138
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,733
Since you are worried,
I'll tell you beforehand.

139
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,833
If we work together,

140
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,166
don't even think
about bullying me.

141
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:09,800
What did you say, you bastard?

142
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,500
I am,

143
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,433
a super smart and bratty,

144
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,533
no-good bastard.

145
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:56,266
(Rest in peace)

146
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,966
(We're sorry, rest in peace,
Oh Ji-hyuk)

147
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,133
(My dear friend,
hope you're in Heaven)

148
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,466
(Oh Ji-hyuk, we miss you so much)

149
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,000
So, someone was next to
Oh Ji-hyuk?

150
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,233
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

151
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,233
Did you see the face?

152
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,500
It was dark,
so I couldn't see the face,

153
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,033
but that person was
holding something.

154
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,666
What? A knife?

155
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,866
No. It was rectangular.

156
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,033
An electric shaver?

157
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,866
Was this the one?

158
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:49,300
Ah, yes. Aha. It was a stun gun.

159
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,833
Are you sure?

160
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,600
Yes, I am. A stun gun.

161
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,900
Ah, a stun gun.

162
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,600
Woo-jin.

163
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,700
I told you to carry it
with you all the time.

164
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,633
You never know
when they will attack.

165
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,300
You are that alien I saw before.

166
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
I am not.

167
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,600
Don't lie to me.

168
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:56,633
You are that alien
from before. You are.

169
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,233
You are that alien.

170
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:03,400
What the heck?

171
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,833
Come on.

172
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,966
No.

173
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,200
No way. That can't be.

174
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,866
Beom-gyun is incarcerated.

175
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,933
Hey, Kim Woo-jin! Hey!

176
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,366
Hey, how have you been?

177
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,933
What? What happened?
Why are you out so early?

178
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,500
You're a good student,
I'm a good prisoner!

179
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:24,533
I was paroled for being
a model prisoner.

180
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,400
So you got out today?

181
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,933
Yeah.

182
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,800
Did you come to school
by any chance?

183
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:35,866
School?

184
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,500
My school.

185
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,233
Didn't you come to my school?

186
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,266
Why would I?

187
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,266
I came straight home.

188
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:45,400
What? Aren't you happy to see me?

189
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,866
It's not that.

190
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,466
You should've called me.
I could've went to pick you up.

191
00:19:56,533 --> 00:20:00,900
Come on, you're a college student
always busy studying…

192
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,833
You thought I'd say that, huh?

193
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,266
You jerk!
Aren't you happy to see me?

194
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,966
- Let go!
- No way!

195
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,333
No way?

196
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,500
Ouch! It hurts!

197
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,133
You've gotten stronger!

198
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,133
That tickles.

199
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,233
The alert on ultrafine particles
all over the country

200
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,666
has remained active for a week.

201
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:27,766
Therefore, the government announced
a weather reduction measure

202
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,566
following the special measure
on the fine particles.

203
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:32,233
T-Palace in Dogok-dong,
Gangnam-gu,

204
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,633
now has its offerings
for $3.7 million,

205
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,600
which were $5 million in 2006…

206
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,733
- It's so delicious.
- Slow down.

207
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,433
Is it that delicious?

208
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,566
I think I had dreams of
eating chicken like…

209
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,933
about a hundred times.

210
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,166
Ugh, stop it already.

211
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,533
Seriously.

212
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,766
What is that?

213
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,466
Ha!

214
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:08,066
Hey, let your brother eat
the drumsticks.

215
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,400
Ha… I'll let you eat it this once.

216
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,400
What is it?

217
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,066
A spam message.

218
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,966
No, I mean the phone.

219
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,566
Did you buy it?

220
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,533
Ah, I got it.
The number's still the same.

221
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,500
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

222
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:28,966
What are you doing?

223
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,866
To celebrate my parole!
Smile! Say cheese!

224
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,533
Come on, smile for once!
Say cheese!

225
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,633
1, 2, 3, smile!

226
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,500
Stop it and eat your chicken.

227
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,066
OK, OK.

228
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,400
Hey, by the way,
I think chicken is

229
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,100
the most delicious thing
in the world.

230
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,433
Ugh, stop being dramatic.

231
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,166
Oh, come on.

232
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,966
This is how I am.

233
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,566
What are you doing?

234
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,666
Ah.

235
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:16,933
Laundry. I'm checking if
I have to do any.

236
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,566
Woo-jin.

237
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,166
I'm okay now.

238
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,466
That's totally out of nowhere.

239
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:29,133
You're trying to
check that thing out.

240
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,366
I don't do things that'll
make you worried anymore.

241
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,100
We have to think of grandma, too.

242
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,366
I will never go to jail again.
Ever.

243
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:47,500
I won't leave you alone again.

244
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,300
I was going to tell you later,
but…

245
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
Actually, I'm…

246
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,300
A patissier.

247
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,133
What?

248
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:04,100
You study so much and
you don’t know what is?

249
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,700
Patissier means "baker" in French.

250
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:09,633
Come on, I know what that means.

251
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,500
But, are you serious?

252
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:14,066
I even got a job.

253
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:15,833
At Han Deuk-gi's Bakery
in front of your school.

254
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,800
Really?

255
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:18,800
Tomorrow's my first day at work.

256
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:22,633
So you just need to
focus on your studies.

257
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,500
I will support you from now on.

258
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,733
I will take all of the expired bread
from that bakery! Okay?

259
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,766
Man… you're only
a minute older than I am.

260
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,433
Yeah, I breathed air
a minute before you did.

261
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,366
So you're the younger brother.
Get it, little bro?

262
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,600
You arrogant jerk.

263
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,666
Ugh.

264
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:52,300
Hey.

265
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,166
- Are you defying me?
- What are you doing?

266
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,366
Let go!
I'm going to do the laundry.

267
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,400

so please wait.

272

No. Why would I?

276

Hey. Where are you?

279
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:41,066
Me? I'm at work.

280
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,433
Why? What happened?

281
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,233
No, it's just…

282
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,633
By the way, do you know
anybody at my school?

283
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,833
No. Why?

284
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:57,966
Are you sure?

285
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,633
Hey, you're the only college student
I know. You know that.

286
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,466
OK.

287
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,133
When will you be out of work?

288
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,966
After I wrap things up,
maybe around 8?

289
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,066
By the way, Woo-jin,
are you going to have dinner?

290
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:20,066
I'll eat it on my own.
Take it easy at work.

291
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,833
OK.

Yeah.

00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,000
You said you got out yesterday.

No, I tried to help.

suspicion and I confirmed it.

when everything is clear.

322

323

this time.

327
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,300
actually sure before?

different world? Why?

333
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:38,933

335

taking dad away.

Don't deny reality.
Aliens do exist.

You're the one
who's denying reality.

339
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,533
Dad simply abandoned us.

340

No, no. Aliens do exist.

This woman is the alien.

345
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,833
Woo-jin, think about it rationally.

346
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,300
Aren't the students
at your school weird?

347
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,100
Why do the students die
without any reason?

348
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,833
It's because of the alien.
She killed them all.

349
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,333
Do you have proof?

350
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:07,900
Do you have proof?

351
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,466
Yes.

352
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:13,900
I do.

353
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:16,066
And you will accept it right away.

354

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,200
If you're wrong again,

356
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,133
go back to the hospital.

357

00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,266
The 2nd floor.

362
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,933
The 2nd floor what?

363
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,666
This is the alien's hideout.

364
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:20,800
Let's go.

365
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,433
Be careful. It may be in there.

366
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,133
Woo-jin. Hey, Woo-jin.

367
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,833
What?

368
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,233
What do you see here?

369
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,133
This can't be.

370
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,733
Everything was here
until yesterday.

371
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,333
Did it notice and run away?

372
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,700
If not, then how…?

373
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,833
It's been watching me.

374
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:20,600
If not, then this isn't possible.

375
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,100
Hey, Woo-jin.

376
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,533
It was really here yesterday.

377
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,966
That woman was here.
She was standing here.

378
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:31,933
That woman was here, Woo-jin.

379
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,066
That woman was here.

380
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,400
That alien was here. I swear.

381
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,900
The alien.

382
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,166
Beom-gyun! Beom-gyun!

383
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,700
Beom-gyun!

384
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,966
Don't do this to me, please.

385
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,333
I…

386
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,666
I had a really hard time.

387
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,966
I need you. Get it?

388
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,800
So please stop this

389
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,800
and just stay by my side.

390
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:38,366
Forget about dad.

391
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,333
Even if he returns,
nothing changes.

392
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
It's not just because of dad.

393
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:48,666
If, if aliens really don't exist,

394
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:51,100
then…

395
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,833
Then it means that
I'm actually crazy.

396
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,833
It's not too late.
She must be around.

397
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,433
No. Beom-gyun, please.

398
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,300
Woo-jin, we can catch it.

399
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:10,666
Woo-jin, we must catch it.
Woo-jin.

400
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,400
Let go!

401
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,366
Hey, Kim Beom-gyun.

402
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,266
Brother. Don’t do this.

403
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:30,133
Beom-gyun.

404
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,933
Beom-gyun.

405
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:41,100
Beom-gyun.

406
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,800
What is it?

407
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,900
Why?

408
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,633
Proof #3.

409
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,366
An alien.

410
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,200
An alien.

411
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,833
According to the survey
by Statistics Korea, 2037,

412
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,066
(Seoul, General Earth, 2037)

413
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,333
the population of Seoul
has decreased by 50%

414
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:04,800
compared to 2017,

415
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,833
and it's now within
the 5 million range

416
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:08,633
for the first time since 1970.

417
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:10,166
Due to the serious pollution
in the city,

418
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:13,300
the rich people are quickly moving
to Smart Earth,

419
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,333
the General Earth, such as
Gangnam and Yeouido,

420
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,900
is suffering from
serious urban emptiness.

421
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:21,166
The crime rate has also rocketed,

422
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:23,766
so the government is about to
take some actions.

423
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,833
The number of illegal aliens
are sharply increasing,

424
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,200
and the estimated number is
1 million and higher.

425
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:31,600
Seoul Metropolitan Government
announced that it will

426
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,066
identify the illegal aliens

427
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:33,533
(Part 2. Amazing New World)

428
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:36,800
in order to deport or isolate them.

429
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,266
An announcement for the
citizens of General Earth.

430
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:24,200
The fine particles saturation
has surpassed the safety standard.

431
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,433
Please seal all windows
and ventilation systems.

432
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,766
And please wear the oxygen mask
we provided you when going outside.

433
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:35,566
An announcement for the
citizens of General Earth.

434
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,866
This is it.

435
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,266
Now.

436
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,300
What do we have here?

437
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,800
Oh, my goodness.

438
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,366
You know that you almost
got divorced this time, right?

439
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:31,466
I do. Thank you.

440
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,700
You really are
the best hacker ever.

441
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,600
Now then, I will take this.

442
00:42:54,466 --> 00:42:56,600
Sir, I will call you again.

443
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,300
Oh, man!

444
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:00,966
Hold it right there.

445
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,700
Hey! Stop!

446
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,600
Get out of the way.

447
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,800
Ugh, that jerk is going up again.

448
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,133
Open it. Open it.

449
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:41,366
Hey!

450
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:44,333
Hey!

451
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,033
Get him!

452
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:15,066
We're not here to catch you today!

453
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:16,900
Go on. Eat your food.

454
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,300
Chief.

455
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:25,033
Dong-soo already went down, huh?
You guys go down, too.

456
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:27,400
I missed Dong-soo.

457
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:29,033
Is he there? Are you sure?

458
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,666
Open it.

459
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,900
Get him! Get him!

460
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,466
Hurry up and get him!

461
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:46,266
Wow, this is tiring.

462
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,866
Get him already.

463
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:50,266
Ugh, that guy has a lot of energy.

464
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:55,133
Dong-soo, Dong-soo,
we need to talk.

465
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,900
Dong-soo, we need to talk. Please.

466
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:11,600
Dong-soo.

467
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,033
Long time no see, you jerk.

468
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:16,633
Long time no see, you jerk.

469
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,633
Stop following me, damn it.

470
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,533
Dong-soo, that's a dead end.
You can't do anything now.

471
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:34,966
Hey, what are you?

472
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,200
Don't come any closer.

473
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:51,133
Dong-soo prepared a lot, huh?

474
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:45,033
Those bastards. Damn it.

475
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,866
Only if I didn't injure my legs.

476
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:49,700
Man, Detective Oh is just…

477
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,000
Good job. Well done.

478
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,866
I'm so thankful for you,
so, who are you?

479
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:57,066
Ow! My nose!

480
00:46:57,133 --> 00:46:58,633
What are you? You bastard!

481
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:07,566
It's me, Dong-soo.
Did you miss me?

482
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,766
Kim Joon-hyuk.

483
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,766
- Come here. Come here.
- Ah, stop. Wait.

484
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,966
Joon-hyuk. Joon-hyuk.

485
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:27,366
Hey, they're gone. Get up. Now.

486
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:29,900
I thought I really
was getting beaten.

487
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,200
I don't fit into his action stunts.
It's too hard.

488
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,633
He might kill all of you
if he directs two more stunts.

489
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,066
This hurts.

490
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:39,333
You sneaky fuss.

491
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:43,000
Hurry up. Hurry up.

492
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,200
I told you I can't do it.

493
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:46,366
You can't?

494
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:48,166
Yeah, then go. Sure.

495
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:49,633
OK.

496
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,266
Lee Dong-soo, on May 26th, 2037,

497
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:56,600
you are relieved
from the violation of

498
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,166
the Personal Information
Protection Act.

499
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,066
So the debt you must pay to
Detective Kim Joon-hyuk

500
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,666
is now 1, 2, 3, 4…

501
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:07,866
That's a total of 8.

502
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:11,300
Dong-soo, I put all of my
effort and heart like this,

503
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:12,900
so you should repay me too, right?

504
00:48:12,966 --> 00:48:13,733
Even animals repay those
who helped them.

505
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,300
I didn't ask you to
save me all the time.

506
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:16,800
And this is a kind of situation

507
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:19,100
that you hurt me on purpose
and sent me to a hospital.

508
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,600
Are you ready for
a heavenly punishment…

509
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,933
You little…
Don’t make me use violence.

510
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:29,200
I will be generous
and give you a week.

511
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:29,966
So…

512
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:31,333
Joon-hyuk. Hacking the Smart Earth
is every hacker's dream.

513
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,666
(Smart Earth)
(A new city where the entrance
of non-residents are forbidden)

514
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:36,233
Why? Because no bastard ever
hacked into that city.

515
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,133
Dong-soo, Dong-soo.
Why are you so small-minded?

516
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,233
You can do it. You're a genius.

517
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,533
There's no other way besides
you putting a chip in your head.

518
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,900
If I knew that, I'd already
done it. You bastard.

519
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:48,400
So I can't hack into Smart Earth,

520
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:50,333
and you can't punch a hole
on your pretty head.

521
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,133
There's no way we can go in there.

522
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,666
You always said that you're
#1 in this business.

523
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,766
I said that I'm an official #1.

524
00:48:57,866 --> 00:48:59,233
Is there an unofficial #1, then?

525
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,000
It's a rumor. A rumor.

526
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,733
Who is it?

527
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:05,466
He's a legendary hacker like me
in this business.

528
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:07,200
He's called Blue Bird.

529
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,466
Blue Bird?

530
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:12,300
Yes. Blue Bird.

531
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,100
The rumor says that
he's a human, or an AI,

532
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,533
or that he hacked into Smart Earth,

533
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,400
but you never know if it's true.
Those are all rumors.

534
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:22,700
Find him.

535
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:24,300
I told you that
those are all rumors.

536
00:49:24,366 --> 00:49:25,400
I don't even know if it is human.

537
00:49:25,466 --> 00:49:28,900
I'll give you a week.
Find him no matter what.

538
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,833
Hey, Kim Joon-hyuk!
Hey! Where's Detective Kim?

539
00:49:36,866 --> 00:49:40,766
(General Earth,
Gangnam Police Station)

540
00:49:40,766 --> 00:49:42,733
Did you scout him? Did he say yes?

541
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,366
He'll be killed by me
if he doesn't cooperate.

542
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,566
By the way, can we really
break into Smart Earth?

543
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:52,366
Dong-soo is the only way
we can break in, anyway.

544
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:54,233
Anyway, keep this in mind.

545
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,066
If they find that we directed this,
I have nothing to do with this.

546
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:59,133
- Come on.
- Why?

547
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,166
You're the director.

548
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:03,666
Joon-hyuk, I'm retiring soon.

549
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:06,066
If I get fired now,
I can't get my annuity.

550
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,133
So you need to be in charge
more than anyone else.

551
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:10,266
I have a future waiting ahead.

552
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:12,233
At least you can do manual labor
when you lose this job.

553
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,633
I'm old now. Even breathing is
a hard work for me.

554
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:16,833
Oh, please.

555
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,833
You already have a backup.

556
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,166
What should I do?
Shall I go tell it?

557
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:22,766
Hey.

558
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,233
About you working two jobs?

559
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,866
Hey.

560
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,433
I may be talkative,

561
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,566
but I always listened to you.

562
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,033
So just sit down and wait.

563
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:46,166
How clever. Ha.

564
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:48,433
How did he think of that?

565
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:48,933
Yikes!

566
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:51,966
Hey, what are you doing
during working hours?

567
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:54,866
Ah, I'm reading some webtoon.

568
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,066
What's the title?

569
00:50:57,133 --> 00:50:59,933
Ah, it's called "Sherlock Holmes:
Cold Case Files,"

570
00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:02,166
and it's 100% based on
true stories.

571
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:04,966
It's like a super realistic
detective comics.

572
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:06,366
It's so realistic.

573
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:08,200
Is it that good?

574
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:09,900
It's quite OK.

575
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,833
But it's so unpopular,

576
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:13,200
I'm worried that it might

577
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,433
discontinue in the middle.

578
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,200
Hey!

579
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,933
It just needs to be good.
What do you know about it?

580
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:23,033
But I'm reading it, you know.
Why are you getting angry?

581
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,966
Hey, I'm Sherlock Holmes…

582
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,900
Really? Hold on.

583
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,433
See? See?

584
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,566
You look totally different.

585
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,766
Don't lie to me, please.

586
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,300
Hey, hey, hey.

587
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,000
If you want to continue
reading this webtoon…

588
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,000
OK?

589
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,933
Help the poor old man so
he can buy cigarettes, OK?

590
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:56,200
Are you serious?

591
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:01,366
Sherlock Holmes?

592
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:07,700
Wow, so all 3 of these cold cases

593
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:09,600
were your stories?

594
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,800
You can say that he's
a true artist.

595
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:14,300
The creativity that turns
his own pain into art

596
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:16,666
to get paid for it.

597
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,633
Hey, don't you think
it's respectful?

598
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,766
Shouldn't you applaud by now?
You said you're a fan.

599
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:23,500
Yes, sure.

600
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:26,933
Chief, please tell me more.

601
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:30,166
I was particularly impressed
by Season 1.

602
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:34,100
Yes, that case. In my 30 years
of life as a detective,

603
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,433
that's how the cold case started.

604
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:41,366
Handam University
serial murder case.

605
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,833
Uh, are you saying that
the case was not suicide,

606
00:52:57,933 --> 00:52:59,933
but a series of intentional murders?

607
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,500
My excellent hunches
were never wrong.

608
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:04,933
I'm sure it was murder.

609
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,766
Oh! That sounds plausible.

610
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,733
Then what about Kim Min-ji case
in Season 2?

611
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,466
That guy you captured
but got released!

612
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:12,500
Is he the real culprit?

613
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:16,966
Search the area. Now.

614
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:18,566
Yes, sir.

615
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,600
(Ha…)

616
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,300
(That bastard…)

617
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,633
I caught that Gong Min-woo
and even indicted him,

618
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,000
but he was released because
there wan't enough evidence.

619
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:49,800
Come on, let's forget
about that, OK?

620
00:53:49,866 --> 00:53:51,800
Don't you know about the
rule of double jeopardy?

621
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:54,100
I can never admit that
double jeopardy thingy.

622
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,233
You must never kidnap

623
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,366
someone else's child. Okay?

624
00:53:58,466 --> 00:54:00,866
By the way, what about Season 3
you announced?

625
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:02,500
What's that 3rd case?

626
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,566
The 3rd case was…

627
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,366
Ugh.

628
00:54:09,466 --> 00:54:13,600
The city with no disease,
no misfortune, no crime.

629
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,733
The city everyone dreamed of.

630
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,666
With the Safety Care System,
Smart Earth has marked

631
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:21,566
its 5,000th day without crime.

632
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,933
Human B makes a safe and stable world.

633
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,833
It's a good place to live, so what?
You need money to get in.

634
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,633
Even money is no use.
You'll lose your job there.

635
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:34,433
There's no crime there.
Detectives can't work there.

636
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:36,433
I might find something.

637
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:38,600
Anyway, what's the 3rd cold case?

638
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,466
The 3rd case.

639
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:41,166
Please tell me about it.

640
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:48,133
The case of missing twins.

641
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,766
The case of missing twins?

642
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:53,433
In 2017, twin brothers went missing
near the Handam University area.

643
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,766
No credit card records, no call logs,
no traces of running away.

644
00:54:56,833 --> 00:55:00,666
They remain missing in 2037.

645
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:03,433
My, how do you know so much
about his case?

646
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:07,033
Hey, he plays automatically
when he gets drunk.

647
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:09,666
If I hear it one more time,
that marks the 10,000th time.

648
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:11,533
Ah.

649
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:14,400
Let's mark the 10,000th time.
Please tell me.

650
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,500
The case of missing twins.

651
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,033
Let's go somewhere else.
It's a long story.

652
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,233
I'll buy the 2nd round
this time. For sure.

653
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:26,333
(Missing)

654
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:48,666
Hello, General Earth, Gangnam
Police Station, violent crimes.

655
00:55:51,733 --> 00:55:53,733
Yes. Yes. Who?

656
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,933
What's the relationship?
Is she your daughter?

657
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,800
Yes, okay.

658
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:06,566
How old are you?

659
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:09,233
Aha. I see. Okay.

660
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:13,066
How on earth can we
go there that fast?

661
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,133
No prank calls, please.

662
00:56:17,866 --> 00:56:19,300
What is it?

663
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,266
Someone got kidnapped.

664
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:32,400
Smart Earth?

665
00:56:32,466 --> 00:56:34,066
Yes.

666
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,166
Would you like to listen to it?

667
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,166
Please help. Got kidnapped.

668
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:48,066
What? Who?

669
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:49,433
Kim Min-ji.

670
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:51,333
- What's the relationship?
- Kim Min-ji?

671
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:54,200
I am Kim Min-ji. I got kidnapped.

672
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,200
They are back.

673
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,666
Yes, OK. How old are you?

674
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:02,933
I'm 7 years old.

675
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,633
Aha. I see. Okay.

676
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,466
39, Area 13, Smart Earth.

677
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:08,966
OK.

678
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:10,566
Please hurry and come fast. Please.

679
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:13,800
How on earth can we go
there that fast?

680
00:57:13,866 --> 00:57:15,766
No prank calls, please.

681
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,266
Then I'll take care of it.

682
00:57:20,866 --> 00:57:22,566
Track this number down.

683
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,500
Why should we track down
the prank call number?

684
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,300
Just do it, you jerk.

685
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:32,033
Huh? I found it.

686
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,466
And her name really is Kim Min-ji.

687
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:36,566
It's that girl from back then.

688
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:37,633
What kind of situation is this?

689
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,866
Is the Kim Min-ji from that case
is this Kim Min-ji?

690
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:44,366
Did something happen to
Kim Min-ji again?

691
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:46,333
Are you sure?

692
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,200
Tell them there was a call
from Smart Earth.

693
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,266
Hey, track this number down.
Quickly.

694
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:52,833
Ah, yes.

695
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,133
I found its location.

696
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:03,700
39, Area 13, Dreamville 301,
Smart Earth.

697
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:05,433
But you know…

698
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:07,500
It's Gong Min-woo's house.

699
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:08,533
Gong Min-woo?

700
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,933
You know, the guy Chief caught
but got released 20 years ago.

701
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,066
The suspect of the case.
Gong Min-woo.

702
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:18,900
That psychopatic bastard.

703
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,266
Jin-hong. Jin-hong.

704
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,300
Chief!

705
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,900
That psychopatic bastard.

706
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,633
Jin-hong, I'm sorry,
but this is the chance.

707
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:33,100
What?

708
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,833
The chance for you to
catch Gong Min-woo

709
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:37,333
and for me to enter Smart Earth.

710
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:42,366
I have to enter this time. OK?

711
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:45,766
(Smart Earth,
The outside immigration)

712
00:58:45,766 --> 00:58:50,000
You cannot enter unless you
insert the Safety Care Chip.

713
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,666
Please wait in line
in front of the entrance.

714
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,600
AIR B347, to Smart Earth.

715
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,566
Departing in 30 minutes.

716
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:04,366
Please move to Gate #3 to board.

717
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,766
Enjoy a peaceful life in
Smart Earth, the city of dreams.

718
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:13,133
Please check your seat number.

719
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,566
Police.

720
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:16,000
We got a call from Smart Earth.

721
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:16,700
A call?

722
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:19,333
- It's a kidnapping in Smart Earth.
- What?

723
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,333
Someone got kidnapped?

724
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,333
What? Kidnapped?

725
00:59:22,766 --> 00:59:24,633
Oh, no.

726
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:27,966
Did you bring the warrant?

727
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:29,866
There's no time for an warrant.

728
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,800
We must do things
according to the manual.

729
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,966
Please bring the warrant.

730
00:59:34,066 --> 00:59:35,900
Man, I'm going crazy.

731
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,066
A citizen of Smart Earth
is now in danger.

732
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:39,766
What's going on?

733
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:42,966
I'm Lee Ho-soo, from security
department of Smart Earth.

734
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:45,100
Kim Joon-hyuk, from Gangnam Police
Station, General Earth.

735
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:48,033
We got a call from Smart Earth
about being kidnapped.

736
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:51,500
They should take actions
when someone's kidnapped.

737
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:53,366
Please, come with me.

738
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:56,700
You got a call from Smart Earth?

739
00:59:56,766 --> 00:59:59,133
Someone got kidnapped.
We have to go.

740
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,033
A crime happened in there.

741
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,466
That's not possible by common sense.

742
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,533
What?

743
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:06,766
Crimes don't take place
in Smart Earth.

744
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:07,766
It's all thank to the
Stable Care System.

745
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:09,166
(Stable Care)

746
01:00:09,266 --> 01:00:12,400
(The core system of Smart Earth
that controls emotions
to make people emotionally stable)

747
01:00:14,366 --> 01:00:16,200
Then what's this? Huh?

748
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,100
Please help. Got kidnapped.

749
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:22,866
Let go. I said let go.

750
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:27,233
You just heard it.
A woman got kidnapped.

751
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:33,533
How can I believe that?

752
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
An adult woman
claiming to be 7 years old?

753
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:37,833
The call was sent from Smart Earth.

754
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:39,200
It's a prank by a hacker.

755
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,333
What? A hacker?

756
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:43,800
Everyone in Smart Earth are
all under the Stable Care.

757
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,200
They never want to commit crimes.

758
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:50,066
You bastard, how can you smile?

759
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:52,000
Will you be responsible
if that woman dies?

760
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:54,200
Kim Min-ji is in danger,
you bastard.

761
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,300
Joon-hyuk, move out.

762
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,666
You're quite rude, Detective.

763
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,466
I think you're the most
dangerous person here.

764
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:14,300
What?

765
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,500
What kind of place is this?

766
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,300
Please go back.

767
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,366
There is no way a person can die
in Smart Earth

768
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,833
by any common sense.

769
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:31,400
Then,

770
01:01:31,466 --> 01:01:32,966
farewell.

771
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,300
What? They all have the
same facial expressions.

772
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,933
Hey, Detective Oh. What?

773
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,000
Send it to me now. OK.

774
01:01:49,633 --> 01:01:51,200
What is it?

775
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:56,966
Chief, we have to go in there.

776
01:01:57,033 --> 01:01:59,433
Hey! How can we go in there?
We don't even have a warrant.

777
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,533
We have to go in there.
No matter what.

778
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:10,500
Yes, sir.

779
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:12,100
There's Code Zero on
Mr. Lee Ho-soo's area.

780
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,066
(An alert from the City Hall
security department)

781
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,700
Return to City Hall immediately.

782
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,200
(when a Smart Earth citizen dies))

783
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,800
Is it murder by any chance?

784
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,566
How did you know?

785
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,500
Detectives from General Earth
got a call and came here.

786
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,900
This case must never be
revealed to the public.

787
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,066
Aaaahhh!

788
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:42,200
Chief, Chief.

789
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,100
He's crazy. Right?

790
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:48,700
Hey.

791
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,900
Stop!

792
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:55,333
Stop!

793
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:57,066
Stop!

794
01:03:12,766 --> 01:03:14,333
Open it.

795
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,266
What are you doing?

796
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,266
Was this the truth of
5,000 days without crime?

797
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,200
How long have you been hiding?

798
01:03:20,266 --> 01:03:21,000
Detective Kim.

799
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:24,333
How long have you been hiding
and manipulating things?

800
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,166
There isn't a single concealment
or lie about this

801
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:29,966
in Smart Earth…

802
01:03:30,466 --> 01:03:32,366
Can you be responsible
for your words?

803
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,400
Yes.

804
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,600
I'll ask you one last time.

805
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,266
Can you be responsible
for your words?

806
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:39,433
Yes, I can be responsible.

807
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,233
Then be responsible.

808
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,366
Kim Min-ji sent this
5 minutes ago.

809
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,666
Now can you say that
there's no crime?

810
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:03,733
A murder in Smart Earth…

811
01:04:04,266 --> 01:04:06,833
If this is revealed, the press and
the public will go insane.

812
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:09,400
Do you think something is wrong
about the Human B system?

813
01:04:09,466 --> 01:04:10,600
We must silence
that detective first.

814
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:10,766
(Yoon Hak-joo,
the mayor of Smart Earth)

815
01:04:10,766 --> 01:04:13,666
If we can't, there's no way we can
handle this disaster.

816
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:20,800
Connect me to that detective.

817
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,600
Mayor Yoon Hak-joo is on the line.

818
01:04:27,266 --> 01:04:30,033
Wow, even a VR goggle
looks like you here.

819
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,866
It's pretentious.

820
01:04:31,966 --> 01:04:35,266
You're keep pretentiously smiling.
What are you, a clown?

821
01:04:35,366 --> 01:04:37,233
The mayor awaits.

822
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,166
I'm Yoon Hak-joo,
the mayor of Smart Earth.

823
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:53,200
I'm Kim Joon-hyuk from Gangnam
Police Station, General Earth.

824
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:54,866
I'll make things clear for you.

825
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:58,400
We do not want this case to be
revealed to the public.

826
01:04:59,866 --> 01:05:01,733
I can't do that.

827
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,866
You advertised about a city
with no crime like crazy.

828
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:07,000
Well, that's how things are
where people live.

829
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:07,833
But you know,

830
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:10,433
people living here should know

831
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:13,266
about the place they live, right?

832
01:05:16,133 --> 01:05:17,900
What do you want?

833
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,200
I'll do it.

834
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:24,300
Let me be in charge of this case.

835
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:28,000
I'll go into Smart Earth

836
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:31,166
and solve this case quickly
without a hitch.

837
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:33,533
Quickly without a hitch?

838
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,733
But I'm not inserting that chip
into my head.

839
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:38,066
Anyone without the Care Chip

840
01:05:38,066 --> 01:05:39,400
(Care Chip)

841
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,366
cannot enter Smart Earth.

842
01:05:40,366 --> 01:05:41,233
(A chip inserted into human body
to connect to Stable Care System
of Smart Earth)

843
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:42,366
That's our rule.

844
01:05:42,466 --> 01:05:43,933
The rule is already broken.

845
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:45,833
Mayor, do you still think that
Human B System is perfect?

846
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:46,766
(Human B System)

847
01:05:46,866 --> 01:05:47,733
(A system that maintains Smart Earth
without disease, misfortune,)

848
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:49,166
(and crime, using Stable Care
System as the basis)

849
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:50,966
We're dealing with a murderer.

850
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:53,666
We can't catch her with
the Stable Care.

851
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:58,600
Do you want the citizens to
know about this case?

852
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,566
Wouldn't it be better to
solve it as soon as possible?

853
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:07,566
Or shall I get the warrant and
make this an open investigation?

854
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,733
You may enter.

855
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,600
Let's discuss the details
when we meet in person.

856
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:26,600
No crimes by common sense?

857
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,533
That's just wonderful, isn't it?

858
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,133
And,

859
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,866
what is that, a school uniform?

860
01:06:32,933 --> 01:06:39,200
Even the outfits are
pretentious here, like you. Ha!

861
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,800
Come on, stop watching it.
It's horrible.

862
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,166
Am I a worthless garbage to think

863
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:59,200
that I'm glad that Min-ji
isn't the victim?

864
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,233
If Kim Min-ji was attacked by
this bastard again,

865
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,133
I can never rest in peace.

866
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,300
But I'm quite glad that the victim
is Gong Min-woo.

867
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:12,900
I'm garbage, aren't I?

868
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,466
Yes.

869
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,900
You're garbage to think that way

870
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,400
and I'm garbage to enter
Smart Earth using it.

871
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:25,566
Please wrap things up for me.

872
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,066
What about you?

873
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:31,000
How can I put handcuffs on Min-ji?

874
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,166
And solve that case, too.

875
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,466
The case of missing twins.

876
01:07:46,866 --> 01:07:50,233
AIR B347 to Smart Earth.

877
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:53,100
Departing in 30 minutes.

878
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,933
Please move to Gate #3 to board.

879
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:32,433
(Smart Earth, 2037)

880
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,433
(Marked 5,001st day without crime)

881
01:09:08,066 --> 01:09:11,100
And solve that case, too.

882
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:13,533
The case of missing twins.

883
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:18,400
I'm sure the answer
lies in Smart Earth.

884
01:09:21,466 --> 01:09:23,533
Find your brother.

885
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:41,633
I'm finally here. Just wait.

886
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:44,866
Wherever you are, I'll find you.

887
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:21,766
(Circle : Two Worlds Connected)

888
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:22,866
That woman from 10 years ago.

889
01:10:22,933 --> 01:10:24,566
I lost that alien
right in front of my eyes.

890
01:10:24,633 --> 01:10:27,166
No. That's ridiculous.
She just looks like it.

891
01:10:27,233 --> 01:10:28,000
Aren't you doing your assignment?

892
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:29,300
That woman took my dad away.

893
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:30,566
So what?

894
01:10:30,633 --> 01:10:32,266
Those who got caught for
swaying the stun gun.

895
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:33,300
I think this is the right guy.

896
01:10:33,366 --> 01:10:36,766
You must forget painful memories
to get away with it.

897
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:39,566
Even bad memories are part of life.
Should we make them forget?

898
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:42,600
Woo-jin, I think I found it.
Blue Bird is the culprit.

899
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,800
Please just come home.

900
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,533
I'm sorry, Woo-jin.

901
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:46,633
Entering or not,
we can't even reach him.

902
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:47,933
What are you?

903
01:10:48,033 --> 01:10:50,533
Why did crime take place
in Smart Earth?

904
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,400
You brought a bomb
into Smart Earth.

905
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:55,200
Kim Min-ji recovered
her lost memories.

906
01:10:55,266 --> 01:10:58,200
Does engraving of numbers mean
that this is not the end?

907
01:10:58,266 --> 01:10:59,200
What about the opening of the lid?

908
01:10:59,266 --> 01:11:00,300
We located Kim Min-ji.

909
01:11:00,366 --> 01:11:01,200
Where is Kim Min-ji right now?

910
01:11:01,266 --> 01:11:02,033
Where is Kim Min-ji?

911
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,200
Wake up, you jerk.

912
01:11:03,266 --> 01:11:04,733
Shouldn't he take some actions?

913
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,366
Let's talk face to face,
President.

914
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:07,966
He doesn't talk to outsiders.

915
01:11:08,033 --> 01:11:09,833
We actually need to arrest him
instead of talking to him.

916
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,900
What are you?

917
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,900
Either you find Blue Bird,
or you hack into it.

918
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,033
Why did you come to Smart Earth?

919
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:18,966
What do you know about
Smart Earth?
