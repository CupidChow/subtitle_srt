1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 38

16
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,590
Your Excellency, it's not right.

17
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,230
What's wrong?

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,400
They're watching us outside.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,800
According to years of experience

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
in tracking and sneaking,

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,310
I can't be wrong.

22
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,630
It's the Shangjing Town of Beiqi.

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,080
It's their job

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,270
to watch us.

25
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,510
Your Excellency,

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,230
Guo Baokun was followed

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,190
when he left just now.

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,190
I'm afraid

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,230
Guo Baokun is exposed.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Of course he is.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,550
He jumped off the cart in public

32
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,360
and checked into an inn after wandering about the streets.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,080
If he hadn't been found out,

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
His Excellency Shen and the Embroidered Uniform Guards would be punished

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,470
for their failure in duty.

36
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Your Excellency, did you expect

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
Guo Baokun would fail to hide himself?

38
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,160
I asked him to go out on purpose

39
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,600
to distract Shen Zhong.

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,320
You want to use him

41
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,750
to divert attention from us.

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,390
Prison.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,550
The Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison.

44
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,600
The Embroidered Uniform Guards.

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,440
The Embroidered Uniform...

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,830
What can I do for you?

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,160
Can you tell me

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,000
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,470
Here is a pharmacy.

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,110
Are you feeling under the weather?

51
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,630
No. I'm well.

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,550
Can you tell me

53
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,160
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,600
Prison. Prison.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,520
A building where people are kept as a punishment.

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,160
This medicine helps reduce hysteria.

57
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,800
Sir, you can have it for free.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Take it home.

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
Did he ask people on the streets

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,030
about the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison?

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,390
Yes. He asked everyone he met.

62
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,800
He's really rampant.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,110
But don't worry.

64
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,960
The Embroidered Uniform Guards is well-known.

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,270
Nobody answered him.

66
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,270
He was ignored.

67
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,750
I didn't expect Fan Xian would

68
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,470
let such a guy...

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
Your Excellency.

70
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,750
Can you tell me

71
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,600
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
No idea.

73
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,390
No idea.

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,240
Can you tell me where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,520
I don't know.

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,240
Can you tell me

77
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,270
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

78
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,440
No idea.

79
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,630
Isn't he afraid of death?

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,390
Do you know

81
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,190
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

82
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,270
No. No. I don't.

83
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,160
No idea. No idea.

84
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,800
Does anyone know

85
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,390
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

86
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,880
He must be insane.

87
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,030
He must want to die.

88
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,760
Can you tell me where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

89
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,550
Go that way and pass through three intersections.

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,160
Then turn west. You'll find it.

91
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,830
Thank you.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,550
Your Excellency, shall we arrest him?

93
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,040
The Investigator's Office

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,550
couldn't send such a crap here.

95
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,920
Let's go to the inn.

96
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,440
Got it. Go to the inn.

97
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,510
Your Excellency,

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
our scouts are just around.

99
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,000
They didn't find Fan Xian going out.

100
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,270
Search the room!

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
What are you doing?

102
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,040
Do you even want to

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
search under bed?

104
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,270
Your Excellency,

105
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,640
did they vanish into thin air?

106
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,040
It fell off from above.

107
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
They left from the roof?

108
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,790
Dispatch my orders

109
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,830
to search for them

110
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,160
in the surroundings radiating from the inn.

111
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,760
Avoid catching people's eyes.

112
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,670
Got it.

113
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,790
It's such a lame trick.

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,880
The smarter a person is,

115
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,070
the more liable he's to be taken in.

116
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,440
Any inexperienced guy

117
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,270
would choose to

118
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,790
search under bed first.

119
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,790
Only a smart guy like Shen Zhong

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
would think too much

121
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,920
after noticing some details.

122
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,110
Search carefully. Don't be too worried.

123
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,350
Even if we fail to find them for a while,

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
it'll be difficult for them

125
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
to do anything big without support.

126
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,670
Also keep watch on that guy who asked about the prison,

127
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,920
in case

128
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,950
Fan Xian does exactly the opposite

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,790
and plays dumb to make trouble.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,640
You're really thoughtful.

131
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
It's admiring.

132
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,110
Your Excellency,

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,920
we shook them off for the time being.

134
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,230
But where should we start to find him?

135
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,640
What shall we do next?

136
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,110
Let's go.

137
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,350
What are we going to do?

138
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,510
To see someone.

139
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,760
How did you know this place?

140
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,160
Who wrote it?

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,670
Does anyone in this imperial palace

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,440
work for the Investigator's Office?

143
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
On the way.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,510
Huh?

145
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,480
Which way?

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,440
Why did I keep the flag alone

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,270
to provoke them?

148
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,830
To gain face.

149
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
It makes sense,

150
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,160
but what's more important,

151
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,640
I came to Beiqi

152
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,920
to reactivate the spy network,

153
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,950
but secret agents are in hiding,

154
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,350
and I know nothing about their whereabouts.

155
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,200
I'd rather let them know I'm here

156
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,350
than look for them

157
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,160
one by one.

158
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,350
That's why you decided to make a big deal out of it

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,200
and catch people's eyes.

160
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,070
I see

161
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,440
why we're here with the banner of the border troops.

162
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
That is,

163
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,790
even if Shen Zhong

164
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,230
didn't make things difficult for us,

165
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,790
you've decided to

166
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,830
make trouble.

167
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,320
When you can't find people you need in thick fog,

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,230
make yourself a beacon to attract them.

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,390
Who gave you the address?

170
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,950
Why didn't I find it?

171
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,670
He Daoren?

172
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,880
I've found out

173
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,670
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is.

174
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,840
You have strong vitality Qi, but you're not skilled enough.

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,230
I can kill you if we fight now.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
Try it.

177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,590
Chen Pingping asked me

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,550
to give you a hand when you're in Shangjing.

179
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,320
How will you prove your identity?

180
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
It is the stamp of the Investigator's Office.

181
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,350
The wood pattern is specially made.

182
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,400
An outsider couldn't figure it out.

183
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,230
Keep it.

184
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,880
I only promised Chen Pingping

185
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,710
that I'd help you this time.

186
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,520
It's of no use to me in the future.

187
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
Your disciple Cheng Jushu

188
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,110
was killed by me.

189
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,280
I have a lot of disciples.

190
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,520
What would Chen Pingping do for you in return?

191
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,320
None of your business.

192
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,590
How will you help me?

193
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,550
I won't take action

194
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,000
or fight for you.

195
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,550
I won't expose my identity rashly.

196
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,590
I'll just convey information.

197
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,550
About what?

198
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,840
About the branch of Neiku in Shangjing.

199
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,550
What do I need to do?

200
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,880
Chen Pingping said

201
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,960
you're going to

202
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,790
take over Neiku.

203
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,470
You can take the chance to look through the account book

204
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,150
and get familiar with the branch.

205
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,910
I'm under close watch.

206
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,550
It doesn't matter.

207
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,550
Both government officials and common people here

208
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,400
know that

209
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
it's the branch of Nanqing's Neiku.

210
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,030
They all know?

211
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,590
But it's not closed down?

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,910
It's about commerce and trade. It's the source of wealth.

213
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,590
Relevant parties all benefit from it.

214
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,400
Nobody hates to make money.

215
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Even the Embroidered Uniform Guards let it go?

216
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,880
It's the Embroidered Uniform Guards

217
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
that does business with Neiku.

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,230
Princess Royal even did business

219
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,910
with them.

220
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,960
Who do you work for in Shangjing?

221
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,910
I'm a follower of the Empress Dowager.

222
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,790
Do you know

223
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,200
where Yan Bingyun is imprisoned?

224
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,520
No.

225
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,230
He was imprisoned by Shen Zhong personally.

226
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,760
Few people know the exact location.

227
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,230
Do you know where the other secret agents

228
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,470
of the Investigator's Office are?

229
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,880
No.

230
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,110
I have to tell you something.

231
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,960
I promised Chen Pingping I'd help you this time,

232
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,790
but it doesn't mean

233
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,880
I work for the Investigator's Office.

234
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,230
Do you know

235
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,550
the last place Yan Bingyun went

236
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,440
before he was arrested?

237
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,350
Well.

238
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,150
Yes.

239
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,710
I wonder how Head Chen

240
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,670
managed to let

241
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,440
the Ninth Dan swordsman of Beiqi

242
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,550
work for him.

243
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,150
We're pressed for time.

244
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,280
Let's act separately.

245
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,910
I'll go to Yan Bingyun's former residence

246
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,400
and you go to Neiku's branch

247
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
to get an account book.

248
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,230
Do you want to

249
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,320
find some clues

250
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
at Yan Bingyun's residence?

251
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,110
Some traces must've been left

252
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
if he stayed there.

253
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,080
We can find out some secrets

254
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,880
from the layout of his room

255
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,550
and arrangement of furniture.

256
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,030
Your Excellency, be careful.

257
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,880
Let's go there next time.

258
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,960
Okay. Take care.

259
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,880
See you.

260
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,880
Boss, a cup of hot tea!

261
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,640
Okay!

262
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,910
I'm from the south.

263
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,590
Since you disappeared,

264
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,400
I've been thinking

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,320
where I'd go

266
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,840
if I were you.

267
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,710
In the final analysis,

268
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,840
what you want to do most

269
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,400
is to find Yan Bingyun.

270
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,280
Where should you go to look for him?

271
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,030
If I were you,

272
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,110
I'd go to

273
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,520
where he used to live

274
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,400
and see if there are any clues.

275
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,200
So, I decided to wait here.

276
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,150
As expected, you came here.

277
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Only me.

278
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,880
You won't arrest me?

279
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,670
It's unnecessary.

280
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,230
The next day when Yan Bingyun was arrested,

281
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,880
I got everything

282
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,910
moved from this place

283
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,590
to the Embroidered Uniform Guards

284
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,840
and dismantled.

285
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,350
Each and every tile on the roof

286
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,080
has been changed.

287
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,670
Each and every brick on the ground

288
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,280
has been turned over.

289
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,000
What did you find?

290
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,110
Nothing.

291
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,030
He hid nothing.

292
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,400
You must've been tired to do that.

293
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,080
It's official business.

294
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,670
I have to try my best.

295
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,640
Your Excellency Fan, I'll wait for you outside.

296
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,030
Search it carefully.

297
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Take your time.

298
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,960
I hope you can find something useful.

299
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,520
So fast? Don't you want to search again?

300
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,670
I don't think

301
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,710
there would be any omissions

302
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,670
now that you've had it searched.

303
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,840
Your Excellency Fan,

304
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,440
you'd better give up.

305
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,470
Here is Shangjing.

306
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,230
Without support,

307
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,520
you couldn't do anything here.

308
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,910
But I still want to have a try.

309
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,790
Shangjing is a big city.

310
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,670
Many people went into the depths of streets

311
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,280
and then disappeared forever.

312
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm not bragging.

313
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,440
Nobody could stop me

314
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,400
unless he's achieved Ninth Dan.

315
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,710
Your Excellency,

316
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,280
after Fan Xian and Wang Qinian

317
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,840
went back to the residence,

318
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
they didn't go out any more.

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,960
We've found out

320
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,110
what Wang Qinian did earlier.

321
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,910
He went to the branch of Nanqing's Neiku

322
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,470
and took an account book back.

323
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,590
Your Excellency.

324
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,910
Please.

325
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,790
In my opinion,

326
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,080
Fan Xian is going to take over Neiku.

327
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,710
They took an account book back

328
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,520
probably to prepare for the future.

329
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,440
He won't give up on Yan Bingyun.

330
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,400
Don't worry. It's like searching for a needle in a haystack.

331
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,590
We'd better be careful, just in case.

332
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,550
Your Excellency, you can trust me.

333
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,150
I've increased secret sentries.

334
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,520
Fan Xian reminded me of something today.

335
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,230
He has superb martial arts skill.

336
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
We need a Ninth Dan martial arts master

337
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,030
to keep an eye on him.

338
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,350
There is no Ninth Dan martial arts master

339
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,030
available in the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

340
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,280
It's okay. We can borrow one.

341
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,200
Huh?

342
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,440
There he is.

343
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,560
Mr. He.

344
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,310
Mr. He,

345
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,350
I asked the Empress Dowager to send you here

346
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,710
because I hope you can

347
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,640
keep someone under watch.

348
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,880
Who is it?

349
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,800
Fan Xian from Nanqing.

350
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,000
You asked me to keep an eye on Fan Xian?

351
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,110
I know you're overqualified,

352
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,160
but you're the most suitable person.

353
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,000
Shen Zhong is right.

354
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,280
You're the most suitable person.

355
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,280
You're lucky.

356
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,230
It's not about luck.

357
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,680
I said some words during the day

358
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,920
to remind him of it on purpose.

359
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,160
There are so many Ninth Dan martial arts masters in Shangjing.

360
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,470
How did you know he'd come to me?

361
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,190
There are few

362
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,230
Ninth Dan martial arts masters here.

363
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,110
You, Shangshan Hu and Haitang Duoduo.

364
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,760
It couldn't be the Saintess.

365
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,190
Shangshan Hu is anxious

366
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,760
to take Shen Zhong by the throat.

367
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,190
You're the only choice.

368
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,590
Your disciple was killed by me

369
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,350
and both of you work for the Empress Dowager of Beiqi.

370
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,430
Of course he'd turn to you.

371
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Did you get the account book so easily?

372
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,710
Yes, Your Excellency.

373
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,470
Without any twists and turns.

374
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,880
We couldn't find anything wrong like this.

375
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,470
Let's take it back

376
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,920
and compare it with what's recorded in the Investigator's Office.

377
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,640
Then we'll know if anything goes wrong.

378
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,560
It'll be pretty soon.

379
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,070
When we find Yan Bingyun

380
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,070
and the birthday ceremony is held,

381
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,000
we can go back.

382
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,350
I don't think Shen Zhong

383
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,230
would set him free easily.

384
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,230
That's why I have to look for him myself.

385
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,190
You couldn't find him.

386
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
Actually,

387
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,190
I've got an idea of how to find him.

388
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,190
Your Excellency, did you find any clue

389
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,280
in his former residence?

390
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,350
No.

391
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,950
It was cleaned out.

392
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,950
But Shen Zhong doesn't know

393
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,350
what I want to find

394
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,000
is not in that house.

395
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,310
What do you mean?

396
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,310
The Embroidered Uniform Guards

397
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,070
can empty a house,

398
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,070
but they can't kill

399
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,310
all residents in the street.

400
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,590
I drank tea with some local people

401
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,350
and chatted with them

402
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,680
near that house today.

403
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,400
Sir, why are you sighing in despair?

404
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,710
I came here for my relative,

405
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,190
but I was driven out.

406
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,160
Really?

407
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,350
Men's feelings are changeable.

408
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,430
What will you do next?

409
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,680
I don't know.

410
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,520
I have to rent a house

411
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,430
and settle down.

412
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm going to turn to a broker.

413
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,190
You're lucky.

414
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,040
It happens that house is available.

415
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,710
Has it always been vacant?

416
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,710
Nah. Someone once lived there.

417
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,470
Something happened to him.

418
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,760
Who lived there?

419
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,710
What happened?

420
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,880
A young man lived there.

421
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,800
He associated with

422
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
either high ranking officials

423
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
or the rich.

424
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,040
Later, a girl came to his house.

425
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,400
After coming to Shangjing,

426
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Yan Bingyun asked others

427
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,640
to call him Mr. Yun.

428
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,000
It's said he spent money like water

429
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,280
and made a lot of friends.

430
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,680
There were lots of visitors.

431
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,560
He just took the opportunity

432
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
to collect military information.

433
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,520
When he was arrested,

434
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,350
it was some big guys dressed in plain clothes

435
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,190
that took him away.

436
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,400
They are secret agents of the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

437
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,350
The common people like to watch the scene of bustle most.

438
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,920
When he was taken away,

439
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,070
lots of people watched from distance.

440
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,520
Nowadays, this issue

441
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,760
has become a topic of conversation.

442
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,680
Did someone follow them all the way

443
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,560
and happen to find

444
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,470
where Yan Bingyun was imprisoned?

445
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,520
Of course not.

446
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,160
They're not that curious.

447
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,190
Then what's the point of knowing this?

448
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,920
It's said that

449
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,190
he's romantic and wealthy.

450
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,920
He also got to know a good girl.

451
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,640
Is that all you found out?

452
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,640
What's more,

453
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,520
the same day when he was arrested,

454
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,950
that girl came in advance

455
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,590
to ask him to run away.

456
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,190
When those big guys arrived,

457
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,040
she became a weeping beauty

458
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,800
beating and kicking them.

459
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,280
But owing to their strength in numbers,

460
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,590
Yan Bingyun was taken away, anyway.

461
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,560
Songs and dramas

462
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,070
are full of such stories.

463
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,680
It's nobody but Yan Bingyun that was caught.

464
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,350
It's nobody but the Embroidered Uniform Guards that caught him.

465
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,590
How did that girl

466
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,760
know about it before hand

467
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,160
to ask him to run away?

468
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,110
She beat and kicked the Embroidered Uniform Guards

469
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,830
when they arrived.

470
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,880
People turn pale even at the mention
of the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

471
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,280
How did the girl dare do that?

472
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,710
Why didn't those guys hit back?

473
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,470
Something is wrong with that girl.

474
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,310
Is there any young girl

475
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,310
in the Embroidered Uniform Guards?

476
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,400
Definitely not.

477
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,430
Then it's weird.

478
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,590
How did that girl know

479
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,160
Yan Bingyun would be arrested that day?

480
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,190
Why did those secret agents dare to do nothing to her?

481
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,680
You must've got an answer.

482
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
Does Shen Zhong have a daughter?

483
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,350
No.

484
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,680
He's not married.

485
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,350
But he has a younger sister.

486
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,230
How are they getting along with each other?

487
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,350
Their parents died early.

488
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,920
His sister is much younger than him.

489
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,520
She was brought up by him.

490
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,310
To his sister,

491
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,880
he's an elder brother and a father.

492
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,830
I want to see her.

493
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,560
You're kept under close watch

494
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,950
by the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

495
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,310
Even if I let you go,

496
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,040
you would be tailed after by them.

497
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,710
You can reason things out.

498
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,190
Reason things out?

499
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,520
Your Excellency,

500
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,040
Mr. He sent a message.

501
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,160
He asked you to

502
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,280
withdraw those secret agents around the mission.

503
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,950
Why?

504
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,830
He said

505
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,710
the guy who stays with Fan Xian

506
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,830
is called Wang Qinian

507
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,310
and he's a tracking expert of Nanqing.

508
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,800
Common secret agents

509
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,230
are easily found out by him.

510
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,310
That explains why Fan Xian

511
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,710
shook them off during the day.

512
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,590
Mr. He said

513
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,800
we can withdraw those secret agents

514
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,950
and he'll tail after them.

515
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,520
Let them go out?

516
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,230
Exactly.

517
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,950
If there is anyone from the Investigator's Office

518
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,880
who makes contact with Fan Xian,

519
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,190
we can catch the whole lot in an action.

520
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,310
Sounds reasonable.

521
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,880
Shall I withdraw them?

522
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,470
Check Wang Qinian out.

523
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,190
If it's true,

524
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,760
do as He Daoren said.

525
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,070
Got it.

526
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,400
Your Excellency.

527
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,070
Is everything prepared?

528
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,680
Which one do you mean?

529
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,830
All messages about Beiqi

530
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,590
sent by Yan Bingyun

531
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,070
before he was arrested.

532
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,350
Head Chen wants to present them

533
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,160
to His Majesty.

534
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,040
The sooner the better.

535
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,800
Got it.

536
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,830
Your Excellency, it's prepared.

537
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,040
Have you got it?

538
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,590
Yan Bingyun took advantage of Shen Zhong's younger sister

539
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,110
to hide his real identity.

540
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,640
Judging from the details,

541
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,400
Shen Zhong's sister is well disposed

542
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,830
towards Yan Bingyun.

543
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,470
Do you have any information about her?

544
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm afraid it's not easy for Fan Xian

545
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,760
to be as efficient and experienced as you.

546
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,520
I'm old.

547
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,590
Yeah,

548
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,520
and you're more cunning.

549
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,070
Shall we use a messenger pigeon

550
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,070
to tell Fan Xian about it?

551
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,400
No. It's too late.

552
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,520
It seems that this girl

553
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,560
is the only clue that can help

554
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,520
Fan Xian find Yan Bingyun.

555
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,070
That is Shen Zhong's younger sister.

556
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,710
What will you do?

557
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,800
Kidnap her?

558
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,640
That's extreme.

559
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,590
Won't you follow her?

560
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,950
Wang Qinian is better at lightness skill.

561
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,310
Your Excellency,

562
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,880
the further south I went,

563
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,000
the more heavily guarded it is.

564
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm afraid I'd be found out if I continue,

565
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,110
so I came back.

566
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,560
The south of the city?

567
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,800
Did you see her get off?

568
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,560
No.

569
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,190
Do you think Lady Shen

570
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,400
is going to see Yan Bingyun?

571
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,310
It's hard to say.

572
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,560
Just a guess.

573
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Even if it's true, the south of the city is too big

574
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,070
to find him.

575
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,760
I found that

576
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,920
it's guarded loosely and then more closely.

577
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,160
Something must've been hidden inside.

578
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
I can't go in,

579
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,310
so I looked around

580
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,920
in the neighboring streets.

581
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,590
I found that the guards

582
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
mainly gather

583
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,310
in these four to five streets.

584
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,230
So, Yan Bingyun must've been

585
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,190
imprisoned somewhere inside.

586
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,230
Can you sneak in?

587
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,110
No. There are too many secret agents.

588
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,560
Once you show up,

589
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,230
Shen Zhong would know about it at once.

590
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,430
It's a large scope.

591
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,920
He can transfer Yan Bingyun to somewhere else anytime.

592
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,110
In the final analysis,

593
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,640
only the two of you

594
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,070
can't get it done.

595
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,590
Besides,

596
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,000
we're not sure if Lady Shen

597
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,710
is going to Yan Bingyun.

598
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,040
Let's keep waiting.

599
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,560
Waiting for what? She's left.

600
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,070
Let's wait for her to come back.

601
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,280
She cried.

602
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,190
There seems to be a blood stain on her sleeve.

603
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,710
Seems?

604
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,310
I can't see it clearly unless I get closer.

605
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,470
Here is Shen Zhong's mansion.

606
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,430
It's already risky

607
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,590
to stay here.

608
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,470
You'll be found out if you get closer.

609
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
He's right.

610
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,520
There are secret agents here.

611
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,230
Let's go.

612
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,190
Have a look at this.

613
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,190
This is

614
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,590
finished dosage formulation.

615
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,160
And this.

616
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,880
Take it home.

617
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
Okay. Thank you.

618
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,800
Knickknacks!

619
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,920
Rattle-drums!

620
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,830
Knickknacks!

621
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,830
Bric-a-brac!

622
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,920
Just some medicine for flesh wounds.

623
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,160
There is also cold cure.

624
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,470
I'm sixty percent sure it's Yan Bingyun.

625
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,040
How about keeping waiting

626
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,830
before making a decision?

627
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,760
You don't have much time.

628
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,800
Why not?

629
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,710
Langtao is on the way to Shangjing.

630
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,000
Who is Langtao?

631
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,190
Ku He's first disciple.

632
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,520
Haitang Duoduo's senior fellow apprentice?

633
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,430
Right.

634
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,160
He's more capable than Haitang.

635
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,920
He also works for the Empress Dowager.

636
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,310
Once he arrives,

637
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,950
I'm afraid he'll take the place of me

638
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
to keep watch on you.

639
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,800
What to do?

640
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,520
We're in the capital of Beiqi.

641
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
It's enough to be sixty percent sure.

642
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,070
Who are you?

643
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,430
Tell Lady Shen

644
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
to let the cart

645
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,110
stop at the second crossroad tomorrow

646
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,280
if she wants to save him.

647
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,430
Who on earth are you?

648
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,040
To save who? I don't understand.

649
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,160
Lady Shen knows well

650
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,920
what will happen to him

651
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,470
if it's delayed.

652
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,760
Wait!

653
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,880
There she is.

654
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,350
It doesn't stop.

655
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,160
What a waste of effort!

656
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,950
I'm going over.

657
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,950
Your Excellency, it's risky.

658
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,520
Time is not on our side.

659
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,760
Do as I said.

660
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,760
Be careful.

661
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,070
Report to Shen Zhong

662
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,280
as I told you.

663
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,950
=Lady Shen, younger sister of Shen Zhong=

664
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,420
=Lady Shen, younger sister of Shen Zhong=
Who are you?

665
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:22,760
Who are you?

666
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,920
Fan Xian.

667
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,880
The envoy of Nanqing?

668
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,280
Take me to see him.

669
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,520
Who?

670
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,160
I don't understand.

671
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,640
If you really don't,

672
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,830
you couldn't have stopped to wait for me.

673
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,430
You have to help me.

674
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,710
I want to save Yan Bingyun.

675
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,680
Why do I have to help you?

676
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,000
You're from Nanqing.

677
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,880
He's seriously injured, right?

678
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,950
I'm the only one who can save him.

679
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,950
An agreement has been achieved

680
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,950
between the two countries.

681
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,710
Yan Bingyun will go back to Nanqing sooner or later.

682
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,160
I just want to take him back a few days earlier.

683
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,400
So, you are not betraying your country.

684
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,520
Now that he'll be set free

685
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,110
a few days later,

686
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,950
why do I have to help you do it now?

687
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,920
Before he leaves,

688
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,520
the Embroidered Uniform Guards
is bound to torture him more severely.

689
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,630
Do you really have the heart to

690
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,390
see Yan Bingyun become disabled?

691
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,080
He's a secret agent of the enemy.

692
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,670
Why don't I have the heart?

693
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
Then why did you buy

694
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,520
the cold cure?

695
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,670
And the food.

696
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,840
You take food to him personally.

697
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,360
It's prepared by you.

698
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,040
If you don't believe me,

699
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,150
you can drive me out.

700
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,120
As long as you say it,

701
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,870
I'll leave immediately.

702
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,280
Your Excellency,

703
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,000
Yan Bingyun has said nothing.

704
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,080
Torture him more severely.

705
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,560
Just make sure he's not dead.

706
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,560
Got it.

707
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,230
Oh. Your Excellency.

708
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,430
Langtao

709
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,600
is arriving in Shangjing soon.

710
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,320
Once he arrives,

711
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,520
we couldn't fail

712
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,190
under any circumstances.

713
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,150
Got it.

714
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,630
Shouldn't you be tailing after Fan Xian?

715
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,120
He and Wang Qinian are gone.

716
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,560
What happened?

717
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,950
They slipped out of the residence today

718
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,150
and I tailed after them.

719
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,280
Unexpectedly, someone stopped me halfway.

720
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,950
Who is it?

721
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,080
He wore a mask. I can't tell.

722
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,280
He chased and fought me

723
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,080
and then ran away.

724
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,230
Fan Xian disappeared at that time.

725
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
You're a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

726
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,950
So is that guy.

727
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,040
Which style?

728
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,840
Not sure.

729
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,910
On the whole,

730
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,600
it's grand in scale and imposing.

731
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,560
Mr. He,

732
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,470
there are only a few Ninth Dan martial arts masters in Shangjing.

733
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,760
How could it be possible?

734
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,230
But he just appeared.

735
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,670
Impossible!

736
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,080
I don't think so.

737
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,150
Your Excellency,

738
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,190
there is no Ninth Dan martial arts master

739
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,320
available in Shangjing.

740
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,320
Shangshan Hu is also a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

741
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,150
Grand General?

742
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,120
These days,

743
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,670
Shangshan Hu has been looking for Xiao En

744
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,320
in public and in secret.

745
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,190
To save Xiao En,

746
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,120
he could cooperate with anyone.

747
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,230
Fan Xian colluded with Grand General?

748
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,120
Shangshan Hu's martial arts style

749
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,840
is to be grand in scale.

750
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,630
Do you think it is him?

751
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,710
I can't tell.

752
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,390
That's right.

753
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,230
He won't give the show away easily.

754
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,630
If he gets involved,

755
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,800
things will be more complicated.

756
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,950
Your Excellency,

757
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,520
let me go to his mansion and ask him about it.

758
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,430
Shut up!

759
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Be patient till we get hard evidence.

760
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,280
Got it.

761
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,470
I'm wondering

762
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,950
where Fan Xian would go

763
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,520
with his help.

764
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,040
We're almost there.

765
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,600
He's imprisoned

766
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,840
in an old house in the south of the city.

767
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,360
It was arranged by my brother.

768
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,800
How is he doing?

769
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,390
There are many wounds. And he caught a cold.

770
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,280
Oh.

771
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,670
What will you do?

772
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,150
When will you save him?

773
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,910
Just today.

774
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,470
Today? Tonight?

775
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,670
Now.

776
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,800
No way.

777
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,760
It's closely guarded.

778
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,670
You couldn't go in.

779
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,800
Tell them I'm your attendant.

780
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,230
I'm here to carry things for you.

781
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,560
They only allow me to go in alone.

782
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,470
I can't even take my servant girl

783
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,280
with me.

784
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,840
We're almost there.

785
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,360
You have to get off.

786
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,840
Take more helpers here to save him.

787
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,430
I don't have any other helper.

788
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,470
How can you save him in this case?

789
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,800
You have to help me.

790
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,430
I can't.

791
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,430
It's impossible to take you in.

792
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,600
It's not you that take me in.

793
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,870
It's me that take you in.

794
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,520
Fan Xian!

795
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
You all know me.

796
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,630
A hostage?

797
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,150
He's a formidable foe. How can you hold back?

798
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,230
You should've taken action at once.

799
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,150
Just ask him if he needs

800
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,040
your help.

801
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,760
Even if he's suspicious of you,

802
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
your offer will remove his doubts.

803
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,120
In that case, with eyes watching,

804
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,520
I can't give you a chance to run away.

805
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,560
He won't let you go with him.

806
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,840
Why not?

807
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,040
Whose cart is it

808
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,950
that the secret agents

809
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,870
let go so easily?

810
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,670
It's really...

811
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,910
Your Excellency,

812
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,870
the hostage is your sister.

813
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,150
We've already...

814
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Do you need me to go with you?

815
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,950
Just stay and take care of things here.

816
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,000
I'll get it done.

817
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,670
Your Excellency!

818
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,230
Don't come in. Stay outside.

819
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,470
Lady Shen did a good job.

820
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,430
She has a talent for playacting.

821
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,630
Yan Bingyun.

822
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,800
I'm Fan Xian.

823
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,230
You stopped me

824
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,080
on my way to the capital city from Danzhou.

825
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,280
Do you still remember?

826
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
=Yan Bingyun, member of the Fourth Division
of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=

827
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,760
Yes.

828
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,080
Give me the token for Director-General.

829
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
So you want to take it by force?

830
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,520
Give it to me!

831
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's a new wound.

832
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,190
Did they just torture you?

833
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,630
Thanks to your intelligence,

834
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,800
Nanqing gained a complete victory.

835
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,040
Beiqi sued for peace.

836
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,760
As the envoy of the mission,

837
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,120
I'm here to take you home.

838
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,280
You gave in to Beiqi?

839
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,630
Do you think I'm lying?

840
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,190
It's not a long time since you went to the capital city.

841
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,230
How could you become the envoy?

842
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,150
He's telling the truth.

843
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,190
He's here to save you.

844
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,870
Now that he's the envoy,

845
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,670
why did he come in by kidnapping you?

846
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,280
Shen Zhong wouldn't set you free.

847
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,390
So you came here yourself?

848
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,520
Shen Zhong is crafty.

849
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,150
How could he let you find me easily?

850
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,390
Come on.

851
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,560
I'm not stupider than him.

852
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,390
The spy network of Nanqing is hidden.

853
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,150
You plan to gain my trust

854
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,470
by saving me

855
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,120
and then catch the whole lot in an action

856
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,430
when I contact them

857
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,630
after going out.

858
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,430
Shen Zhong wants you to do that, right?

859
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,320
Are you suffering from persecution mania?

860
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,670
I've never heard of that.

861
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,760
As for how I got promoted

862
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,430
and how I became the envoy,

863
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,710
I'll explain it to you

864
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,190
when we go back.

865
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,760
Even if you're telling the truth,

866
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,000
tell me

867
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,430
how you'll get out of here.

868
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,150
Shen Zhong wouldn't

869
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,600
let me go easily.

870
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,040
I have a subordinate called Wang Qinian.

871
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,040
Wang Qinian?

872
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,560
The clerk of the First Division?

873
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,470
He's already

874
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,560
chosen to work for me.

875
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,870
Before I came here,

876
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,320
I asked him to seek help.

877
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,840
It's more ridiculous.

878
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,670
Here is Beiqi.

879
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,280
Who can you turn to?

880
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,460
In the river of history,

881
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,660
time goes round and round.

882
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,020
Memories about the former and present lives

883
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,900
join each other in an endless way.

884
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,500
In the long drunken Milky Way,

885
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,220
one season follows another in a flash,

886
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,420
and the wild geese are flying south.

887
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,340
I just can't give up

888
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,340
to be with you for my whole life.

889
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,620
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

890
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

891
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,300
Year after year in the wandering,

892
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,860
I count the remaining years.

893
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,060
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

894
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,620
even though we have ended up the destiny,

895
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,300
I never feel regretful.

896
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,260
In such a chaotic world,

897
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,020
I still miss you as ever.

898
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,660
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

899
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,380
With a gentle heart,

900
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,940
I cherish our remaining years.

901
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,780
Even though we have to go through

902
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,740
all the hardships along the journey,

903
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:27,060
you always stay by my side,

904
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,820
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

905
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,740
Year after year in the wandering,

906
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,100
I count the remaining years.

907
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,460
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

908
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,260
even though we end up the destiny,

909
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,700
I never feel regretful.

910
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,620
In such a chaotic world,

911
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,580
I still miss you as ever.

912
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,260
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

913
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,020
With a gentle heart,

914
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,420
I cherish our remaining years.

915
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,220
Even though we have to go through

916
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,380
all the hardships along the journey,

917
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:07,660
you always stay by my side.
