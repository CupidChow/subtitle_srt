1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,780
Episode 13

16
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,400
Fan Xian should be here soon.

17
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,720
Take it easy. I'm early.

18
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,270
I'll get another cup for you.

19
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,720
The cup cracked for no reason.

20
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,830
It's a bad omen.

21
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,110
This place looks familiar.

22
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,470
It's where you hit Guo Baokun.

23
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Then it's a memorable place.

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,670
Niulan Street.

25
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,160
Speaking of this,

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,110
you still owe me an ox.

27
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,960
I'll get you one when we go back to Danzhou.

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,630
Luckily, I went to Danzhou.

29
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,520
Luckily, I met you.

30
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,390
Or I don't know

31
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,080
when I could

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,030
see my wife and son,

33
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,270
let alone

34
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,030
getting rid of hatred.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,720
Fan Xian.

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,080
Thank you.

37
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,110
I'll throw up if you say the phrase again.

38
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,670
Cheng Jushu!

39
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,900
=Cheng Jushu, Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master of Beiqi=

40
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,350
Why are you in such a hurry?

41
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,040
Cheng Jushu showed up on Niulan Street.

42
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
He's fighting someone.

43
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,510
Cheng Jushu from Beiqi?

44
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,070
He's an Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master.

45
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,950
Who can be a match for him?

46
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,880
Are you alive?

47
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
You still owe me

48
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,790
a piece of land and an ox.

49
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,600
I won't die before you give them to me.

50
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,720
Did you use poisoned daggers?

51
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,320
Yeah.

52
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,720
That would be great.

53
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,200
You leave now.

54
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,110
Didn't you use poisoned daggers?

55
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,640
He's nobody but Cheng Jushu.

56
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,920
An Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master. He's invincible.

57
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm afraid he won't be hurt.

58
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,720
Let's go together.

59
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,270
Go!

60
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,110
How?

61
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,920
He's still alive.

62
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
He's lucky.

63
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,550
If my vitality Qi bursts,

64
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,790
he'll definitely die.

65
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,270
If I die,

66
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,110
take good care of Ruoruo.

67
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,480
Tell Wan'er

68
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,110
phthisis is curable

69
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
and she can find someone better than me.

70
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,920
Go to

71
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,950
tell her the crap yourself.

72
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,080
Teng Zijing!

73
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,400
Teng Zijing!

74
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,230
Your Excellency.

75
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,790
Your Excellency, wake up.

76
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,350
Your Excellency.

77
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,150
Your Excellency. Don't move.

78
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
Don't move until your wounds are inspected.

79
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,790
Our colleagues

80
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,280
will be here soon.

81
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,790
Wake him up.

82
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
He'll never wake up.

83
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,590
Your Excellency.

84
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,470
Your Excellency.

85
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,470
What did he say to you?

86
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,670
He's already dead

87
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,030
when I'm here.

88
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,080
You said

89
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,840
you'd only die for your family.

90
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,230
You said you'd run away

91
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,880
in case of danger.

92
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,760
Why did you break your words?

93
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,000
He's not dead.

94
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,640
Your Excellency.

95
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,230
Your Excellency.

96
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,840
Go away.

97
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,550
Step aside!

98
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,470
Your Excellency,

99
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,350
we won't find the one behind all this

100
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,030
and avenge Teng Zijing's death

101
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,840
if he dies.

102
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,150
Who will interrogate him?

103
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,400
The Investigator's Office.

104
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,470
Take Teng Zijing to the Fan mansion.

105
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, Your Excellency.

106
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,590
I will

107
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,150
go to the Investigator's Office for the result tomorrow.

108
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,400
Your Excellency, let me go back with you.

109
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,350
No.

110
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,110
No matter who it is,

111
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,470
I'll give them one more chance to kill me.

112
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,760
Why is he so seriously injured?

113
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,030
Yeah. Where is he going?

114
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,790
Brother, how are you feeling?

115
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,030
I'm good.

116
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,960
I've heard of it.

117
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,840
It's all in the past.

118
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,080
Send someone to tell Li Chengze

119
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,080
an accident has happened to me

120
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,400
and I can't make it today.

121
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,350
Ruoruo,

122
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,470
we're not going back to Danzhou.

123
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,710
I'm afraid it's bad news.

124
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,080
Cheng Jushu tried to assassinate Fan Xian

125
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,910
on Niulan Street.

126
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,590
What's the result?

127
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,200
Two female assassinators

128
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,590
and Fan Xian's guard were killed.

129
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,200
Is Cheng Jushu still alive?

130
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,400
He's taken away by the Investigator's Office.

131
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,400
They must want to find the one behind this.

132
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,710
Here is the capital city.

133
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,350
Who dared to do that here?

134
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,110
I'll be considered the most likely suspect.

135
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,520
Your Highness.

136
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,840
It's me that asked Fan Xian to be here

137
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,840
and he was attacked on his way.

138
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,470
Your Highness, let's go back.

139
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,440
This matter

140
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,320
may shock the whole city.

141
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,670
Luckily, Fan Xian is all right.

142
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,230
But, you're not shocked at all.

143
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,760
Your Highness, what do you mean?

144
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
I don't understand.

145
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,150
You're not surprised

146
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,080
when hearing about the assassination attempt.

147
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,470
Did you expect

148
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,910
it would happen?

149
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,320
What are you going to do?

150
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,710
I didn't mean it. Don't take it seriously.

151
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,520
How is it going?

152
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,430
Fan Xian

153
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,190
reset the broken bone in his arm

154
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,160
himself.

155
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
He didn't send for a doctor.

156
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,110
He's a real man.

157
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,190
Like this.

158
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,920
It's done.

159
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,430
He looks quite calm.

160
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,070
He doesn't cry or lose his temper.

161
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,430
I think he's okay.

162
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,920
He's holding back.

163
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,160
No. It has been put back into place.

164
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,070
Look.

165
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,680
He did it himself. It's done.

166
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,040
It's time for dinner.

167
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,400
Where is Ruoruo?

168
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,800
No idea.

169
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,000
He came back alone.

170
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,520
I don't know

171
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,350
where she has gone.

172
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,640
Ask your dad to come for dinner.

173
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,520
Cheng Jushu is in custody at the Investigator's Office.

174
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,190
Ruoruo

175
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,950
has been waiting at the gate

176
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
for the result.

177
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,880
Who do you think it might be?

178
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,280
Li Chengze is the most likely suspect.

179
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,710
It's he that

180
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,950
asked you to go to Joy Tsin House

181
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,640
and you have to pass through Niulan Street to get there.

182
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,040
If I were dead,

183
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,310
everyone would suspect him.

184
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,830
So, it's someone else.

185
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,190
I want to know

186
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
where the Crown Prince went

187
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,760
and what he did today.

188
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,310
You don't have the right

189
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,190
to ask about his whereabouts.

190
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,070
The one behind the scenes is still a mystery.

191
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,190
Don't act rashly.

192
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,800
I'm done.

193
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,280
I've heard of it.

194
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,640
I've heard it's a fierce battle.

195
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,710
I've been worried about you.

196
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,590
Teng Zijing

197
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,110
is dead.

198
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,310
He was your guard.

199
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
No, he wasn't.

200
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,310
He was an idiot.

201
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,070
Tell me his story.

202
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,040
Okay?

203
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I received a secret order

204
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,680
from the Investigator's Office to kill the traitor.

205
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,560
You're from the Investigator's Office.

206
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,160
Fan Xian,

207
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,590
I need a favor from you.

208
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,430
Please kill me.

209
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,310
The Investigator's Office has special file record

210
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,190
of all cases.

211
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,350
If you can bring me

212
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,070
my file which doesn't have much importance,

213
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,590
I'd give my life

214
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,350
to you.

215
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,590
I can give you a hand

216
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,520
no matter what you want to do.

217
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,400
Don't bother!

218
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,470
We're bound to each other by no ties.

219
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,590
You don't have to do anything for me!

220
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,560
Why did you help me?

221
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,830
I want to help my friend.

222
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,520
The capital city is not a safe place.

223
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,070
It's good for you to leave here earlier.

224
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,280
Or your families

225
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,470
will always worry about you.

226
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,560
You won't leave the capital city?

227
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,040
You are so stupid. If I leave here,

228
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,160
I'm afraid you can't survive

229
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,040
by yourself.

230
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,190
Then you'd better do a good job!

231
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,520
I'm afraid I can't.

232
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,710
I owe this life

233
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,880
to my family.

234
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,830
As to you,

235
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,430
when there's danger,

236
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,400
you should face it yourself.

237
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,190
I'll run away immediately.

238
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,760
You leave now.

239
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,000
Let's go together.

240
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,280
Go!

241
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,110
He told me

242
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,000
he'd run away

243
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
in case of danger.

244
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,110
Why did he lie to me?

245
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,110
He told you the answer.

246
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,920
You mentioned it just now.

247
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,800
He said it today.

248
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,350
If there is nobody

249
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,280
you would die for,

250
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,040
you'll be bored with life.

251
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,590
If there is nobody

252
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,400
you would die for,

253
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,110
you'll be bored with life.

254
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,880
He meant his family.

255
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,590
For him,

256
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,310
you're also family.

257
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,230
Yes.

258
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,000
Who tried to assassinate Fan Xian?

259
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,950
I'm ignorant sometimes,

260
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,640
but I'd never dare to do that.

261
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,470
I've been getting well along with Fan Xian.

262
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,680
I really have no reason to kill him.

263
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,560
Then who do you think it is?

264
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,160
The assassinators are warriors from Beiqi.

265
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,190
It may be their plot.

266
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,400
It makes sense.

267
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,760
But I don't understand

268
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,230
why they want to do that.

269
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,520
Are they also angry with Fan Xian

270
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,590
and anxious to avenge Guo Baokun's injuries?

271
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,470
I'd never do such a thing

272
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,350
for Guo Baokun.

273
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,110
I believe what you said,

274
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,640
but I really can't think of anyone else

275
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,710
who has a grudge against Fan Xian

276
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,950
in the capital city.

277
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,160
Chengze, do you know gossip is a fearful thing?

278
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,520
Do you think

279
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,520
murder is a solution to problems?

280
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,310
Of course not.

281
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,310
There are so many complicated things in the world.

282
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,800
How could they be solved by murder?

283
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,800
I agree.

284
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,470
I think murder is a solution to problems.

285
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,280
You can kill Fan Xian if he's in the way.

286
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,680
You can kill officials if they suspect you.

287
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,280
You can kill the whole staff of the Investigator's Office

288
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,520
if they make detailed inquires.

289
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
You can also kill me

290
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,280
if I'm suspicious.

291
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,800
Murder seems like a solution to problems,

292
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,400
but only the unpardonably wicked would turn to that.

293
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,000
I'd be destroyed by heaven and earth

294
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,560
if I meant to do that.

295
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,000
So would I.

296
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,230
Then stop sounding each other out.

297
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,880
How can you rule the world

298
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,400
if you aren't large-hearted enough?

299
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,400
You despised the national law

300
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,070
by acting in such a foolhardy manner.

301
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,040
You can leave.

302
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,110
Your Majesty,

303
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,190
here is a secret report from the Investigator's Office.

304
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,590
They want to set Cheng Jushu free?

305
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,680
Yes.

306
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,560
Did Fan Xian know that?

307
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,040
Not yet.

308
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Then tell him.

309
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,040
Thank you.

311
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,350
I must leave.

312
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,800
Where are you going?

313
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,430
Teng Zijing died because of me.

314
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,310
His wife and son

315
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,950
still don't know about that.

316
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,880
I have to tell them.

317
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,190
My Lady.

318
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,560
Lady Fan Ruoruo is here.

319
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Let her in.

320
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,880
Got it.

321
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,590
Brother, Cheng Jushu will be set free.

322
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,640
Your Excellency.

323
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,680
Where is Cheng Jushu?

324
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,560
In the dungeon.

325
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
Have you found out the one behind this?

326
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,110
He said nothing.

327
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,160
What will you do with him?

328
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,470
Your Excellency.

329
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,310
Answer me!

330
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,350
He'll be sent out of town.

331
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,190
And then?

332
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,160
He'll be set free.

333
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,070
Who made the decision?

334
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,310
Generally, when the Head is not in the capital city,

335
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,710
Mr. Zhu Ge,

336
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,710
director of the First Division,

337
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,830
will take care of all matters related.

338
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,560
Take me to him.

339
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,230
Your Excellency.

340
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,430
Take me to him!

341
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,310
Please follow me.

342
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,950
The Investigator's Office is divided into eight divisions,

343
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,110
each of which performs its own functions.

344
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,160
The First Division is responsible for

345
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,350
supervising officials in the capital city.

346
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,710
This is the most important unit.

347
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,800
Zhu Ge has followed the Head for years.

348
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,310
He's powerful and influential.

349
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,110
And he's particularly severe.

350
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,040
Right here.

351
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,830
Your Excellency,

352
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,070
please be cautious with your words and actions

353
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,230
when you see him.

354
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,430
Your Excellency,

355
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,950
Mr. Fan Xian, a disciple of Master Fei

356
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
and Director-General of the Investigator's Office,

357
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
wants to see you.

358
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm not available.

359
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,560
Be cautious with your words and actions.

360
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,310
Your Excellency.

361
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,760
Your Excellency.

362
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,160
You want to set Cheng Jushu free?

363
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
Among the eight directors of the Investigator's Office,

364
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,560
Fei Jie ranks third

365
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,740
as for his capabilities,

366
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,950
as for his capabilities,
=Zhu Ge, Director of the First Division=

367
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,780
=Zhu Ge, director of the First Division
of the Investigator's Office=

368
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,350
but I look down upon him most

369
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,310
as for the way he behaves.

370
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,880
He can't make a clear distinction
between public and private interests

371
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,280
or between the important and the less important.

372
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,400
As his disciple,

373
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,310
you'd better not follow him in this respect.

374
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,640
Why do you want to set Cheng Jushu free?

375
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,680
You just need to obey orders.

376
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,590
Don't ask unnecessary questions.

377
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,400
As Direction-General of the Investigator's Office,

378
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,310
I don't need to follow any of the eight directors.

379
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,040
I have the same seniority as you.

380
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,470
The token is not false, right?

381
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,230
Right.

382
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,760
Okay. Let me repeat it.

383
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,710
Why do you want to set Cheng Jushu free?

384
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,680
According to an urgent report from the Ministry of War,

385
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,710
there is an emergency deployment
of armies at the northern border.

386
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,830
A war may break out at any moment.

387
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,590
Nanqing has planning a war against Beiqi

388
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,920
for a long time,

389
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,920
but the timing of making war

390
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,590
has to be decided by us.

391
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,950
How is it related to Cheng Jushu?

392
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,920
Cheng Jushu is a martial arts master of Beiqi.

393
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,000
If he dies in the capital city,

394
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,880
it may give Beiqi an excuse.

395
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,590
The national plans will be destroyed

396
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,040
in case they attack us at this time.

397
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,000
In case?

398
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,760
That's why you made that decision?

399
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,350
One of Cheng Jushu's friends

400
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
is a general of Beiqi.

401
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,110
He promised

402
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,350
he'd provide us

403
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,520
with details about the deployment

404
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,470
of forces at the border

405
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,000
if we keep Cheng Jushu safe.

406
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,160
So, you did business with him.

407
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,640
No matter what we do,

408
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,680
we have to put the country's interests first.

409
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,710
But if we can only win at the
sacrifice of the innocent people,

410
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,400
then what's the meaning of it!

411
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,560
It's a matter concerning national safety.

412
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,310
It's not up to you.

413
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,430
A life for a life.

414
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,920
This is the law.

415
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,760
It's just a guard

416
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,160
that was killed.

417
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,470
Just a guard?

418
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,310
Your Excellency,

419
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,400
the stone tablet at the gate says

420
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,350
men are created equal

421
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,470
and there is neither lowliness nor nobleness,

422
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,590
on which the Investigator's Office is based.

423
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,110
A guard is also a man.

424
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,160
He's a father.

425
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,520
He's a husband.

426
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,590
He's the only one his family can depend on.

427
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,710
The victim is dead,

428
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,560
but the murderer will be set free.

429
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,280
Where is the national law?

430
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,880
Where is the justice?

431
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,350
It's already been decided.

432
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,190
There is no room for negotiation.

433
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,950
Guards!

434
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,880
Here.

435
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,880
Tell everyone

436
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,640
the First Division

437
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,000
is responsible for Cheng Jushu's case.

438
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,000
Nobody should hand him over to anyone else

439
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,520
even if he has the token for Director-General.

440
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,590
Yes.

441
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,110
You'd better give up that idea.

442
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,280
Go home and have a good rest.

443
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,310
Your Excellency,

444
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,310
don't you feel ashamed?

445
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,190
I'm leaving.

446
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,950
Does anyone believe

447
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,470
what it says?

448
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,080
Wang Qinian, answer me!

449
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,390
Does anyone believe what it says?

450
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,320
Your Excellency,

451
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,230
such being the case,

452
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
you've tried your best.

453
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,320
Fan!

454
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,710
His Highness and I want to say sorry.

455
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
If His Highness hadn't invited you

456
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,950
to go to Joy Tsin House,

457
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,950
such an accident couldn't have happened to you.

458
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,120
But Fan, please believe us.

459
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,230
His Highness

460
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,360
couldn't have tried to assassinate you.

461
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
Can you do me a favor?

462
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,670
Go ahead.

463
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,230
Get Cheng Jushu

464
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,470
out of the Investigator's Office

465
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,800
and kill him!

466
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,000
Fan,

467
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,870
His Highness could do that

468
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,950
if Cheng Jushu is locked in the Ministry of Penalty,

469
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,760
the Capital Garrison or the Prefecture of Capital City.

470
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,230
But he's in the Investigator's Office.

471
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,840
His Majesty has given orders

472
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,470
nobody is allowed to step in.

473
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,430
Even the Crown Prince doesn't have the right to meddle.

474
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,760
How about

475
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,520
compensating that guard's family

476
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,630
with a large amount of money?

477
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,120
If it were you,

478
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,230
how much can compensate

479
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,360
for the loss of your family?

480
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,230
I won't make things difficult for you.

481
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,560
So much for this.

482
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,560
Why are you following me?

483
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,150
Let me walk you home.

484
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Is there anyone in the capital city

485
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,080
who's not afraid of

486
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,040
the Investigator's Office?

487
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,280
None.

488
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,670
The Imperial Guards and the Capital Garrison

489
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,710
are in the control of the Investigation's Office.

490
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,520
The Prefecture of Capital City is afraid of them.

491
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,470
Members of the royal family
are not allowed to get involved.

492
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,430
All officers at court are worldly-wise and play safe.

493
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,430
Your token won't work

494
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,600
and your father is just

495
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,470
Assistant Minister of Revenue.

496
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,080
I've thought about

497
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,150
every possible way.

498
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,950
I'm afraid we can do nothing about it.

499
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,670
When will Cheng Jushu

500
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,520
be taken out of the Investigator's Office?

501
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,040
I think it's this afternoon.

502
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,560
Find out the exact time.

503
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,150
This is all I have with me right now.

504
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,560
I'll get more later.

505
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,320
Please go back and wait at home.

506
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,910
Thank you.

507
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,840
Your Excellency,

508
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,710
I'll get it done because you paid for it.

509
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,000
Don't thank me.

510
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:01,870
Mom.

511
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,710
Why did you stay up last night?

512
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,430
Why didn't you blow out the lamp?

513
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,080
Why hasn't my dad been back?

514
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,080
I think he's nice to me.

515
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,870
I'll call him dad more often.

516
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,840
He likes to hear that.

517
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,630
Okay.

518
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,600
I want to buy

519
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,560
candied haws

520
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,190
for my friend who lives in the box.

521
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,710
Ask your dad to come back early

522
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,000
if you see him.

523
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,600
I'll get candied haws

524
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,360
for my friend who lives in the box.

525
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,320
Um.

526
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,150
Fan Xian,

527
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,470
is it really okay to put the coffin

528
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,280
in the yard?

529
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,910
I'll send him back

530
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,670
when I get things done.

531
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,280
Get things done?

532
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,360
What things?

533
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,280
Why do you keep sharpening the dagger?

534
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
Brother, what can I do for you?

535
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,390
Just stay at home.

536
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,040
How is it going?

537
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,120
I've checked it out.

538
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,360
He'll be taken away

539
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,280
from the Investigator's Office in an hour.

540
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,430
He'll get out of town from the
North Gate and leaves by water.

541
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,840
Wait for me at home.

542
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,710
Brother.

543
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't like it.

544
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,630
I wish I could do something to help.

545
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,150
Go along this street

546
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,840
to be out of town from the North Gate.

547
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,870
There is a small forest before you arrive at the wharf.

548
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,710
It's the most suitable place

549
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,670
for you to kill Cheng Jushu.

550
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,320
A forest out of town?

551
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,670
Right. This is the only choice.

552
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,430
Find a way to distract the escorts.

553
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,150
Then kill Cheng Jushu while nobody else is around.

554
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,190
In this case, even if His Excellency knows

555
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,710
it's you that have done it,

556
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,000
he can do nothing

557
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,430
without strong evidence.

558
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,470
However, Cheng Jushu

559
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
is seriously injured,

560
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,080
but he's an Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master, anyway,

561
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,040
and you haven't made a recovery,

562
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,320
so, it's a little risky.

563
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,840
Your Excellency,

564
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,800
you have to go this way to be out of town.

565
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,560
Who said I'd do that?

566
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,950
The forest is the only place

567
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,760
where there won't be pedestrians.

568
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,080
Why do I have to avoid them?

569
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,470
Thank you for providing information.

570
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,710
From now on,

571
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,000
stop following me to avoid getting involved.

572
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,360
Your Excellency,

573
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,040
where are you going to do that?

574
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,430
As His Excellency said,

575
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,870
we'll keep you safe in Nanqing.

576
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,040
Don't forget to ask your friend

577
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,360
to collect information on deployment of forces

578
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,230
when you go back to Beiqi.

579
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,150
And, keep silent when you go out.

580
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Follow us out of town.

581
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,190
There is a boat at the wharf
and you'll go back to Beiqi by water.

582
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,190
Remember.

583
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,800
Never stop when you go out.

584
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,840
We'll get into trouble if you're found.

585
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,040
Got it?

586
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,670
Let's go.

587
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,870
It's weird.

588
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,040
Go.

589
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,320
-Go! -Go!

590
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,470
Go!

591
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,000
What are you looking at?

592
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,710
His Excellency said

593
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,710
you have no right

594
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,840
to meddle in this matter.

595
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,870
I'm not here to meddle.

596
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,280
I'm here to kill him.

597
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,950
Your Excellency.

598
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,280
We work for the Investigator's Office.

599
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,520
Someone asked me to kill you when nobody is around,

600
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,390
but I don't like it.

601
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,600
You're so cruel as to kill people in broad daylight.

602
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,080
What you did is unforgivable.

603
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,120
I'll kill you

604
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,760
in public!

605
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,600
Someone wants to do business with you,

606
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,600
but I don't.

607
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,710
They don't kill you for overall interests.

608
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,320
Let me do it!

609
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,950
Delay Fan Xian.

610
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,870
Follow me! Go!

611
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,600
Go!

612
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,040
I've made much progress

613
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,840
since my last battle with you.

614
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,390
You'll die today!

615
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,180
In the river of history,

616
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,380
time goes round and round.

617
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,740
Memories about the former and present lives

618
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,620
join each other in an endless way.

619
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,220
In the long drunken Milky Way,

620
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,940
one season follows another in a flash,

621
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,140
and the wild geese are flying south.

622
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,060
I just can't give up

623
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,060
to be with you for my whole life.

624
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,340
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

625
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

626
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,020
Year after year in the wandering,

627
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,580
I count the remaining years.

628
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,780
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

629
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,340
even though we have ended up the destiny,

630
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,020
I never feel regretful.

631
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,980
In such a chaotic world,

632
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,740
I still miss you as ever.

633
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,380
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

634
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,100
With a gentle heart,

635
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,660
I cherish our remaining years.

636
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,500
Even though we have to go through

637
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,460
all the hardships along the journey,

638
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:13,780
you always stay by my side,

639
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,540
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

640
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,460
Year after year in the wandering,

641
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,820
I count the remaining years.

642
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,180
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

643
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,980
even though we end up the destiny,

644
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,420
I never feel regretful.

645
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,340
In such a chaotic world,

646
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,300
I still miss you as ever.

647
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,980
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

648
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,740
With a gentle heart,

649
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,140
I cherish our remaining years.

650
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,940
Even though we have to go through

651
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,100
all the hardships along the journey,

652
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:54,380
you always stay by my side...
