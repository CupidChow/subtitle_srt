1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 6

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,440
Who is it?

17
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,510
The girl from the Ye's who likes messing around

18
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,160
from day to night.

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,630
I remember her now.

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,630
Is it the girl

21
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,590
who gave you two cases of diamonds and jewelries

22
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,360
every spring festival?

23
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,270
No, not her!

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,950
It's Ye Ling'er,

25
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,680
the daughter of Chief Guard of the capital city.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,160
Just send her away!

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,160
Ye Ling'er is not a big deal.

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,950
I feel like she has other companies.

29
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,550
Who else did you see?

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,870
It's the carriage from the Fan mansion.

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
I just saw Fan Ruoruo.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,400
The servant of the Fan mansion just said

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,630
they left together.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,030
So Fan Xian must be

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,030
on that carriage.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,240
Normally, Ye Ling'er

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,270
would ride a horse on her own.

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,030
How come she suddenly changes her habit

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
and takes a carriage instead?

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,080
Wait!

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,880
It's probably

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,960
the carriage of Princess Lin.

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
Do keep quiet!

44
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,910
Nobody can know that brother is not here.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,750
I'll get off to talk with him.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,520
You're coughing more seriously today.

47
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,080
You can't afford to catch a cold.

48
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,960
I'll ask him over.

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,600
Lady Ye,

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,190
long time no see.

51
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,390
How are you recently?

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,270
Lady Fan,

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm not here

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
to chit-chat with you today.

55
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,600
I heard that your brother in Danzhou

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,630
has arrived in the capital city recently.

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,750
I wonder if he's on that carriage right now.

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
Lady Ye,

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
why do you want to see my elder brother?

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,190
Young Mater Fan, Princess Lin would like

61
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,270
to see you.

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,240
Gosh!

63
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,600
It's really the carriage of Princess Lin.

64
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,000
We're in big trouble now.

65
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,660
=Investigator's Office=

66
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,670
Is he insane?

67
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,440
Quiet! Quiet!

68
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,160
Let's go! Let's go!

69
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,440
Ye Ling'er, don't be silly!

70
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,550
Distinguished as Princess Lin,

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,880
how can she meet my elder brother in private?

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Who's being silly? I'm...

73
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,720
Lady Ruoruo,

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,800
I want to talk with Mr. Fan.

75
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,270
Just a few words.

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,160
It won't take long.

77
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,600
Just put the curtain down.

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
You can't catch a cold.

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
To tell you the truth.

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,830
My brother caught a cold recently.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
And he's not recovered yet.

82
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,070
Why don't we go back early today

83
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,640
and talk another day?

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,350
Mr. Fan, I beg your pardon.

85
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,720
You're sick.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
I shouldn't interrupt you.

87
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,000
But I must talk to you face to face

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,230
to set things straight.

89
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,950
Only a few words. Please get off and talk with me.

90
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
Mr. Fan!

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,880
Sister asked me to keep quiet.

92
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,550
But if I do so,

93
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,390
they'll find out that Fan Xian is not here.

94
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,320
What if Fan Xian gets angry

95
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,230
and stops me from selling the books?

96
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,760
I can't lose

97
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,670
my money!

98
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,670
Your Highness?

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,160
Sorry to interrupt.

100
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,110
Whatever you want to say,

101
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,390
let's talk next time.

102
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,480
Just a few words. It won't take long.

103
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,230
It's not convenient now.

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,440
Not convenient?

105
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,920
I met a singing girl

106
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,270
when drinking

107
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,790
a moment ago.

108
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,000
Now

109
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,440
she's on my carriage.

110
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,390
Princess, how about coming to my mansion

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,110
for a detailed discussion later?

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,760
Fan Xian!

113
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,320
How dare you!

114
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,480
I'm gonna kick your ass!

115
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,270
Ye Ling'er!

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
My Lady, how come you coughed blood?

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,270
Sorry for the interruption.

118
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,040
Let's go!

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,550
Speak!

120
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,070
No?

121
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,390
Being tough, huh?

122
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,790
-Help! -Speak or not?

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,070
Still keep your mouth shut?!

124
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,320
Won't talk, huh?

125
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,070
Beat him!

126
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,670
We won't stop until you speak!

127
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,440
-Help! -Drag him up!

128
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,230
Speak or not?

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,000
So stubborn!

130
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,550
Speak!

131
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,640
You ask for this!

132
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,040
Help!

133
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,270
Speak or not?

134
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Send more men.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,760
It should be one hundred more than usual.

136
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,480
So awesome!

137
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,950
Of course!

138
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,600
Let me have a try!

139
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,320
Let's go.

140
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,830
Good! It's pretty heavy.

141
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,790
Of course!

142
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,000
So awesome!

143
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,480
Excuse me!

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Excuse me!

145
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
Excuse me!

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,160
I'm Director-General of the Investigator's Office,

147
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,510
and the student of Master Fei as well.

148
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,760
Will anyone talk to me?

149
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,510
The texture is correct.

150
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
The stamp is correct.

151
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,110
The pattern matches. It's real.

152
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,350
Director-General, nice to meet you.

153
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,950
Your Excellency!

154
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,830
Master Fei is not in the capital now.

155
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,070
I know.

156
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm here for a file.

157
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,790
D No. 534.

158
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,230
Your Excellency, please come with me.

159
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,030
Have you got the information?

160
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,350
Yes.

161
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,710
Word has spread to the entire street.

162
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,000
Fan Xian caused trouble the moment he went out.

163
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,550
He bickered with Guo Baokun,

164
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,520
the Imperial Compiler.

165
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,470
And he even beat someone.

166
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,320
Did he beat Guo Baokun?

167
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Not really.

168
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,230
He only beat the guard of the Guo family.

169
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,000
But it still shows that he's a hothead.

170
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,590
Don't forget what just happened.

171
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,760
How can he do such a nasty thing

172
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,550
with his sister on the carriage.

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,230
So improper!

174
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,110
My Lady, please don't be angry.

175
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,150
I'm not angry.

176
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
I think

177
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,150
there must be a trustworthy man

178
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,440
in the world.

179
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,400
I would rather die than marry a bad man.

180
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,320
Right, there's another message.

181
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,960
Prince Jing's son invited

182
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,710
Fan Xian over for a poetry gathering tomorrow.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,910
A poetry gathering?

184
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,960
Help! Help!

185
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
This...

186
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,960
Your Excellency, it's fine.

187
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,710
It's just a condemned prisoner

188
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,670
from the dungeon.

189
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,350
Your Excellency, this way, please.

190
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,440
Your Excellency,

191
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,230
this place is guarded by Clerk.

192
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,670
The files in the D section are not confidential.

193
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,150
Feel free to ask him for it.

194
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,320
Who's that?

195
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,960
Wang Qinian!

196
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,880
=Wang Qinian, Clerk of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=
Mr. Fan!

197
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,400
No!

198
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,590
You can leave. We'd like to talk in private.

199
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,710
Mr. Wang, all these files

200
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,400
are managed by you!

201
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,320
You're really something!

202
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,910
I'm just a clerk. It's no big deal.

203
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,110
Busy as you are,

204
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,960
how do you squeeze time to draw maps and sell books?

205
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,790
But you must be

206
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,440
exceptionally vigorous and resolute in work.

207
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,440
And you run

208
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,880
exceptionally fast.

209
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,710
Mr. Fan,

210
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,150
how can you enter

211
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,280
the Investigation's Office?

212
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,110
I've got a Director-General token here.

213
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,150
Check it for me.

214
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,590
I don't know whether it's true or not.

215
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,440
Your Excellency!

216
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,910
What are you doing?

217
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,280
I know that

218
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm morally defected.

219
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,000
Not only have I failed the masses,

220
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,000
but I've failed Your Majesty.

221
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,550
But I accumulate wealth in private

222
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,000
only because terrible things

223
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,790
have happened to our family.

224
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,400
I'm really helpless.

225
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,350
Just get up.

226
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,440
I didn't ask you to kneel down.

227
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,320
Your Excellency!

228
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,280
My wife

229
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,880
died early,

230
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,200
only to leave a daughter

231
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,080
in my care.

232
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,110
My daughter

233
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
also got an incurable disease.

234
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,320
Countless expensive medicines

235
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,000
were used,

236
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,080
but nothing worked.

237
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,000
Just a few days ago,

238
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,110
my daughter

239
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,590
also left me.

240
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,080
Your Excellency!

241
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,760
I've spent every penny

242
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
to treat my wife and daughter.

243
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,280
Now

244
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,840
I sell maps and books,

245
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,280
only to save money

246
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,840
to bury my daughter.

247
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,400
I see.

248
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,230
Just get up.

249
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,230
I'm so frightened.

250
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,590
I feel so ashamed.

251
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
Get up! Get up!

252
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,760
Come on!

253
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Well, Wang.

254
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,520
I ran into you wife

255
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,440
on the street a moment ago.

256
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,640
She asked you to buy vegetables only

257
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,590
when you go back.

258
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,640
She said your daughter

259
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,910
doesn't feel well after eating too much meat recently.

260
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,080
She can only eat vegetables for a few days.

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,710
She also mentioned that
your daughter caught a cold last night.

262
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,230
She asked you to buy
some medicine on your way home.

263
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,670
My sincere feelings must have moved the God,

264
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,840
so my wife and daughter

265
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,400
are brought back to life!

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,150
What else do you want to say?

267
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,840
Your Excellency, look!

268
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,550
The sugar-coated haws

269
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,080
are so red and beautifully shaped.

270
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,350
They're definitely yummy.

271
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,080
Only such sugar-coated haws

272
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,910
can match

273
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,640
a charming young man like you.

274
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,670
Just take it!

275
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,550
Thank you, Your Excellency!

276
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,230
Is it really worth it?

277
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,200
For only two taels of silver,

278
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,910
you actually cursed your wife and daughter to death.

279
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,470
They are in good health.

280
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,280
A few bad words won't hurt them.

281
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
You're so greedy.

282
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,150
Aren't you afraid it might ruin your reputation?

283
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,350
Your Excellency.

284
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,440
Reputation means nothing

285
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,150
to me.

286
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,230
Money, to me,

287
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,030
is more important than my life.

288
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,320
This is what I believe

289
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
all along.

290
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,150
You might actually

291
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,350
get along with my younger brother.

292
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,110
How about this?

293
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,790
You don't have to give me back the two taels of silver.

294
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,150
You are so generous.

295
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,110
But you must

296
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,000
stop selling books.

297
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,550
Because I'm going to sell books.

298
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,710
What do you say?

299
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,470
I'll do it.

300
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,710
OK. Let's get down to business.

301
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm here this time

302
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,470
for two things.

303
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,640
One is that

304
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,400
I want to see

305
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
File D No. 534.

306
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,400
Your Excellency.

307
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,470
This file is about

308
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,350
Teng Zijing of the Fourth Division.

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,910
You're actually good at your work.

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,910
But

311
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,960
Teng Zijing is dead.

312
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,710
I know.

313
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,000
I killed him.

314
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,880
Can I have the file now?

315
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,550
Your Excellency.

316
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,670
There are many files

317
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,840
in the D section.

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,670
It takes time

319
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
to find it.

320
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,080
How about this?

321
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,910
I'll find it first.

322
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,150
Then tomorrow,

323
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,080
I'll deliver it to your mansion in person.

324
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
Is it OK?

325
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,350
Fine.

326
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,320
Let's talk about the second thing.

327
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,080
Someone tried to assassinate me in Danzhou.

328
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,590
You must have heard about it.

329
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,760
Yes.

330
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,710
The secret order was faked.

331
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,280
Many people of the Fourth Division were
investigated and punished

332
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,840
because of it.

333
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,470
Who planned the whole thing to kill me?

334
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,590
The one who gave out the fake order has killed himself.

335
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,470
It was a scout of the Fourth Division.

336
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,470
What's his name? Where did he live?

337
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,550
Who did he usually contact?

338
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,470
Your Excellency.

339
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,080
This case

340
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,880
was supervised by the Head himself.

341
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,110
No one else can take part.

342
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,350
Please forgive me for not being helpful.

343
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,080
How about this?

344
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,320
I just need a name.

345
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,000
He is named Xu Yunzhang.

346
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,960
Remember to deliver

347
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,000
that file tomorrow.

348
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,320
I see.

349
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,590
Your Excellency only needs to

350
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,470
wait at home.

351
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,790
There's one more thing.

352
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,520
My teacher told me something.

353
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,320
When you arrive in the capital city,

354
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
do visit the Investigator's Office.

355
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,350
There's a stele there.

356
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,230
Have a look at it.

357
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
What stele?

358
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't you always want to know

359
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,230
things about your mother.

360
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,790
After seeing that stele,

361
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,880
you'll get to know her.

362
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,440
Where's the stele

363
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,520
he has mentioned?

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,790
There's only one stele here.

365
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,960
It's outside the front door.

366
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,310
Outside?

367
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,880
According to the Head,

368
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,230
the stele inscriptions show the original intention of

369
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,230
establishing the Investigator's Office.

370
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,070
OK. I'll check that out.

371
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,280
You can go back.

372
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,110
I hope that laws of Nanqing

373
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,280
are made for the common people.

374
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,590
The noble shall not be tolerated,

375
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,230
and the poor shall not be suppressed.

376
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,560
No people shall be wronged,

377
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,950
and no sin shall be imposed.

378
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Practice the law is like wielding a sword.

379
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,950
wipe out demons and monsters

380
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,470
without asking the God for help.

381
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,040
I hope that the people of Nanqing

382
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,190
seek truth,

383
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,280
know etiquette and remain kind.

384
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,310
Never measure success by wealth.

385
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,470
Never yield to power and influence.

386
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,920
Pity the weak and detest injustice.

387
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,430
Hold strong beliefs in difficult times.

388
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,000
Introspect often when no one's watching.

389
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,350
I hope there's no suppression

390
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,110
and constraint in the world.

391
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Anyone born to the world

392
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,470
has the right to live,

393
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,560
feel free

394
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,310
and be happy.

395
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,110
I hope that one day,

396
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,760
all man are born equal

397
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,040
with no distinction of nobleness and lowliness.

398
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,830
Guarding life

399
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,310
and pursuing light,

400
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,640
that's what I want.

401
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,920
However difficult it might be,

402
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,400
I'll move forward fearlessly.

403
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,160
Men are born equal.

404
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,760
Everyone is his own master.

405
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,830
You actually wanted to change an entire era.

406
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,590
What a grand aspiration!

407
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,760
What a difficult dream to pursue!

408
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,190
Today, I finally understand

409
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,430
why you were killed.

410
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,590
But I can't

411
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,560
inherit your dream.

412
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,760
I don't have the courage

413
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,230
to go against the world.

414
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,830
I just want to live my life.

415
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,520
I'm so sorry.

416
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,040
Your Majesty, we just got the information

417
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,280
that Fan Xian went to the Investigator's Office secretly.

418
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,070
He asked for a file

419
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,070
and inquired about

420
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,760
the real killer of the Danzhou assassination.

421
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,310
He asked for file D No. 534.

422
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,800
I had it copied and delivered.

423
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,350
It's the file of Teng Zijing.

424
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,040
He's a member of the Investigator's Office.

425
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,070
He assassinated Fan Xian in Danzhou,

426
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,230
but was killed by Fan Xian instead.

427
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,430
It's weird.

428
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,560
He's dead.

429
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,070
Why did Fan Xian ask for the file?

430
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,040
He's still alive.

431
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,710
But the Investigator's Office reported

432
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,190
he was killed in Danzhou.

433
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,160
He came back to the capital city with Fan Xian.

434
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,230
Your Majesty, you've already known it.

435
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,230
In that sense,

436
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,800
Fan Xian has lied to Your Majesty.

437
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,160
Most of the people

438
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,830
have lied to me.

439
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,950
Your Majesty, does that mean

440
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,880
you want to carry out a thorough investigation?

441
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,310
As long as one can get his work done,

442
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,920
it's OK for him to tell some lies.

443
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,680
Your Majesty,

444
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,950
you are too merciful!

445
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,710
Will Fan Xian attend the poetry gathering tomorrow?

446
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,760
Yes, he will.

447
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,880
What about Chengze?

448
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,190
Second Price did go to

449
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,310
the Yishi House.

450
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,640
What about the Eastern Palace?

451
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,000
He's been spreading the word about

452
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,230
how Fan Xian beat the guard
of the Guo family right on the street.

453
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,400
Good for him.

454
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,800
Your Highness!

455
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,160
=Guo Baokun, son of Guo Youzhi, Minister of the Board of Rites of Nanqing=
Fan Xian only beat a guard.

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Even if the word do spread,

457
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,520
he won't be declared guilty.

458
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,400
To him,

459
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,680
it's no big deal.

460
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,110
He won't be declared guilty,

461
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,400
but his morality will be questioned.

462
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
Even if the whole city

463
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,880
knows about his misconduct,

464
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,830
there will only be gossips.

465
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,560
Fan Xian just came to the capital city.

466
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,430
He has no connection or reputation.

467
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,710
But Wan'er,

468
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,230
though not announced publicly,

469
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,070
is the Prime Minister's daughter after all.

470
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,160
If she is married to a notorious trash

471
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,470
with no talent and morality,

472
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,310
how embarrassed

473
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,400
will the Prime Minister be!

474
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
Destroy him completely.

475
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,280
Your Highness, it's so brilliant!

476
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,310
It's my aunt's idea.

477
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,070
But to me,

478
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
it's a little bit rushed.

479
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,560
So you're not completely for it.

480
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,800
No need to feel struggled.

481
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,400
She wants to do me good.

482
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,920
Then,

483
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,710
let's see how the Prime Minister will deal with it.

484
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,590
In your opinion,

485
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,800
what will the Prime Minister do about the marriage?

486
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,880
He'll ask Your Majesty to take back your order.

487
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,800
Besides that,

488
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,560
he has no other option.

489
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,560
Your Majesty, the Prime Minister asks to see you.

490
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,400
Let him in!

491
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,950
Let the Prime Minister in!

492
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,190
Let the Prime Minister in!

493
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,800
=Lin Ruofu, the Prime Minister of Nanqing.=
Your Majesty, sorry to interrupt you.

494
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Prime Minister, please rise!

495
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,680
You've done a good job.

496
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,230
I dare not slack off
when it comes to the national affairs.

497
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,800
OK.

498
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,760
Do you have any other memorial?

499
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,000
No, I don't.

500
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Then find a sedan

501
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,400
to send the Prime Minister home.

502
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,280
Yes.

503
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,040
Wait!

504
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,710
Old and weak as I am,

505
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,350
I feel tired after walking a few steps.

506
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,040
May I ask for a cup of tea?

507
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,520
Take a seat.

508
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,430
Get him some tea.

509
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

510
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,350
Tea, please.

511
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,800
Eunuch Hou.

512
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,560
Don't you see the fire is about to go out?

513
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,560
Yes.

514
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,190
I just

515
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,110
got a secret report,

516
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,430
saying that Fan Xian

517
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,920
caused trouble again

518
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,160
in front of Yishi House.

519
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,760
He beat the guard of the Guo family.

520
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,950
Which Guo family?

521
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,310
Guo Youzhi's family.

522
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,880
I see.

523
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,110
Government officials and the common people

524
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,430
all think Fan Xian

525
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,920
as rude and immoral.

526
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,310
Prime Minister, what do you think?

527
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,950
Well.

528
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,470
I'm afraid it's wrong.

529
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,680
Why?

530
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,830
He's an ardent young man.

531
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,590
He might cause some trouble,

532
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,430
but it's no big deal.

533
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,000
I firmly believe that given time,

534
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,110
Fan Xian is sure to display his talent

535
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,590
and make a name in the capital city.

536
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,470
You really think so?

537
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,920
Your Majesty, I trust you.

538
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,000
You are the one

539
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,640
who approved their marriage.

540
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,560
Insightful as you are,

541
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,640
how can misjudge a man?

542
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,640
I heard that Fan Xian will
attend the poetry gathering

543
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,560
held in King Jing's mansion.

544
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,470
I firmly believe Your Majesty's judgment.

545
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,590
Fan Xian is sure to
make his name in the capital city

546
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,160
with his literary accomplishments.

547
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,590
I'm actually looking forward to it

548
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,280
after hearing your words.

549
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,070
Stay seated! Don't get up!

550
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,400
Prime Minister.

551
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Your Majesty, I've finished my tea.

552
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,230
And I've had enough rest.

553
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,430
Then feel free to leave.

554
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,190
I'll see myself out

555
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,310
if there's nothing else.

556
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,430
Escort the Prime Minister out.

557
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,880
Such a cunning fox!

558
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,310
Your Majesty, the Prime Minister has decided to

559
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,830
support Fan Xian, right?

560
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,160
What he just meant

561
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,400
is that

562
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,830
Fan Xian is picked by Your Majesty.

563
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,400
If he's really morally deficient,

564
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,110
then Your Majesty have picked the wrong man.

565
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,350
If the marriage needs to be cancelled,

566
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,230
then you have to bring it up.

567
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,230
He's pushing me!

568
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,110
I've made inquiries.

569
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,950
Fan Xian was never taught

570
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,350
by renowned masters in Danzhou.

571
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,760
Nor did he write any poems.

572
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,230
So the poetry gathering tomorrow

573
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,880
is a perfect chance to suppress him.

574
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,830
How can he

575
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,680
write anything marvelous

576
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,040
overnight?

577
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,880
Once we win the poetry gathering tomorrow,

578
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,190
we'll spread the word that

579
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,400
he's rude and dumb

580
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,470
with no morality or talent.

581
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,920
Self-dignified as the Prime Minister is,

582
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,640
he certainly won't marry Wan'er

583
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,040
to such a joke like him.

584
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,040
Your Highness, you're really resourceful!

585
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,710
However, you must defeat him

586
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,190
in the poetry gathering tomorrow.

587
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,710
Your Highness, I've studied poetry since childhood.

588
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,920
No need to worry.

589
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,040
Moreover, today, before the Yishi House,

590
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,520
I got acquainted with He Zongwei,

591
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,280
the famous poet in the capital city.

592
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll go with him tomorrow.

593
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,800
I'll make sure that Fan Xian is defeated

594
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,560
and ashamed.

595
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,950
I just don't get it.

596
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,350
He actually agreed to attend the poetry gathering.

597
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,830
Does he want to make a great coup?

598
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,400
I care nothing about the poetry gathering.

599
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,760
I mainly go there to see girls.

600
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,400
Girls?

601
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,190
I heard many female scholars

602
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,430
will attend the gathering.

603
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,880
That's true.

604
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,760
Many female scholars

605
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
do like to attend the poetry gathering.

606
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,110
Brother, which girl are you looking for?

607
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,310
My Lady Drumstick.

608
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,160
Drumstick?

609
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,470
Such a weird name.

610
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,950
It refers to a real drumstick.

611
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,310
Lend me a box.

612
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,230
Did you bring it back yesterday?

613
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,190
Yes. The same drumstick.

614
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,040
Why do you keep it?

615
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,920
It's a love token.

616
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
It stinks.

617
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,560
Brother.

618
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,400
Aren't you just back yesterday?

619
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,920
How come you're in love already?

620
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,110
And the token

621
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,280
is so

622
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,190
special.

623
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,920
Yesterday before I got back,

624
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,350
I went to the Qing Temple.

625
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,160
Why did you go there? It's not on your way home.

626
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,470
You should ask that driver.

627
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,190
How could I know?

628
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,040
Then what?

629
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,640
Then under the censer table

630
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,710
in the side palace hall of the Qing Temple,

631
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,430
I met her.

632
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,400
Under the censer table?

633
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,230
For me, I never believe in God.

634
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,350
If there really is a divine temple,

635
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,110
please do send down an envoy

636
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,350
to explain to me.

637
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,470
If you give me the answer,

638
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,590
I will do you the favor of

639
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,400
believing in you.

640
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,920
Who is she?

641
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,640
I forgot to ask her.

642
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,400
How come you forgot to ask
the most important thing?

643
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,000
I just forgot.

644
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,950
At first, I thought

645
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,520
maybe we're not meant for each other.

646
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,640
Just let it go.

647
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,310
But I can't.

648
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,640
Last night,

649
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,040
I dreamed of her several times.

650
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,280
Although we didn't talk much,

651
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,920
I just can't help thinking about her.

652
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,430
We must find her.

653
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,800
She might be at the poetry gathering tomorrow.

654
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,950
I have to go there.

655
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,950
I'll go with you tomorrow.

656
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,040
If she's there,

657
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,160
I'll ask her name for you.

658
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,560
If she's not there,

659
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,400
I'll visit all the mansions one by one.

660
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,520
I will definitely find her for you!

661
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,350
How are you

662
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,350
more anxious than I am?

663
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,310
Brother, you know what?

664
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,160
This is

665
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,520
what you called

666
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,110
romantic.

667
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,830
So it not only exists in stories,

668
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,710
but in real life as well.

669
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,760
We must find her!

670
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,920
Brother, but Your Majesty

671
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,160
has appointed a marriage for you.

672
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,590
Destiny is so marvelous.

673
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,880
Will it be possible that

674
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,000
Lady Drumstick

675
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,400
is actually Lin Wan'er?

676
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,800
Impossible.

677
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,830
Princess Lin is sick.

678
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,950
I heard she can't eat any meat or fish.

679
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,590
So she can't eat the drumstick

680
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,310
or go out for a trip.

681
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,310
What's wrong with her?

682
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,520
I've no idea.

683
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,680
It doesn't matter.

684
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,920
What matters now is to
find my Sister-in-law Drumstick.

685
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,190
Lady Drumstick sounds fine,

686
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,000
but Sister-in-law Drumstick

687
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,040
is not so good.

688
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,280
Well, I shall look for her right away!

689
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,640
Be patient! You've never seen her.

690
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,000
You won't recognize her even if you see her.

691
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,190
That's true.

692
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,640
I'm so envious of you.

693
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,190
You live your lives

694
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,000
as stories.

695
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,430
You'll meet your Mr. Right in future.

696
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,430
Me?

697
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,830
I won't! It's too hard for me!

698
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,310
In future, my marriage

699
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,190
is sure to be decided by dad.

700
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,040
Definitely not!

701
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,760
You must decide it yourself.

702
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,190
Life's short.

703
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,230
If you marry someone

704
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,000
you don't like,

705
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,710
what's the fun of it.

706
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,590
But for girls, marriage

707
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,470
is usually decided by parents.

708
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,400
I don't care about others.

709
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,470
You're different.

710
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,680
Ruoruo,

711
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,160
whoever you like,

712
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,350
I'll get him for you

713
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,400
no matter how hard it might be.

714
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,470
As to the rest of the family,

715
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,040
don't worry. I'll handle them.

716
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,190
Thank you, brother.

717
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,110
You're so kind to me.

718
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,470
Because I only have

719
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,920
one sister!

720
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,280
Well, where's Teng Zijing?

721
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,350
I need to talk with him.

722
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,800
What's wrong?

723
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,280
I forgot.

724
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,430
I waited for you here

725
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,760
to tell you something.

726
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,430
Teng Zijing was caught by dad

727
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,000
the moment he arrived at our mansion.

728
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,190
Now he's locked up in the backyard.

729
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,710
Why did dad catch him?

730
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,520
I don't know.

731
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,600
Also, Fan Sizhe is kneeling

732
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,120
in front of the study.

733
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,280
How is Fan Sizhe

734
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,120
involved in this?

735
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,840
Dad suspects that

736
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,000
he incited you

737
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,230
to fight with Guo Baokun,

738
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,840
so that you and the Crown Prince will be enemies.

739
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,840
Can Fan Sizhe

740
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,910
be so cunning?

741
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,560
He can't,

742
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,950
but his mother can.

743
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,230
It's a common scheme used

744
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,320
when competing for family properties.

745
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,230
Is there any evidence?

746
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,470
No.

747
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,390
OK. I see.

748
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,150
Just wait here.

749
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,080
I'll handle it.

750
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,560
Look at you!

751
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,630
One is caught, and the other is kneeling.

752
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,470
Why didn't you tell me first?

753
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,630
Your IQ is as low as a basin.

754
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,120
IQ... basin.

755
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,150
What is IQ, and what is a basin?

756
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,600
Does it hurt?

757
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,520
Get up.

758
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,910
Dad asked me to kneel. I dare not get up!

759
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,430
I'll talk to him.

760
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,430
What can you say?

761
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,870
Madam, Fan Xian is back.

762
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,760
Where is he?

763
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,230
He has gone to Master's study.

764
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,870
Madam, Young Master is still on his knees.

765
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,520
Just ask Master

766
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,430
for mercy.

767
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,320
Now, Fan Xian is the only one

768
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,910
who can save Sizhe.

769
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,280
Father.

770
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
Where have you been?

771
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,800
The Investigator's Office.

772
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,280
Why did you go there?

773
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,430
To see the stele left by my mom.

774
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,120
Did she say those words?

775
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,280
Yes.

776
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,230
That's the original intention of
establishing the Investigator's Office.

777
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,470
I can still remember

778
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,080
the look on her face when she said those words.

779
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,230
I've never heard of

780
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,710
such a great dream!

781
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,230
It's also unrealistic.

782
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,800
You mom wanted to change the whole world.

783
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,360
That stele is covered with dust.

784
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,520
It's been forgotten for a long time.

785
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,040
Well, forget it.

786
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
I'm here to ask you

787
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,630
why is Fan Sizhe kneeling outside.

788
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,040
Don't make a sound. Don't talk.

789
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,600
Don't ask me.

790
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,560
Mom, why are you here?

791
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,800
Prince Jing's son supports the second prince,

792
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,630
while Guo Baokun supports the Crown Prince.

793
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,600
You've told me

794
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,470
the second prince is also competing for the throne.

795
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,360
Exactly.

796
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,080
So the two

797
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,560
are incompatible as water and fire.

798
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,910
You fought with Guo Baokun

799
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,910
and will attend

800
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,600
the poetry gathering held by Prince Jing's son.

801
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,280
To others,

802
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,870
you've chosen to support the second prince.

803
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,710
It's a big deal.

804
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,080
The Crown Prince won't tolerate it.

805
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,040
Anyway, the Crown Prince won't like me.

806
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,000
Just let Fan Sizhe get up.

807
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,600
What a coincidence!

808
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,560
He took you to the Yishi House.

809
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,800
Then you got into a fight
with Guo Baokun right away.

810
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,430
And then Prince Jing's son showed up just in time.

811
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,120
I also find it coincidental.

812
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,710
So I suspect that

813
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,630
the Crown Prince and the second prince

814
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,670
had us followed all along.

815
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,360
It's also possible that

816
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,230
Fan Sizhe set the trap deliberately.

817
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,670
Impossible!

818
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,710
Fan Sizhe didn't

819
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,080
do this.

820
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,430
You really trust him?

821
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,470
The best idea

822
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,390
he could come up with is to beat me up.

823
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,320
He couldn't figure out

824
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,430
such a complicated trap.

825
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,910
What about his mother?

826
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,470
She's capable of that.

827
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,870
But father,

828
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,080
let's be honest.

829
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,870
If she comes up with such a sophisticated scheme,

830
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,560
will she send Fan Sizhe

831
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,470
to execute it?

832
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,470
No way.

833
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,390
I'm telling you!

834
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,670
If there's a banana hanging on the beam,

835
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,470
Fan Sizhe might not be able to

836
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,080
get it down.

837
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,320
Fine.

838
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,760
If you choose to believe him,

839
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,390
then he can get up.

840
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,950
You should apologize to him.

841
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,710
You put him on his knees for so long

842
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,630
with no evidence.

843
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,840
Don't you think

844
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
you're too hard on him?

845
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,950
He's disappointed me for so many times.

846
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,320
How?

847
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,360
He's neither adept with pen or the sword.

848
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,520
He idles about every day.

849
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,320
He's really good for nothing!

850
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,910
Fan Sizhe is money-mad indeed.

851
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,000
But have you ever wondered why?

852
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,630
Here you are.

853
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
I've asked Ruoruo about him.

854
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,280
He never indulged himself in

855
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,670
a dissipated life.

856
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,470
Then why is he money-mad?

857
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,040
Moreover,

858
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,470
he's good at something.

859
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,800
He's gifted in

860
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,470
business and financial accounting.

861
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,710
But

862
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,840
those are not the right ways.

863
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,280
Right or not, let's put that aside for now.

864
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,150
I'm asking

865
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,840
why is he

866
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,230
money-mad?

867
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,670
You know why?

868
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,320
Because you are the Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue,

869
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,080
who is in charge of the world wealth.

870
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,430
How is that relevant?

871
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,320
In the Yishi House,

872
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,360
at first Fan Sizhe

873
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,280
just bickered with others.

874
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,520
He didn't make a punch

875
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,760
until Guo Baokun said something disrespectful

876
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,190
about you.

877
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,390
In his heart,

878
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,390
he admires you the most.

879
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,390
Mom, what have you heard?

880
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,560
You are the Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue,

881
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,280
so he is obsessed with business.

882
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,710
He might not know himself that

883
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,600
he's made all the efforts

884
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,800
because he wants to help you

885
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
subconsciously.

886
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,670
The one kneeling outside

887
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
is your son.

888
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,560
You might find him useless.

889
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,560
But he's done everything

890
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,950
to gain

891
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,080
your appreciation.

892
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,390
You wronged him.

893
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,120
You owe him an apology.

894
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,910
Get up!

895
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,710
Me?

896
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,950
I'm OK. My legs are numb.

897
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,360
I've kept you on your knees for so long

898
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,080
out of no reason.

899
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,470
Do you wonder

900
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,390
why?

901
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,670
I must have done something

902
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,230
to upset you.

903
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
What do you want?

904
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,560
I can grant you a wish.

905
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,230
What do you want?

906
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,390
Really?

907
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
Anything?

908
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,710
Just say it.

909
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,600
Dad.

910
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,910
I want to

911
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,280
play Pai Gow with you.

912
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,560
Play Pai Gow?

913
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,600
Dad, we should play with money.

914
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,910
Fine. Wait for me in the hall.

915
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,230
OK.

916
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,840
There's one more thing.

917
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,360
You must release Teng Zijing.

918
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,950
He had a record

919
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,000
in the Ministry of Penalty

920
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,000
and he came back to the capital with you.

921
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,870
I'm afraid he's up to something.

922
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,190
He's my friend.

923
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
It's too extravagant

924
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,870
to have a friend in the capital city.

925
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,900
In the river of history,

926
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,100
time goes round and round.

927
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,460
Memories about the former and present lives

928
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,340
join each other in an endless way.

929
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,940
In the long drunken Milky Way,

930
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,660
one season follows another in a flash,

931
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,860
and the wild geese are flying south.

932
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,780
I just can't give up

933
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,780
to be with you for my whole life.

934
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:59,060
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

935
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

936
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,740
Year after year in the wandering,

937
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,300
I count the remaining years.

938
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,500
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

939
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,060
even though we have ended up the destiny,

940
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,740
I never feel regretful.

941
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,700
In such a chaotic world,

942
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,460
I still miss you as ever.

943
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,100
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

944
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,820
With a gentle heart,

945
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,380
I cherish our remaining years.

946
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,220
Even though we have to go through

947
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,180
all the hardships along the journey,

948
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:38,500
you always stay by my side,

949
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,260
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

950
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,180
Year after year in the wandering,

951
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,540
I count the remaining years.

952
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,900
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

953
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,700
even though we end up the destiny,

954
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,140
I never feel regretful.

955
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,060
In such a chaotic world,

956
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,020
I still miss you as ever.

957
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,700
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

958
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,460
With a gentle heart,

959
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,860
I cherish our remaining years.

960
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,660
Even though we have to go through

961
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,820
all the hardships along the journey,

962
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:19,100
you always stay by my side...
