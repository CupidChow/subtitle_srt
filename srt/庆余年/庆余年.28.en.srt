1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 28

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,510
That guy was shot with an arrow.

17
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,720
He must've been seriously injured.

18
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,360
The guards are looking for him.

19
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,590
So why are you here

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,230
instead of searching for him?

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm worried about Her Highness' safety.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,480
With me here, you have nothing to worry about.

23
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,760
He came here for my sake.

24
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,550
Your Highness.

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,630
Xiaoyi, can I beg you for something?

26
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,950
Your Highness,

27
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,550
please never say the word "beg".

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,830
Find that assassinator

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,800
and kill him.

30
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,720
You don't want to get more information from him?

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,750
I was having a talk

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,800
with Zhuang Mohan

33
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,470
and he saw it.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,670
Your Highness.

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,720
I made a deal with Zhuang Mohan

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,550
and told him Yan Bingyun is from

37
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,360
the Investigator's Office.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Did you get it?

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,360
Yes.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,670
If you want to do your bit

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,270
as an imperial guard,

42
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,240
you can report it to His Majesty now.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
I won't blame you.

44
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,800
You can do

45
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,080
whatever you like.

46
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,830
That year, my family was all killed

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,550
in that mountain village

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,550
and I was starving to death.

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,960
If you hadn't passed by and saved me,

50
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,830
I must have died.

51
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,960
I owe you a life.

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm ready to pay you back anytime.

53
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,960
I'll always stay by your side

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,080
and serve you

55
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,320
even if you're condemned

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,240
by everyone else someday.

57
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,630
Stand up.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,270
Your Highness.

59
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,440
Go ahead.

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,030
I think that guy is Fan Xian, judging from his figure.

61
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,320
Fan Xian?

62
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,630
He wore a mask. It's hard to tell.

63
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,550
But they're similar in figure and height.

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,630
In the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest,

65
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,910
Fan Xian joined the poetry contest and got drunk.

66
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,910
He was carried home.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,030
It couldn't be him.

68
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,880
Let's make a conclusion after having a look.

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,630
If he isn't at home right now,

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,240
it must be him.

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Go there now.

72
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,030
If anyone stops you,

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,750
tell them it's me that sent you there.

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Got it.

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,910
Your Highness,

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
why did you tell him

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,800
about Zhuang Mohan?

78
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,240
It's impossible to hide it from him.

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,110
You're all thumbs.

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,270
Be careful.

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,040
Don't spill

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,270
the porridge.

83
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,200
Honestly! Ruoruo.

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,000
Madam.

85
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,270
You're still here?

86
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,880
Yeah. I am.

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,830
How is it going with Fan Xian?

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,390
He... He's still sleeping.

89
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
I'll come in.

90
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,670
Is he sleeping?

91
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,920
Have you stayed up all night

92
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,720
to take care of him?

93
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,390
I'm good.

94
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,110
He drank too much

95
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,760
last night,

96
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,510
so I got up early

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,920
and made some porridge cooked for him.

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,950
Fan Xian...

99
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,390
He's still sleeping.

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,200
He caught a slight cold last night.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,510
I've got one more quilt for him.

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
And the medicine is being decocted.

103
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,000
He can take it when he wakes up.

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,040
Do you want to have a look at him?

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,320
Nah.

106
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,510
Let him sleep.

107
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,160
You'd better go back and have a rest.

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,880
I'll stay.

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm good.

110
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,720
I don't understand

111
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
some poems I read last night.

112
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,760
I want to ask him when he wakes up.

113
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,760
You...

114
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Madam.

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Keep it down.

116
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,320
There is something else

117
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,720
I need to take care of.

118
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,790
You...

119
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,550
Madam, please go ahead.

120
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,760
I'll leave you alone.

121
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,040
Someone wants to see Fan Xian so early in the morning?

122
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,830
Exactly.

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,640
Who is it?

124
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,350
Madam, it's him.

125
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,550
This is the backyard. Don't...

126
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,510
You can't break in.

127
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,480
I once saw you.

128
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,200
You're an imperial guard.

129
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,950
I'm Yan Xiaoyi, Director of Imperial Guards.

130
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,200
Let me pay my respect to you.

131
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,040
So,

132
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,760
are you here to search my house by His Majesty's order?

133
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,070
Of course not.

134
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,950
Princess Royal

135
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,270
asked me to see Fan Xian.

136
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,640
As you know,

137
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
it's better to get such matters done without delay.

138
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
But it's so early.

139
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,920
Why are you in such a hurry?

140
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,510
It's because Her Highness thinks highly of him.

141
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,230
Madam,

142
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,760
shall I wake His Lordship up?

143
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,550
I just want to make sure he's alright

144
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,230
and ask him a few questions.

145
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,480
Then I'll go back.

146
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,320
Don't bother.

147
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,830
Follow me.

148
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,880
Ruoruo.

149
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,230
Someone from the imperial palace

150
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,670
is here to visit Fan Xian.

151
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,440
Ruoruo?

152
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,510
Check if he's woken up.

153
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,390
This is Director Yan.

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,550
He's still sleeping.

155
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,760
I won't wake him up.

156
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,910
I'll just go inside and have a look at him.

157
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,910
Then my job will be done.

158
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,880
Please step slightly.

159
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,790
Lady Ruoruo, please step aside.

160
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,670
He's not well.

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,400
You'd better see him later.

162
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,350
Please forgive me.

163
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,440
Yan Xiaoyi, what are you doing?

164
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,150
I'm sorry, but I'm under orders to do that.

165
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,320
Here is the mansion of the Assistant
Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

166
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,760
Her Highness has no right to do that to an imperial officer.

167
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,590
Lady Ruoruo, what are you afraid of?

168
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,150
I have good hearing.

169
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,150
I don't think I can hear anyone breathing

170
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,760
in the room.

171
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Ruoruo.

172
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,000
Let him in.

173
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,840
Sorry.

174
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,320
I drank too much last night.

175
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,710
I have such a massive hangover that I can't get up.

176
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
Besides,

177
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm a sound sleeper

178
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,760
and I have quiet breathing.

179
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,350
Director Yan,

180
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,640
how about listening to it more carefully?

181
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,760
Do you mind leaving us alone?

182
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,110
Her Highness asked me to pass on a message to Fan Xian.

183
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
It's ridiculous!

184
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,080
It's okay.

185
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,590
Madam. Ruoruo.

186
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,880
Help me

187
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
withdraw the curtains.

188
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,790
I'll have a talk with Director Yan.

189
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,670
Please wait outside.

190
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,710
Madam.

191
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,910
Take off your clothes.

192
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,400
These guys

193
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,110
really need more discipline.

194
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,150
They're running wild.

195
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
Ruoruo, are you okay?

196
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,670
I'm good.

197
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,110
I'm not into that.

198
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,520
An assassinator sneaked into the palace.

199
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,400
Really?

200
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,550
Is it caught?

201
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,230
No.

202
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,440
It can be considered

203
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,590
your neglect of duty, right?

204
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,960
The assassinator was shot in the back of his waist.

205
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,280
He must be injured.

206
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,030
Show me your back.

207
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,590
Are you suspicious of me?

208
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,910
I believe it's you.

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,710
Do you have evidence?

210
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,550
No.

211
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,080
Are you doing that by His Majesty's order?

212
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,880
No.

213
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,640
Then why should I do as you said?

214
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,030
Are you afraid of being found out?

215
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,080
You pushed my sister

216
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,640
at the gate, right?

217
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,470
I'll say sorry to her later.

218
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,670
Kneel down and confess in front of her.

219
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,840
What?

220
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Let's make a bet.

221
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,230
I'll take off my clothes.

222
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,670
If I'm injured,

223
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,550
you can take me to the Ministry of Penalty,

224
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,640
the Supreme Court,

225
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,590
the Investigator's Office,

226
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
or any other place you want.

227
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,030
If I'm not injured,

228
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
you kneel down

229
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,790
and give a kowtow to Ruoruo.

230
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,960
Why do I have to bet with you?

231
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,350
Then you can leave.

232
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,200
I can look at it myself.

233
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,880
Do you know

234
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,280
how many poems

235
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,350
I wrote last night?

236
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,790
Do you know how His Majesty
and other officials will punish you

237
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,230
if you hurt me at this moment?

238
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,320
I don't care.

239
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,840
Even if the Princess Royal will get into trouble?

240
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,080
If you don't dare to bet,

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,710
push the door open and get out.

242
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,550
Are you trying to scare me?

243
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,640
You're thinking too much.

244
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,350
Fine. I'm in.

245
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,320
Show me your back.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,030
What if

247
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,470
the assassinator is not injured although it's shot?

248
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,200
Aren't you worried about it?

249
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,200
Even a Great Master will be injured

250
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,840
if he's shot by me with an arrow.

251
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,550
I see.

252
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,670
Director Yan, will you keep your promise?

253
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,590
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,350
Director Yan.

255
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,280
How about staying here for breakfast?

256
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,840
What's going on?

257
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,320
He pushed Ruoruo.

258
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,640
This is the least price he should pay.

259
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,880
You're protective of your sister.

260
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
Madam. Ruoruo.

261
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,670
I'm still sleepy.

262
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,640
I want to have more sleep.

263
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,640
Okay. Go have a rest.

264
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,520
Xian.

265
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,440
It's okay. Go back.

266
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,710
Let's go.

267
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,550
Don't hold it back. Spit it out.

268
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,320
Luckily, I met you on the way.

269
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,590
I had to hurry back

270
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,400
and came in

271
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,280
without letting Yan Xiaoyi know.

272
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,280
Neither of them was easy.

273
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,400
You're shot with an arrow.

274
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,840
Yes.

275
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,710
Yan Xiaoyi's arrow.

276
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,790
I'm not sure.

277
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,080
He said so.

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,760
There is no wound.

279
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,110
Uncle, do you want me to be injured?

280
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,440
He was not exaggerating.

281
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,550
Even a Great Master would be injured

282
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,000
if he's shot with Yan Xiaoyi's arrow.

283
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,550
He's the only Ninth Dan archer or above

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,710
in the world.

285
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,760
It's a coincidence that the arrow was blocked off

286
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,590
when it was shot in my waist.

287
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,280
The key?

288
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,640
Exactly.

289
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,200
Yan Xiaoyi's arrow

290
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,320
can even make cast iron break.

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,790
But the key is not damaged.

292
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,960
I don't know what it's made of.

293
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,000
Have you got everything done?

294
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,030
Almost.

295
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,640
I didn't have enough time

296
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
to put the counterfeit back.

297
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,760
Why not?

298
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
I saw the Princess Royal

299
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
had a secret meeting with Zhuang Mohan

300
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
and heard some secrets.

301
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,320
The Princess Royal

302
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,520
made a secret deal with Beiqi

303
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,320
and betrayed Yan Bingyun

304
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,640
to get Xiao En back.

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,710
Do you know?

306
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,710
Xiao En is

307
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,840
Zhuang Mohan's younger brother.

308
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,440
So, why didn't you

309
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,710
put the counterfeit back?

310
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,350
Fine.

311
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,520
Anyway, there is almost nothing

312
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,350
you really care about.

313
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,440
Don't worry.

314
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
I'll find a way

315
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,320
to put it back.

316
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,710
What's most important,

317
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
I'll finally know

318
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,880
what's in the box

319
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,280
my mom left.

320
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,590
Your memory. You open it.

321
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,680
But what's inside

322
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,830
may not be left for me.

323
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,040
We don't know until it's opened.

324
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,040
Why are you laughing?

325
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,710
Uncle,

326
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,350
you don't know

327
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,110
how ridiculous

328
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
life can be

329
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,590
in the world.

330
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,230
You sound surprised.

331
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,230
Well.

332
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,640
Do you know

333
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,760
how many resources and years

334
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,040
it'd take to make this?

335
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,800
Over ten years have passed.

336
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,950
Does it still work?

337
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,310
No idea.

338
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,760
Let's have a try.

339
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,430
Your Majesty, it's my fault.

340
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,230
The assassinator's whereabouts is unknown.

341
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
But I'm sure

342
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,520
he's shot with my arrow.

343
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,560
Tell him about it.

344
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,680
There are two assassinators.

345
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
One of them slipped into the imperial harem beforehand.

346
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,710
And I chased the other out of the imperial palace.

347
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,800
With hindsight,

348
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,710
it was a trick to lure the tiger from the mountain.

349
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,280
Did you catch him?

350
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,190
No.

351
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,880
He even ran away from you.

352
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Is he a Great Master?

353
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,040
Judging from his skill, he's just reached the Ninth Dan,

354
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,430
but he was quick.

355
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,400
The swordsmanship he used is Si Gujian.

356
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,000
Si Gujian?

357
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,230
The mission of Dongyi Town is still in the capital city.

358
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,830
Is it Yun Zhilan?

359
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,830
It couldn't be him.

360
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,950
Is it possible

361
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,830
he used Si Gujian to mislead us?

362
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,760
No.

363
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,350
That guy has grasped

364
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,520
the essence of Si Gujian.

365
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,190
It must've had something to do with Dongyi Town.

366
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,160
Your Majesty,

367
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,310
let's search the mission.

368
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,800
Even if it's not Yun Zhilan,

369
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,710
it must've been someone related to him.

370
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,470
Do you have evidence?

371
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,110
We will as long as we catch the two assassinators.

372
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,800
What if you fail to do that?

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,710
It...

374
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,880
The two assassinators sneaked into
the imperial palace late at night

375
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,190
and escaped unscathed.

376
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,400
If it spreads around,

377
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,230
it'd be unbearable shame for us.

378
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,400
I acknowledge my sin.

379
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,950
Seeing that guy is skilled at Si Gujian,

380
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,920
I couldn't help

381
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,230
to see more

382
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
so that I chased him for a long time.

383
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,280
Actually, it's my fault.

384
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,230
Before you admitted your fault,

385
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,880
you'd better think about why they wanted to kill Li Yunrui.

386
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,520
Of course to create chaos in the capital.

387
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,710
And then?

388
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,920
That's right.

389
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,310
If they did it,

390
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,040
what's the point of killing a Princess Royal

391
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,880
for Dongyi Town?

392
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,590
You can leave.

393
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,800
Got it.

394
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,400
See?

395
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,040
I said it doesn't work.

396
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,710
It can't be opened.

397
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,000
The password is correct.

398
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,760
We opened it.

399
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,400
Why?

400
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,430
Uncle.

401
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
It gives me a reason

402
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,710
to believe

403
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,590
there is some hidden secret

404
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,760
between you and my mom.

405
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,710
I really can't remember.

406
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
You don't need to say anything.

407
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,950
Let me have a look at

408
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,560
what she had left.

409
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,880
Are you sure it's not Fan Xian?

410
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,430
It couldn't be him.

411
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,640
As I said,

412
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,800
Fan Xian joined the poetry contest

413
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,640
and got drunk.

414
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
How could it be him?

415
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,830
Two assassinators worked together?

416
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,400
It might have something to do with Dongyi Town.

417
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,950
What did they want to do?

418
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,800
To kill me?

419
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,000
His Majesty also had doubt about that.

420
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,230
Xiaoyi, it doesn't make sense.

421
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,400
Find a way to tell Zhuang Mohan

422
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,760
and ask him to leave Nanqing.

423
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,310
The sooner the better.

424
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,760
Got it.

425
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,110
Something has gone wrong, right?

426
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,710
I have to think about it.

427
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,110
The iron is great,

428
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,350
but I wonder in which way

429
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,880
it was made to become like this.

430
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,800
I also wonder

431
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,560
why on earth

432
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,160
she left this stuff.

433
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,430
To kill people.

434
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,640
To kill people? It doesn't have sharp blades.

435
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,830
Do you know something about it?

436
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,000
Yes.

437
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,470
Uncle.

438
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,640
This is a great weapon.

439
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,830
Weapon?

440
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,110
An unparalleled weapon.

441
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,420
=To Wuzhu=

442
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,880
A letter.

443
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,230
It says "To Wuzhu".

444
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,640
Read it for me.

445
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,800
It's for you.

446
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,000
You can read anything

447
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,710
that belongs to me.

448
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,190
Okay.

449
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,880
Your Excellency.

450
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,070
Trust me.

451
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,430
Trust me.

452
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,640
Okay. Well.

453
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,310
Let's say goodbye here.

454
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,230
Remember what I said.

455
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,400
Take your stuff.

456
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,470
Don't come back to the capital

457
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,680
for the time being.

458
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,950
Don't be recognized.

459
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
Don't worry.

460
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,430
I shaved myself

461
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
because of this issue.

462
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,070
Nobody would recognize me.

463
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,190
All right.

464
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,830
Go ahead.

465
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,430
You said the horse would be mine.

466
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,190
It's for me.

467
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,710
You have to keep your promise.

468
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,760
I will.

469
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,830
That's great. I'm leaving.

470
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,430
Do you know how much

471
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,400
the horse cost me?

472
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,230
I paid for you.

473
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,560
That's right. You promised.

474
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,070
Don't break your word.

475
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,230
Go. Go. Go.

476
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,880
Go.

477
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,800
Don't tell anyone

478
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,160
about what happened last night.

479
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,310
I know the rules.

480
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,310
Head Chen.

481
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,800
Who is that guy?

482
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,800
Answer me.

483
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,640
What happened

484
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,760
last night?

485
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,590
Who is he?

486
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,640
He's just a locksmith.

487
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,310
Here is the thing, Head Chen.

488
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,400
Yesterday,

489
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,590
I asked him

490
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,350
to unlock the door of someone else's home.

491
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,470
So, I asked him

492
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,470
to get out of here.

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,040
Head Chen.

494
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,040
Look.

495
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,280
It's the first time

496
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,520
I stole something.

497
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,920
Please forgive me.

498
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,640
I can send a black knight

499
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,110
to get him back.

500
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,430
Don't.

501
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
I just asked him

502
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
to make a key.

503
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,110
Did the assassination attempt in the imperial palace

504
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,590
have anything to do with you?

505
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,070
Did it have anything to do with Fan Xian?

506
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,160
No.

507
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,950
No!

508
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,640
Do you know how capable he is?

509
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,430
Yeah.

510
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm giving you one more chance.

511
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,310
Is it Fan Xian that did it?

512
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:33,950
No.

513
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,560
Why don't you read?

514
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,920
The wording

515
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,350
is really special.

516
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,760
I'll begin.

517
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,830
Dear Zhuzhu, let me give you a kiss.

518
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,160
Zhuzhu is me.

519
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,230
I know.

520
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
Is it funny?

521
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,400
No.

522
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,920
I like you very much.

523
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,230
I tried many times

524
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,710
to introduce a girl to you,

525
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,560
but you're always like a cold fish.

526
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,470
This madam...

527
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,280
Sorry. You can't call me madam.

528
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,040
I think

529
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,400
you must be very popular among girls

530
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,430
if you smile more.

531
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,070
I think she's right.

532
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,760
Uncle, did she try to fix you up?

533
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,880
I don't remember.

534
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,230
Are you angry?

535
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,880
Why?

536
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,400
Forget about it. I'll continue.

537
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,640
At this moment,

538
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm staying in the capital alone.

539
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,520
So I decide to write you a letter.

540
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,070
You wouldn't listen to me

541
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,110
and has gone to fight in that temple again.

542
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,880
I guess you'd lose again

543
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,040
and finally come back.

544
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,640
So,

545
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,430
I'm writing this letter

546
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,640
to laugh at you in advance.

547
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,950
Uncle, you're smiling.

548
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,760
Really?

549
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,350
Did you really go to fight in that temple

550
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,280
and lose?

551
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,830
I think so.

552
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,680
Is it the so-called divine temple?

553
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,950
I don't remember.

554
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Why did you fight?

555
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,920
I don't remember.

556
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,830
What's the relationship between my mom

557
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,800
and you and that divine temple?

558
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,070
Fine.

559
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,430
I guess you don't remember, either.

560
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,590
Let's go on.

561
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,680
I've been worried about one thing.

562
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,560
I'm worried how you'll live in the world

563
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,920
without curiosity or desire

564
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,880
or anything you'd like to do.

565
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,520
So, I decide to leave the letter

566
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,430
in the box

567
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,950
and wouldn't ask you to open it.

568
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,000
If you open it

569
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,800
of your free will someday

570
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,110
and read the letter,

571
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,710
I'd be very happy

572
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,160
and surprised.

573
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,160
Can you tell me

574
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
what made you

575
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,710
want to open the box?

576
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,830
Nothing special.

577
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,000
I just want to know

578
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,400
what you left

579
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,590
to the world

580
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,520
and whether you'd mention me.

581
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,640
Uncle Wuzhu.

582
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,590
Go on.

583
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,590
This madam came to this world,

584
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,350
in parenthesis,

585
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,880
this madam means me, your sister.

586
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,520
I came. I saw. I played.

587
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,680
I was once the richest person.

588
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,880
I even...

589
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,920
...pulled the old emperor's beard.

590
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,830
I just didn't unify the whole world.

591
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,880
But what's the point of doing that?

592
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,400
If there is

593
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,920
still something I want to do,

594
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,230
I want to see the world

595
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,520
become a better place

596
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,800
and everyone can

597
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,950
smile more brightly.

598
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,560
It sounds stupid, right?

599
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,310
Don't laugh.

600
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,430
I didn't.

601
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,430
I don't know why,

602
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,470
but I feel like I'm writing my last words.

603
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,350
Zhuzhu,

604
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,110
I don't know how long would pass

605
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,190
when you see the letter

606
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,000
and I don't know if I'd still be alive.

607
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,280
If I'm already dead,

608
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,920
just destroy everything in the box.

609
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,470
I don't need anyone else

610
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,680
to know my story.

611
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,280
They don't deserve it.

612
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,880
Zhuzhu,

613
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,680
actually, you don't understand

614
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,800
where I'm from.

615
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,560
Do you know? I'm lonely.

616
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,760
There are many people in the world,

617
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,190
but I'm lonely.

618
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm really lonely.

619
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,760
But luckily, you've been with me

620
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,190
when I felt most lonely.

621
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,800
Zhuzhu,

622
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,800
I really miss you.

623
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,190
That's all.

624
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,520
Do you miss her?

625
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,710
What does it mean?

626
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,400
It...

627
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,310
It means

628
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,710
no matter if you're walking,

629
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,560
eating,

630
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,160
sleeping,

631
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,160
fighting,

632
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,000
or doing something else,

633
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,830
and no matter how many people are around you,

634
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,400
you can't

635
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,350
drive her out of your mind

636
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,280
and you speak her name quietly.

637
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,230
You hear many people speak,

638
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,310
but you just want to hear

639
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,430
her voice.

640
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,880
You've seen many faces,

641
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,000
but you just want to see

642
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,190
her smile.

643
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,560
In this case, you miss her.

644
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,390
I miss her.

645
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
Assassinators sneaked in last night?

646
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,800
They showed up at Guangxin Palace.

647
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,390
Did they aim to kill Li Yunrui?

648
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,950
It's still unknown.

649
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,840
She doesn't want to lose control of Neiku.

650
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,870
It makes some guys jealous.

651
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,710
Was everything going well

652
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,560
here last night?

653
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,080
Everything as usual.

654
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,000
And I had a good sleep.

655
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,430
I'm relieved to hear that.

656
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,670
Don't tell anyone else

657
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,520
about Lady Ye's issue.

658
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,710
But I think you're different.

659
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,520
I'll put it back,

660
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,080
but don't throw the box into the river.

661
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
It'll be of use sooner or later.

662
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,760
There is one more layer here.

663
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,040
One more letter.

664
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,280
Zhuzhu, don't open this letter.

665
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,630
What is it?

666
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,190
I don't know.

667
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,040
Do you want to open it?

668
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,230
Can I open it?

669
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,910
She didn't say you can't do that.

670
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,910
Hi, my son.

671
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,670
You didn't misread it.

672
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,190
This letter is for you.

673
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,080
I wasn't born

674
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,430
when she wrote it, right?

675
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,600
Right.

676
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,840
How did she know she'd have a son?

677
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,360
She guessed.

678
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,950
Only you can have a chance to

679
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,870
read the letter.

680
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,760
I know.

681
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,320
You have a lot of questions

682
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,520
about yourself,

683
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,800
about me and about the world.

684
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,670
I'll tell you the answer now.

685
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,710
Fan Xian,

686
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,190
there is no time travel

687
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,000
and there is no parallel spacetime.

688
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,190
Here is still the Earth.

689
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,800
It's still our world.

690
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,360
The Earth has never stopped spinning

691
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,230
during the past over four billion years.

692
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,560
During the long period,

693
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,520
several special eras

694
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,630
have appeared.

695
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,040
As global cooling happened substantially,

696
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,950
areas at higher latitudes

697
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,800
witnessed the formation of massive ice sheets.

698
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,870
Water condensed into ice.

699
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,080
Both atmospheric circulation and ocean currents

700
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,390
changed accordingly.

701
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,320
In such an era,

702
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,280
the entire planet went white.

703
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,150
That's called a major ice age.

704
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,630
It's interesting.

705
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
It would happen

706
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,150
every once in a while.

707
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,870
In our day,

708
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,320
there was much speculation

709
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,950
about when the next ice age

710
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,630
would arrive

711
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,320
and if humans would become extinct.

712
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,150
Our time has ended.

713
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Fan Xian,

714
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,470
we opened the Forbidden Door.

715
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,800
I hope our time would revive

716
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,280
when a new era arrives.

717
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,230
Have you ever seen a sci-fi movie?

718
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,710
People might be frozen

719
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,670
in an instrument.

720
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,230
Years later, people sleeping inside

721
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,520
would come out as the instrument is opened.

722
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,470
I'm

723
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,760
just a living example.

724
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,870
My mom was revived from a frozen state.

725
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,430
Frozen?

726
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,910
It could be.

727
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,360
When I woke up,

728
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,630
the ice age had been over.

729
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,840
The old days are gone

730
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,840
and new humans have appeared.

731
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,910
They've gone through primitive society

732
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,950
and then slavery society.

733
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,120
Now, they're living in feudal society:

734
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,360
Nanqing.

735
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,910
Have you ever thought about

736
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,840
why people here

737
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,120
also speak Chinese

738
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
and behave

739
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,630
like we did in our day?

740
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,360
Because I'm not the only one

741
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,600
who was revived after being frozen.

742
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,320
Many pioneers

743
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,600
survived

744
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,950
and spread civilization to new humans.

745
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,710
It can be considered

746
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,870
some heritage from our time.

747
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,280
Their legends

748
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,950
are the secrets of the divine temple.

749
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,150
What on earth is the Forbidden Door?

750
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,190
Why did it cause an ice age?

751
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,840
How on earth

752
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,000
did humans in our day become extinct?

753
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,080
And,

754
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,600
if I was revived after being frozen,

755
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,080
why did I become a baby?

756
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,600
You're not revived after being frozen.

757
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,190
You're an exceptional case.

758
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,840
Let me put it this way.

759
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,390
We had an experiment

760
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,670
about datamation of memories.

761
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,870
You're one of the guinea pigs.

762
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,670
And you're the only one that made it.

763
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,320
I know you have many questions.

764
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,230
The answer you're looking for

765
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,080
is hidden

766
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,360
in a place called Taiping Residence.

767
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,560
If you've ever been there,

768
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,560
you'd find there is a pond in the yard,

769
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,760
at the bottom of which

770
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,190
is hidden a starting gear.

771
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,800
Through operation of it,

772
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,080
you'd see

773
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,390
a blank door is opened in the house.

774
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,280
From the secrets of the Forbidden Door

775
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,230
to the reason why humans became extinct,

776
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,870
all the answers you're looking for

777
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,800
can be found there.

778
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,840
Go there if you want to find it out.

779
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,950
Personally, I hope

780
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,520
you won't work on these secrets.

781
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,000
If you go behind the Forbidden Door

782
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,630
and find the truth,

783
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,950
you're destined to go back

784
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,470
to where I escaped

785
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,630
and face the most horrible things

786
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,230
underground.

787
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,710
If you stay away from that door,

788
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,870
all these dangers

789
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,360
will have nothing to do with you.

790
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,600
You can enjoy a peaceful,

791
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,760
happy life.

792
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,910
The way you live your life is up to you.

793
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,320
That's all my suggestions.

794
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,800
One more thing,

795
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,230
there is no vitality Qi.

796
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,470
The so-called vitality Qi

797
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,320
is actually something

798
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,760
left from the last era.

799
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,080
By the way,

800
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,150
be nice to Wuzhu.

801
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,800
Did you hear it?

802
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,630
Yes.

803
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,000
The secrets hidden at the bottom of the pond

804
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,950
at Taiping Residence.

805
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,910
Do you want to find it out?

806
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm not sure.

807
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,800
She said it's dangerous.

808
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,760
My mind told me not to,

809
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,360
but I'm curious.

810
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,710
What do you think?

811
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,840
Up to you.

812
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,320
She asked me to be nice to you.

813
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,710
I don't understand.

814
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,560
You're a martial arts master.

815
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,230
You don't need me to take care of you, right?

816
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,420
In the river of history,

817
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,620
time goes round and round.

818
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,980
Memories about the former and present lives

819
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,860
join each other in an endless way.

820
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,460
In the long drunken Milky Way,

821
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,180
one season follows another in a flash,

822
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,380
and the wild geese are flying south.

823
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,300
I just can't give up

824
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,300
to be with you for my whole life.

825
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,580
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

826
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

827
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,260
Year after year in the wandering,

828
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,820
I count the remaining years.

829
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,020
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

830
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,580
even though we have ended up the destiny,

831
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,260
I never feel regretful.

832
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,220
In such a chaotic world,

833
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,980
I still miss you as ever.

834
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,620
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

835
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,340
With a gentle heart,

836
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,900
I cherish our remaining years.

837
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,740
Even though we have to go through

838
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,700
all the hardships along the journey,

839
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:12,020
you always stay by my side,

840
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,780
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

841
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,700
Year after year in the wandering,

842
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,060
I count the remaining years.

843
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,420
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

844
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,220
even though we end up the destiny,

845
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,660
I never feel regretful.

846
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,580
In such a chaotic world,

847
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,540
I still miss you as ever.

848
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,220
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

849
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,980
With a gentle heart,

850
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,380
I cherish our remaining years.

851
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,180
Even though we have to go through

852
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,340
all the hardships along the journey,

853
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:52,620
you always stay by my side...
