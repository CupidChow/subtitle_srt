1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 22

16
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,310
Uncle.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,190
What's up, Uncle Wuzhu?

18
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,550
Uncle.

19
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,480
Uncle.

20
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,870
Uncle Wuzhu.

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,590
Uncle! Uncle!

22
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,190
I think I remember

23
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,390
where the Taiping Residence is.

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,830
Where is it?

25
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,800
2.5 km east of the city.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,910
The key to my mom's box

27
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,800
might be hidden

28
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,520
in the Taiping Residence.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,440
If we find it,

30
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,190
you may get your memory back.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,190
Let's go there tomorrow.

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,390
No, I can't.

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,390
If I rush to

34
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,080
the Taiping Residence now,

35
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,360
I will draw a lot of attention.

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,440
Then I will go.

37
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,190
Neither can you.

38
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,470
I have an idea.

39
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,000
But I need a few days for preparation.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,240
For this trip out of the capital,

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,750
we'll need a lot of company.

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,270
Why?

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Crowds can make it easier

44
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,360
to hide the truth.

45
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:04,160
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
We've made a large purchase of paper,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,550
and the unit price is three qians higher than expected.

48
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,550
Luckily, we've cut the number of servants.

49
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,670
That might make up to it.

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,030
Don't think about this on a trip out of the city.

51
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,830
What's your problem, Fan Xian? Give it to me.

52
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,030
What should you call him?

53
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,670
Brother.

54
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,600
Give it to me!

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,960
You don't have to worry about that.

56
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,600
Then who will take care of it?

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,720
Our bookstore is going to open soon.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,750
You don't write books.

59
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,800
You only fool around.

60
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,910
Who asked to come along?

61
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,390
I just want to keep an eye on him.

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
Your Excellency, the girls are in front.

63
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,520
You can't go inside!

64
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,830
Ling'er also wants to go for an outing.

65
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,440
Do you mind

66
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,950
if we can go out together?

67
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,070
I don't mind.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,720
More people, more fun.

69
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,830
I don't know how you made it.

70
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,320
The northern side of our country is at war,

71
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,350
but His Majesty actually

72
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,640
agreed on us coming out.

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,200
We should enjoy life

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,480
even when the war is intense.

75
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,110
So the enemies can feel our confidence

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,880
in winning the war.

77
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,070
You're talking nonsense.

78
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,830
Walking out more often

79
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,830
is good for your health.

80
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,640
Whatever you say.

81
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,790
Really?

82
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,950
I miss you.

83
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,070
If only we could get married sooner.

84
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,920
Then we can be together every day.

85
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,640
Fine. Fine. Fine.

86
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
I'll take another carriage.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,550
Enjoy yourselves.

88
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,920
Lady Ye,

89
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,640
how can you get off alone,

90
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,950
leaving My Lady alone with that...

91
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,350
If I stay for another minute, I'm gonna puke.

92
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,040
If you can tolerate that,

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
you can go inside.

94
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,670
Can you be gentle?

95
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,760
You...

96
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
How come it's you, tigress?

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,950
Where do you hide my brother?

98
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,480
Lady Fan Ruoruo,

99
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,550
someone acted so shamelessly

100
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,200
in Princess Lin's carriage.

101
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,510
It's really awkward

102
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,600
for me to stay there.

103
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,920
If you don't mind,

104
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,950
I will stay with you.

105
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,670
Come over and take a seat.

106
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,830
Sister!

107
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,320
How can you let her

108
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,440
stay with us?

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,160
You must protect me!

110
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,600
Sister, you must protect me!

111
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,160
Your trick works. Are you happy now?

112
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,640
Those words are from the bottom of my heart.

113
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,640
Why aren't we leaving?

114
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,200
There's one more person to come.

115
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,040
One more person?

116
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,720
Xianxian!

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,920
Dabao!

118
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,390
Wan'er!

119
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,880
I invited him.

120
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,350
Dabao, come over now.

121
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,480
I'll stay here.

122
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,720
Dad said,

123
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,320
I should... I should...

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,790
I should...

125
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,670
give

126
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,920
Xianxian and Wan'er

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
more private space.

128
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,110
Good boy! You're the best.

129
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,320
Dabao, sit well in the carriage.

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,350
Let's go for an outing.

131
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,160
Xianxian, you really know how to play.

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
Don't call me Xianxian.

133
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,640
OK.

134
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,550
Xianxian!

135
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,200
The war is on.

136
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,760
Yan Ruohai is at the border

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,440
dealing with secret information.

138
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,720
He's terribly busy.

139
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,160
God blesses Nanqing.

140
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,440
We're doing really well in the war.

141
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,390
But recently,

142
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,880
officials from the Six Ministries start to clamor,

143
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,670
advocating that

144
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,040
we should capture Beiqi

145
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,670
at one fling.

146
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,830
Who started it?

147
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,320
We don't know yet.

148
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,440
But officials who take part

149
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,160
are from Six Ministries.

150
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,600
Investigate them thoroughly.

151
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,390
Head...

152
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,670
The "gnawing-away" scheme

153
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,270
set by His Majesty is the safest.

154
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,390
The war is about to end.

155
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,600
Whoever advocate capturing Beiqi

156
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,550
are traitors.

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,350
Many officials from our Office

158
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,390
also hold this view.

159
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,510
In their opinion,

160
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,230
it's the best chance to unify the whole world.

161
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Investigate them, punish them,

162
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,320
or even kill them if you have to.

163
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Yes.

164
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,830
Many people hope to capture Beiqi with one blow.

165
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,470
The louder they advocate, the sooner they'll give up!

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,000
Is Fan Xian OK?

167
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,030
He goes for an outing

168
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,880
with Lin Wan'er.

169
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
Why don't you go along?

170
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,150
I can't.

171
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,470
If anything happens to you,

172
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,400
I won't be able to get back.

173
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,550
How can anything happen to me?

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,670
Recently,

175
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,440
there's been a secret voice against
you in the Investigator's Office.

176
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,320
Someone is fed up with

177
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,550
your control.

178
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,960
Who might that be?

179
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,440
If I know, I'll kill him.

180
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,520
Chen Pingping, be careful about the people around you.

181
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,640
What's up?

182
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,790
The Head wants to investigate

183
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,760
which officials from the Six Ministries advocate war.

184
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,840
That's the job of your division.

185
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,230
Recently,

186
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,790
there have been officials meeting secretly everywhere,

187
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,440
planning to submit a joint memorial

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,110
for wiping out Beiqi at one blow.

189
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,910
You really should carry out a thorough investigation.

190
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,440
Last night

191
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,790
in the residence of the Assistant
Minister of Ministry of Penalty,

192
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,030
someone from our Investigator's Office

193
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,150
was also there.

194
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,200
Do you know

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,470
what you've been doing?

196
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,960
My son is still at the capital of Beiqi.

197
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,790
The earlier Beiqi is captured,

198
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,030
the sooner

199
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,760
he can be safe.

200
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,790
I haven't told the Head about it.

201
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,400
It's not too late to stop.

202
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,350
With the "gnawing-away" scheme,

203
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,790
how many years will it be

204
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,960
to capture Beiqi.

205
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
We don't have a say in this.

206
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,910
Whatever I do,

207
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,400
I do it for Nanqing.

208
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,710
So does the Head.

209
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,590
He's old.

210
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,280
Enough!

211
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,710
Don't make me arrest you myself!

212
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,640
Can I poke it?

213
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,230
No! It will bite you.

214
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,670
Is it poisonous?

215
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,520
I don't know.

216
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,470
Look, there's another hole here.

217
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
Will it

218
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,710
hide something inside?

219
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,790
Childish!

220
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,080
Poke it! Poke it!

221
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,030
Dabao.

222
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,790
Don't play with worms.

223
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,790
How about learning

224
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,440
some self-defense moves from me?

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,030
Self-defense moves!

226
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,230
Is that fun?

227
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,030
Dabao.

228
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,080
Don't talk to her.

229
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,670
Don't.

230
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,550
She is a tigress.

231
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,000
She eats people. She's horrible.

232
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,280
She's not.

233
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,880
She's Wan'er's friend.

234
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,000
She's not scary.

235
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,080
I'm Fan Xian's younger brother.

236
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,150
Don't you believe me?

237
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,590
Xianxian?

238
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,960
If you don't believe me,

239
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,320
don't you believe Xianxian?

240
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,280
Sister,

241
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,710
he told me you're a tigress.

242
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,350
Will you eat people?

243
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,000
What?

244
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,910
Fan Sizhe, do you need a good beat?

245
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,550
I didn't say that.

246
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,110
Stop!

247
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,590
Hurry up! Run!

248
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,790
Little one, just run!

249
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,400
Stop!

250
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,590
The tigress will eat you.

251
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,790
Hurry up and run! Hurry up and run!

252
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,400
I didn't expect them

253
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,230
to have fun together.

254
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,840
Dabao still retains childlike innocence.

255
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,590
He's willing to come out with you,

256
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,910
which means he really trusts you.

257
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,440
We will be family in future.

258
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,080
Thank you.

259
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,030
Thank me for what?

260
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,110
I know that

261
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,910
my second brother's funeral is being
held in the Prime Minister's mansion.

262
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,200
As a bastard daughter,

263
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,280
I can't go there.

264
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,550
Your father said

265
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,640
he doesn't want Dabao

266
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,670
to stay in the mansion, either.

267
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,030
He said since your bother is gone,

268
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,440
no need to make the living ones suffer.

269
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,840
Stop!

270
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,590
You really need a good beat!

271
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,840
But he's my second brother after all.

272
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,710
Where's Ruoruo?

273
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,030
Where is she?

274
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,440
She's probably idling around.

275
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,230
Let her be.

276
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,790
Have some fruit.

277
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,200
Your Highness,

278
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,230
the three-day punishment is over.

279
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,640
Read these days' information

280
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,710
to me.

281
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,710
Yes.

282
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,150
Recently,

283
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,520
there have been hot debates in the imperial court.

284
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,470
We've achieved a complete victory in the war against Beiqi.

285
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Now, many officials from different ministries

286
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,110
want to submit a joint memorial

287
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,760
to advocate capturing Beiqi at one blow.

288
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,960
The Second Prince is contacting the Ministry of War.

289
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,760
Fan Xian and Princess Wan'er

290
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,550
left the capital city.

291
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,080
Where did they go?

292
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,470
They left for an outing

293
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,760
from the South Gate.

294
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,760
The South Gate?

295
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,150
Yesterday, the Empress Dowager...

296
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,550
The Prime Minister visited

297
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,470
Princess Wan'er last night.

298
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,590
How do we get the information?

299
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,760
A little eunuch from Imperial Clothes Division

300
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
and a guard from the imperial residence

301
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,910
are cousins.

302
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,910
Last night, when visiting his cousin,

303
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,470
the eunuch saw the Prime Minister

304
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,280
entering the residence in casual clothes.

305
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,200
He reported the information when he came back.

306
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,640
So Lin Ruofu secretly visited

307
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,520
Lin Wan'er late at night

308
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,590
without telling anyone.

309
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,710
Don't you find it weird?

310
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,880
What's wrong?

311
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,470
Will Lin Wan'er

312
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,790
tell Fan Xian about it?

313
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,880
Now the Prime Minister roots for Fan Xian.

314
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,670
Why should she hide it from him?

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,880
Get the carriage ready!

316
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,200
Your Highness, where are we going?

317
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,080
Let's go for an outing.

318
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,520
I've got it.

319
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,350
Let me see.

320
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,320
It's so heavy.

321
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,520
Let me help you.

322
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,710
What have you got?

323
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,670
Don't tell anyone

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,110
about my visit,

325
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,110
especially Fan Xian.

326
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,200
When you go outing tomorrow,

327
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,840
do one thing for me.

328
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,150
When you're out,

329
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,320
find an excuse to go deep into the woods

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,790
with Fan Xian only.

331
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,150
Remember that

332
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,790
no matter what happens...

333
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,710
What's wrong? Are you OK?

334
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,590
I'm fine.

335
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,520
How do you feel recently?

336
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,760
Do you feel anything wrong?

337
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,030
Nothing.

338
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,080
Nothing wrong.

339
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,560
Got it!

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,230
Put it down! Put it down! Put it down!

341
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,310
The Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Rites

342
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,230
has come to offer his condolences in person.

343
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,800
Won't you see him?

344
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,590
If I meet him, we will talk politely.

345
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,640
He will say restrain your grief, and I will say thank you.

346
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,310
It's so boring.

347
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,880
But you should be

348
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,680
at the mourning hall.

349
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,830
Will my son come back to life

350
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,880
if I'm there?

351
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,280
Have you sent out the men?

352
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,190
They're all martial arts masters.
They're waiting outside the capital city.

353
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,950
But Fan Xian and Wan'er

354
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,350
have taken out many attendants.

355
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,160
It won't be easy for them to attack.

356
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,950
He will leave the crowd.

357
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,800
What on earth are you going to do?

358
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,640
By then, Fan Xian

359
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,400
will be attacked.

360
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,350
You should act as if you know nothing.

361
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,640
Don't give yourself away.

362
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,950
Don't you support Fan Xian

363
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,880
all along?

364
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,830
Haven't you entrusted Fan Xian

365
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,830
with the future of

366
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,920
the Lin family?

367
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,470
I still don't know who killed Gong'er.

368
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,160
I can trust the Lin family

369
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,640
to an outsider.

370
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,830
But I must

371
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,520
remove all my doubts.

372
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,520
Were you pretending to

373
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,880
be supportive all these days?

374
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,000
Not really.

375
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,560
If Fan Xian can pass this test,

376
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,040
I really want to make him

377
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,310
the backbone of the Lin family.

378
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,710
The day the Second Young Master was killed,

379
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Fan Xian really didn't leave the capital city.

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,280
I have a suspicion.

381
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,920
What if there's a hidden martial arts master

382
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,520
by Fan Xian's side,

383
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,280
a master who could

384
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
match the Four Great Masters?

385
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,560
Fan Xian was inside the capital city,

386
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,070
but that martial arts master killed Gong'er instead.

387
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,160
According to Si Lili,

388
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
she didn't tell Fan Xian

389
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,920
the secret of the Second Young Master.

390
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Her words don't matter.

391
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,110
As long as evidences show that

392
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,830
there's a peerless martial arts master

393
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,680
around Fan Xian,

394
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,230
I can confirm that

395
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,110
he's the one who killed Gong'er.

396
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,560
That's why you asked me

397
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
to send all our martial arts masters

398
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,640
out of the city.

399
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,470
This assassination

400
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
is the final test.

401
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,350
Dabao and Wan'er are also there.

402
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,110
What if they get hurt...

403
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,350
Because they are there,

404
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,560
no one would believe that

405
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,680
I'm the one who planned it.

406
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,350
I hope there wouldn't be

407
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,880
such a martial arts master.

408
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,800
I've got it! I've got it!

409
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,400
I told you.

410
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,680
I don't lie.

411
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,920
You got it, right?

412
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,920
Now we've got two.

413
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
It's your turn now.

414
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,110
Watch me!

415
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,400
What's wrong?

416
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,920
I want to...

417
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,400
You want what?

418
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,710
I want to go somewhere quiet.

419
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
Why?

420
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,560
Wan'er.

421
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,040
Here, it's for you!

422
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Where have you been?

423
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,310
The flower field over there.

424
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Brother, stop sitting here as a fool.

425
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,880
Come with me to pick some flowers.

426
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,400
You can make Wan'er a garland yourself.

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,680
OK.

428
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,590
Wan'er, wait for a moment.

429
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,830
Brother, I found the Taiping Residence.

430
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,680
Walk along the river to the east, and you'll see it.

431
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,800
OK.

432
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,350
I'll go and see.

433
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,280
Stay here to cover me.

434
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,950
Brother, I'll go with you.

435
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Hurry up!

436
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,640
Don't let them find out.

437
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,430
Listen!

438
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,230
When Fan Xian comes into the woods alone,

439
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,640
we should spare no efforts in striking him down.

440
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,800
Be careful.

441
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,230
Don't hurt our lady.

442
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,950
Do you understand?

443
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,560
Yes.

444
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:04,920
How's it going?

445
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,710
They are over there.

446
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,280
Have you seen Fan Xian?

447
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,560
I only saw our lady. Fan Xian was not there.

448
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,350
What?

449
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,230
You didn't see Fan Xian.

450
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,520
Right.

451
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,230
I sneaked over

452
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,280
and saw our lady and the First Young Master.

453
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,110
But Fan Xian was not there.

454
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,230
What's happening?

455
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,310
Take it easy.

456
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,040
We'll wait till he shows up.

457
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,230
Go and check again.

458
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,430
Yes.

459
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,190
It's right ahead.

460
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,640
My mom used to live

461
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,520
in the Taiping Residence.

462
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,590
I can't let others know

463
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,560
I've been here.

464
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,110
So I came up with the idea of going for an outing.

465
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,520
I know.

466
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,880
Your secret is safe with me.

467
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,310
Uncle Wuzhu will be here in a moment.

468
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,230
You haven't met yet.

469
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,640
Is he easy to get along?

470
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,520
He seldom talks.

471
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,310
Are you here to mourn her?

472
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,710
No, we're here for a key.

473
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,000
A key?

474
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,680
It's right ahead.

475
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,280
Brother, here it is.

476
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,350
My mom used to live here.

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,230
There's no weed on the walls.

478
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,800
It is well cleaned.

479
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,880
Perhaps someone lives here.

480
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,000
Impossible.

481
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,160
If someone lives here,

482
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,760
there should be smoke rising from

483
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,880
the chimney right now.

484
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,880
Maybe he eats early.

485
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,400
It's so quiet around.

486
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,920
Not even a chirp from birds.

487
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,040
Whatever it might be,

488
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,400
let's go over first.

489
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,470
Brother, look.

490
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,710
The flowers here are really beautiful.

491
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,040
Let's fetch some for my sister-in-law.

492
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,280
After all, we told her

493
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,310
we're here to pick flowers.

494
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,710
Let's hurry back.

495
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,680
Don't keep them waiting.

496
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,640
Here you are.

497
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,070
Catch me!

498
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,110
Catch me! Catch me! Catch me!

499
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,470
I've got one! I've got one!

500
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,640
Xianxian!

501
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,950
Look, I've got a fish.

502
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,470
I've got one! I've got one!

503
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,430
Xianxian, I've got some fish.

504
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,310
I'm not a fish.

505
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,880
This time,

506
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,760
I'll be the fish. Come and catch me, OK?

507
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,590
Catch me!

508
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,680
Catch me!

509
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,710
Catch me! Catch me! Catch me!

510
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,590
You are back...

511
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,830
Your Highness!

512
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,560
Cousin.

513
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,880
Where's Fan Xian?

514
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,310
He went to pick flowers.

515
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,520
Do you want to see him?

516
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,800
All rise. No need to make a fuss.

517
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
Let's go for a walk.

518
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,520
When Fan Xian gets back, ask him to wait for me.

519
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,070
OK.

520
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,590
What time is it now?

521
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,470
It's time.

522
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,350
What if they fail?

523
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,430
They were kept

524
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,520
outside the capital city before.

525
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,280
Even if they fail,

526
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,880
they won't get us in trouble.

527
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Moreover,

528
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,520
they've never seen Fan Xian before.

529
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,070
They won't give themselves away.

530
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,400
Master, you've helped me a lot.

531
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
What if there's no martial arts master

532
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,640
by Fan Xian's side?

533
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,560
Then I'm afraid

534
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,880
I will never know who killed Gong'er.

535
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,950
Boss!

536
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,920
What's up?

537
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,070
He left.

538
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,710
Who left?

539
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,950
Our lady and a young man

540
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,590
left alone.

541
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,000
Master Yuan has told us in advance that

542
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the man left with our lady

543
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,190
must be Fan Xian.

544
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,000
Remember!

545
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,710
Later, we'll do whatever we can

546
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,800
to make his martial arts master

547
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,830
show up.

548
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Do you understand?

549
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,310
Yes.

550
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,520
Let's go!

551
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,710
Cousin, where are your guards?

552
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
My carriage is stopped far away.

553
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,230
You're too incautious.

554
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,230
We can't talk with them around.

555
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,470
Cousin, what do you want to talk about?

556
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,830
What on earth did your father

557
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,760
tell you last night?

558
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,880
Let me guess.

559
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,800
Your father is still suspicious of

560
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,040
Fan Xian.

561
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,310
Right?

562
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,110
It's an easy guess.

563
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,000
Your father acts cautiously all his life,

564
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,280
but he trusts Fan Xian

565
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,800
too easily.

566
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,160
It must be hard for you.

567
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,040
Brother, I can't see the archer.

568
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,310
Stay where you are.

569
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,160
Brother!

570
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,830
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

571
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,560
Brother!

572
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,680
Who shot the arrows?

573
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,070
The arrow is to keep people

574
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,000
away from the Taiping Residence.

575
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,520
Uncle Wuzhu.

576
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,000
Not bad.

577
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,070
Actually, it's fine for Ruoruo to see you.

578
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,110
Don't worry.

579
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,680
She'll wake up in a while.

580
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,160
I know who killed Lin Gong.

581
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,400
Are you going to name my second cousin again?

582
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,830
Who is he?

583
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,310
It's not Fan Xian.

584
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,560
You don't have to worry.

585
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,110
Then who on earth is he?

586
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Just tell your father.

587
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,070
The murderer is a Great Master.

588
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,560
Then what?

589
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,800
Tell him everything,

590
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,190
and he will understand naturally.

591
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,710
Why can't you tell me?

592
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,590
It's a serious matter.

593
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,560
Fan Xian, you'll die today.

594
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,880
What do you call me?

595
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,000
He's not Fan Xian.

596
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,880
No need to lie.

597
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,590
Fan Xian owes us a huge debt of blood.

598
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,950
We can recognize him

599
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,430
even if he's turned into ashes.

600
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,280
He really isn't Fan Xian.

601
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,710
Young lady, no need to worry.

602
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,680
We only want to kill Fan Xian.

603
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,280
We don't know you.

604
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,310
We certainly won't hurt you.

605
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,590
What's this all about?

606
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,880
Does your father plan all of this?

607
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,400
You...

608
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,470
Shut up!

609
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,920
Let me tell you.

610
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,400
What between us is personal.

611
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,160
It has nothing to do with the Prime Minister.

612
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,430
If you really don't know her,

613
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,470
how do you know her father is the Prime Minister?

614
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,520
Brothers!

615
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,920
Take him to somewhere quiet.

616
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,830
Take his life.

617
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,800
Wait! Wait!

618
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,640
Wait!

619
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
Wait! Wait!

620
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
He's the Crown Prince.

621
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,070
Well...

622
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,830
I've seen the shots.

623
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,230
It must be a martial arts master of the Ninth Dan.

624
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,400
What to do now?

625
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,190
I will hold him.

626
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,470
You should sneak in from another direction

627
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,040
to find the key.

628
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I've never been here.

629
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,280
Can we switch?

630
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,760
I'll be the diversion, and you can look for the key inside.

631
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,070
A Ninth Dan archer is rare in the world.

632
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,520
You're no match for him.

633
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,560
This place is so big.

634
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,400
Where should I start?

635
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,110
Right opposite the square tower in the lake.

636
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,920
Get into the bedroom.

637
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,830
Check the bookshelf and space below the bed.

638
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,710
You remembered!

639
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,310
I remember something after seeing the high walls.

640
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,830
How will you hold him?

641
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,160
Uncle!

642
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,560
Unbelievable!

643
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,760
Boss, why not cover your face?

644
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,920
No need. He has seen my face just now.

645
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,710
It's been a while. No one has shown up.

646
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,310
Should we let him go?

647
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,520
Are we going to see the Prime Minister?

648
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,760
Shut up! Back off!

649
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,430
Go!

650
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Listen.

651
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,070
He knows the Prime Minister is behind this.

652
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,710
We can't let him go.

653
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,640
What should we do?

654
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,830
How could I know?

655
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,350
Nothing happens.

656
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,580
=Taiping Residence=

657
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,680
What is he up to?

658
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,560
A Ninth Dan archer.

659
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,300
=Yan Xiaoyi, Director of Imperial Guards of Nanqing=

660
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,710
Your shot was pretty good.

661
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,110
How heavy is your bow?

662
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,350
Go ahead.

663
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,560
No need to get out.

664
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,920
I'll sit right here.

665
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,160
Shoot me if you dare.

666
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm here.

667
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,310
She'll be fine.

668
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,560
Be careful.

669
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,600
If you dare not,

670
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,360
I'll go inside

671
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,230
after eating this piece.

672
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,950
Let's go back.

673
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
I've got you.

674
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,120
No one?

675
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,800
Let's go back.

676
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,000
You woke up when the tree fell down.

677
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,710
Why don't you talk?

678
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,870
I thought

679
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,870
you may not want to be seen.

680
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,710
Fan Xian trusts you.

681
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,190
Who's that archer?

682
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,000
Has my brother

683
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
entered the yard?

684
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,190
Will he be in danger?

685
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,080
Tell me!

686
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,520
Your Majesty, why are you here?

687
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,840
You should be the one to answer that question.

688
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
I... I...

689
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,870
I was on a date with Wan'er

690
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,560
outside the capital city.

691
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,950
Then I just idled around

692
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,670
and walked here.

693
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,560
I found this yard

694
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,230
and felt thirsty.

695
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,600
So I came in to get some water.

696
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,600
Really? Go on.

697
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,910
I was looking for water,

698
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,040
and then I found Your Majesty.

699
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,000
Do you know who once lived in this yard?

700
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,040
I've no idea.

701
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,800
It was an old friend of mine.

702
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,870
When I was free,

703
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,950
I would often visit here and take a walk.

704
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
What kind of a person was she?

705
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,430
Fan Xian,

706
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,120
you've never knelt down

707
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,840
before me, right?

708
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,320
I can kneel down now if you ask.

709
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,470
Your Majesty,

710
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,190
a highly-skilled archer

711
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,760
made an attack by the river just now.

712
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm afraid he was trying to lure the guards away.

713
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,280
So I take the liberty to see whether Your Majesty is OK.

714
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
I'm fine.

715
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,870
If Your Majesty is fine,

716
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,000
then I'm relieved.

717
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,390
One more thing.

718
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,670
Your Majesty, do you need anything to eat?

719
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,560
I've finished my meal.

720
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,560
This is Yan Xiaoyi,

721
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,390
Director of Imperial Guards,

722
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,120
a martial arts master above the Ninth Dan.

723
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,560
He's only one step away from the Great Master.

724
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,800
I almost forgot that

725
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,320
martial arts master above the Ninth Dan

726
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,080
can distinguish two people by breaths

727
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,430
through the wall.

728
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,080
Put down your arrow.

729
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,520
I'm not under threat.

730
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,470
This is Fan Xian, Chief Musician of
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

731
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,280
When he leaves later,

732
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,910
let him pass.

733
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,280
Yes.

734
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,630
Also,

735
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,230
pass on my verbal instruction to the Imperial Guards.

736
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,870
When I leave for the capital city,

737
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,430
send a battalion

738
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,600
to guard this place.

739
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,560
From now on,

740
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
no one shall

741
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,670
get near this residence.

742
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,080
Yes.

743
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,950
You're lucky that you're still alive.

744
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,630
You should know that martial arts master above the Ninth Dan

745
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,840
can hear another man's breath

746
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,080
through the wall.

747
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,910
They can figure out my position

748
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,000
by my voice,

749
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,630
and then they'll shoot you.

750
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,870
Distinguishing location by breaths through the wall,

751
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,600
it doesn't make sense.

752
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,760
They're beyond common sense.

753
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,100
In the river of history,

754
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,300
time goes round and round.

755
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,660
Memories about the former and present lives

756
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,540
join each other in an endless way.

757
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,140
In the long drunken Milky Way,

758
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,860
one season follows another in a flash,

759
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,060
and the wild geese are flying south.

760
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,980
I just can't give up

761
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,980
to be with you for my whole life.

762
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,260
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

763
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,060
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

764
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,940
Year after year in the wandering,

765
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,500
I count the remaining years.

766
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,700
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

767
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,260
even though we have ended up the destiny,

768
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,940
I never feel regretful.

769
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,900
In such a chaotic world,

770
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,660
I still miss you as ever.

771
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,300
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

772
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,020
With a gentle heart,

773
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,580
I cherish our remaining years.

774
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,420
Even though we have to go through

775
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,380
all the hardships along the journey,

776
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:21,700
you always stay by my side,

777
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,460
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

778
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,380
Year after year in the wandering,

779
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,740
I count the remaining years.

780
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,100
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

781
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,900
even though we end up the destiny,

782
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,340
I never feel regretful.

783
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,260
In such a chaotic world,

784
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,220
I still miss you as ever.

785
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,900
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

786
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,660
With a gentle heart,

787
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,060
I cherish our remaining years.

788
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,860
Even though we have to go through

789
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,020
all the hardships along the journey,

790
00:44:53,540 --> 00:45:02,300
you always stay by my side...
