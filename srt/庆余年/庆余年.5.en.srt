17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,020
Your case files were all take away by the Inspection and Control Bureau.

18
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,210
The only thing that's left

19
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,140
is this wanted notice.

20
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,640
Your crime was written on it.

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,360
You were accused of the assassination of an important official.

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,020
It's so strange that

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,090
the Inspection and Control Bureau would

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,260
take you. And why would you come to find me?

25
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,390
To do your old business?

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,820
- You have the pass of the prosecutor of the Inspection and Control Bureau?
- Yes.

27
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,750
- Are you going to the Inspection and Control Bureau?
- I will.

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,610
What do you mean?

29
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,900
There are the case files stored in the Inspection and Control Bureau.

30
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,920
If you give me one of the unimportant case files,

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,230
my life will be yours.

32
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,790
From now on, I will be your servant.

33
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,110
You will control my life and death.

34
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,530
I don't want to.

35
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,040
If it's not because I have no other way, I wouldn't kneel in front of you like this.

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,720
I know that.

37
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,770
I don't have any last dignity for a human, right now.

38
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,860
Don't push me.

39
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,690
I might do anything.

40
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,850
I believe that.

41
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,220
I swear. That case file is not top secret.

42
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,410
You are the prosecutor. It will be easy for you to get it and there won't be any repercussions.

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,280
Let me say it again.

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,580
I don't want to.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,080
If I help you, there is another condition.

46
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,080
Tell me. What's on that file?

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,790
Tell me. Why did you try to kill an important official?

48
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,290
Tell me. Why did you give everything up?

49
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,350
<i>- It was me.
- All these people were?</i>

50
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,250
<i>An old story.</i>

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,100
<i>This ordinary couple poured water on the street and they stained some powerful people's clothes.</i>

52
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,450
<i>They were beaten.</i>

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
<i>Thank you for saving us.</i>

54
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,030
<i>Thank you for saving us.</i>

55
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,750
So you stopped them for some poor people.

56
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,670
It was not their fault. I didn't know who was behind it and I did this to myself.

57
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,110
I don't think that you are wrong.

58
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,460
The master of those guys

59
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,730
is Guo Baokun.

60
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,410
And his father is the minister of the Ministry of Rituals, Guo Youzhi.

61
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,530
A powerful man with a high position. Then?

62
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,920
After a day, I was wanted by the Ministry of Sanctions.

63
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,540
The Ministry of Sanctions sent out documents for a fight?

64
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,590
For the assassination of an important official.

65
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,610
There is no assassination.

66
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,360
How can they set you up without any evidence?

67
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,590
There were witnesses.

68
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,880
People from the Guo family?

69
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,030
That couple.

70
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,360
I was set up and my whole family was sentenced to death.

71
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,440
Your family was involved.

72
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,280
My wife had just gotten pregnant.

73
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,430
I had begged them.

74
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,530
I told them that you could kill me

75
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,670
to save my family's lives. But they told me that

76
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,690
the law is strict and you couldn't disobey it.

77
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,280
I remembered that when I heard it,

78
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,780
I wanted to laugh but I couldn't.

79
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,570
Who saved you?

80
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,210
The Inspection and Control Bureau.

81
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,700
They got me out of prison

82
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,000
and transferred all my files with one condition only.

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,280
As long as I join the Inspection and Control Bureau,

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,870
I can save the lives of my whole family.

85
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,490
They wanted your talent.

86
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,060
But what if I never learned martial arts?

87
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,350
Is my tomb covered with grass now?

88
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,340
That's right.

89
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,310
I'm alive now.

90
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,800
But there are so many people that have died of injustice.

91
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,190
You hate them.

92
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,700
Who?

93
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,920
The son of the minister of the Ministry of Rituals is so high and noble. I'm lucky to be alive.

94
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,120
How dare I to hate him?

95
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,640
That couple.

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,920
After I went to the Inspection and Control Bureau, I did try to find them.

97
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,200
I wanted to beat the hell out of them

98
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,170
to let out the anger in my heart.

99
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,830
Did you?

100
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,490
<i>Give us some money. Give us some food.</i>

101
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,880
<i>Are you tired? You are sweating a lot.</i>

102
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,830
<i>Lady, give us some food. Lady!</i>

103
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,400
<i>That is a poor child.</i>

104
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,160
<i>Give me some money, Master.</i>

105
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,370
<i>Give him some then.</i>

106
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,920
<i>- Thank you!
- There is no need.</i>

107
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,500
<i>Let's go.</i>

108
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,880
<i>Thank you, Master.</i>

109
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,570
<i>- It's hard for everybody.
- Right.</i>

110
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,840
<i>Master, give me some money.</i>

111
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,370
<i>Give me some food.</i>

112
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,300
<i>Please!</i>

113
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,250
<i>Master, give me some money.</i>

114
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,360
<i>Give me some food.</i>

115
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,340
<i>Please! Lady, give me some food.</i>

116
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,490
<i>Please. Kind people–</i>

117
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,360
<i>Thank you, Master.</i>

118
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,070
They were just ordinary people.

119
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,350
They were asked by the minister to be the witnesses.

120
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,360
What could they do?

121
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,990
From that thing, I understood.

122
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,360
In this world,

123
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,040
there is no black or white. There is only noble and lowly.

124
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,260
I was thinking about taking my wife and son out of the capital.

125
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,560
Secretly live this life.

126
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,300
So you wanted to use me to fake your death.

127
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,570
You don't want to stay in the Inspection and Control Bureau.

128
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,740
I had gone back to my home.

129
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,030
My home was empty. My family is missing.

130
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,860
I'm now dead. I can't look it up.

131
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,830
And the people that I can trust

132
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,310
is only you, Fan Xian.

133
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,690
So, this is the reason that you want to look for the case file in the Inspection and Control Bureau.

134
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,940
A trace of my family.

135
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,380
The Inspection and Control Bureau must have a record.

136
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,580
If you can find them for me,

137
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,590
you will own my life.

138
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,980
I don't want your life.

139
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,130
But I will help you.

140
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,030
You could have, but you didn't do anything to that couple.

141
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,230
You said that your heart is cold.

142
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,360
It's not.

143
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,970
That's the reason that I will help you.

144
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,290
<i>[Martial Arts Hall]</i>

145
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
Let's go.

146
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,540
<i>[Lucky Yard]</i>

147
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,620
Lady, please drink this medicine.

148
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,170
<i>Wan'er!</i>

149
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,800
I will buy you chicken drumsticks today!

150
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,110
Lady! Lady! Be careful of the wind!

151
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,870
Lady!

152
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,100
Didn't you promise me to keep it a secret?

153
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,600
Why are you yelling like this?

154
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,320
We don't have to keep any secret from now on.

155
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,400
Chicken drumsticks, pig feet, whatever.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,070
You can eat whatever you want. Why are you still standing here?

157
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,260
Take him to the back kitchen to get ready.

158
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,840
Go!

159
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,850
Heroine Ye, what new things did you bring today?

160
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,250
I went out of town yesterday to watch the knife trick.

161
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,000
I heard that there is a chef in the countryside

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,150
that can use beans and vegetables to make the flavor of all kinds of meat.

163
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,790
They are not only delicious but also look alike.

164
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,610
I have brought him to cook for you.

165
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,230
- You are so sweet.
- Of course.

166
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,310
From now on, if you want to eat meat,

167
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,920
I will bring him here.

168
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,630
I have the fate of a maid with the body of a lady.

169
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,520
It takes so much effort for me to eat meat.

170
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,350
How is it? Are you okay?

171
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,870
Why are you coughing blood again?

172
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,980
Did you get a cold yesterday at the Temple of Qing?

173
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,520
I'm okay. I'm really okay.

174
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,440
Tell me. Will there be a day...

175
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,840
that after all the throwing up, I get used to it?

176
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,100
What the hell are you talking about? Get used to it?

177
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,690
<i>Are you an assassin?</i>

178
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,080
<i>I don't think so.</i>

179
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
<i>Then, did a fairy send you?</i>

180
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,740
<i>I don't think so either.</i>

181
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
<i>I think you are.</i>

182
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,430
<i>It's okay. After all the throwing up, you will get used to it.</i>

183
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,880
When I go out of town in another day,

184
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,580
I will find a famous doctor that's hiding to cure you.

185
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,030
Even if I'm cured now,

186
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,560
I won't be happy.

187
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,620
Are you still thinking about the marriage?

188
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,310
I know my body.

189
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,560
I can die at any time.

190
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,530
Why do I have to be involved in an engagement?

191
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,500
Don't say things like that!

192
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,880
Don't say that about yourself for a bastard.

193
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,790
He is a bastard and I'm a bastard. What's the difference?

194
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,320
You are a princess.

195
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,780
You are like Heaven and Earth compared with them.

196
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,320
I grew up hiding in my life.

197
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,880
My princess's identity is false.

198
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,630
What if I am a princess? I want to find someone that my true heart goes to,

199
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,410
but I can't make my own decision.

200
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,540
If somebody else makes you unhappy,

201
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,920
I can go and beat him to make you happy.

202
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,740
But this–

203
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,640
Although I'm weak, my heart is strong.

204
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,290
To marry me, the order of the emperor is not enough.

205
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,970
It's not okay to get the Inside Treasury through me.

206
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,720
The one that I'm going to marry has one condition only.

207
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,710
What condition?

208
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,810
I need to like him.

209
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,220
Wan'er, what you just said is so good!

210
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,800
Right! Like! I need to find someone that I like, too.

211
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,580
We are just talking after all.

212
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,330
How is that hard?

213
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,760
Wait! Where are we going?

214
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,210
It's just Fan Xian. We'll find him and talk to him about it!

215
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,150
Let him determine his worth and ask the emperor to take back his order.

216
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,430
Lady! Where are you going? You can't get cold again.

217
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,310
To retract the engagement of Your Lady!

218
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,260
Lady!

219
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,490
Eat some.

220
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,970
No. I don't want to.

221
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,890
I have something. Let him stop the cart.

222
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,900
I'll go down.

223
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,540
What is it? Why are you rushing?

224
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,910
I don't know. I–

225
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,970
<i>Stop!</i>

226
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,810
<i>Let that bastard from Danzhou get out of the cart!</i>

227
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,030
<i>Come out!</i>

228
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,170
I'll take a look.

229
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,010
It's okay. Don't worry. Sit.

230
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,080
Did you hear me? Get out!

231
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,610
Brother!

232
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,750
It's okay.

233
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,180
Okay. Let's take a look.

234
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,000
They tried to beat him and got beaten instead.

235
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,270
- Young Master! Young Master, you need to be responsible for us!
- Don't come here! Get out!

236
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,480
Who is responsible for you?

237
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,440
- Young Master!
- Shut up!

238
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,390
Do you know them?

239
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,660
I don't. Do you?

240
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,780
I don't know them either. Nobody does.

241
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,340
- Young Master!
- Who is your young master! Shut up!

242
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,490
They are talking nonsense.

243
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,990
I don't know where they come from.

244
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,530
Why are they calling young master like that?

245
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,990
I have a solid relationship with my brother.

246
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,470
You little thugs! Don't try to break us!

247
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,980
Your Majesty, Fan Xian went out together with the son of the Earl of Sinan.

248
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,030
They went to Yishiju.

249
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,050
Also, on the crown prince's side,

250
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,690
somebody is watching Fan Xian.

251
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,720
Other than that, guests of the second prince are following him privately. <i>[Eunuch Hou: Qing Emperor's Personal Eunuch]</i>

252
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,910
Fan Xian has no position. Should we protect him?

253
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:56,090
He is taking over the Inside Treasury after all. And you have picked him.

254
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,130
How many fish are in this pool?

255
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,670
This... I don't know.

256
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,040
The water is too deep and you can't see, right?

257
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,160
How about now?

258
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,490
The fish food in Your Majesty's hand

259
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,760
is Fan Xian. The water is the capital.

260
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,770
The fish–

261
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,080
are everybody.

262
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,710
<i>[Yishiju]</i>

263
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,940
<i>Gentlemen, watch your steps.</i>

264
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,670
You go park the cart. We'll wait for you upstairs.

265
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,150
Go!

266
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,740
This Yishiju is a famous restaurant in the capital. It's very unique.

267
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,830
Since Sizhe is buying for us, this is it then.

268
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,670
Sister, isn't this one a little expensive?

269
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,340
You said that you were buying us lunch. Nobody is pushing you.

270
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,360
Brothe, let's go. See what you want to eat.

271
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,810
- Do you want books?
- What?

272
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,030
Do you want books? Forbidden books?

273
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,210
This sounds so familiar. Do you also sell DVDs?

274
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,040
What DVD? I sell books.

275
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,730
Do you want it or not?

276
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,830
I need to take a look first, don't I?

277
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,830
- "Red Chamber's Dream?"
- Indeed.

278
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,680
This "Red Chamber's Dream" is really a magical book.

279
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,940
It's the newest version. Eight teals for one book and there is no bargain.

280
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,050
How much? Eight teals?

281
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,540
Do you want it or not?

282
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,340
What if I want a lot more?

283
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,030
You are not hiding any more?

284
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,070
If you really want it, come with me to the back alley.

285
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,100
- You guys wait for me upstairs.
- Are you really going?

286
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,360
Please lead the way.

287
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,850
Brother!

288
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,570
Sister, look at him! How unelegant!

289
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,610
What do you know?

290
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,470
Brother wrote that book.

291
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,590
He wrote that book!

292
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,580
Please take your time.

293
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,970
- Did you clean up everything?
- Yes.

294
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,960
Hurry! Guests are waiting upstairs!

295
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,670
Please come this way.

296
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,260
- Let's eat at another restaurant.
- Please come inside.

297
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,700
How far away?

298
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,290
Almost there. You bargain for yourself.

299
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,560
Not with you?

300
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,000
If you want to buy more, you need to talk to the host.

301
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,700
He has all the books.

302
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,220
There he is.

303
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,650
<i>Remember. If any official comes to check you,</i>

304
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,040
<i>- you need to turn around and walk right away. Remember!</i>
- There are so many people getting books from him.

305
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,030
Right. You talk to him yourself. I'm going back to the street.

306
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,010
Do you want this one or not?

307
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,270
Thank you, Young Master.

308
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,030
<i>Then, can you give me one?</i>

309
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,310
<i>Just one?</i>

310
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,550
Remember! Run away when you see any officials.

311
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,350
Go.

312
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,900
But don't run this way.

313
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,490
Do you have all the books?

314
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,670
How many do you want?

315
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,380
- Young Master Fan.
- Wang Qinian.

316
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,380
First a map, then a book.

317
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,700
Are you monopolizing the culture industry?

318
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,370
What is culture industry?

319
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,410
How about we talk about the map first?

320
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,160
Young Master Fan, how about this?

321
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,820
- I will pay you ten times for the map.
- So straightforward.

322
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,170
I always admit what I have done.

323
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,050
I'm bright.

324
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,880
Please look at your back, Young Master.

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,340

326
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,190

I understand.

330
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,840

331
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,720
Fan Xian is not here.

332
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,880
Where to?

333
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,730
He went to the restaurant.

334
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,290
He is happy and unrestrained!

Are you okay?

337
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,900
You can tell Mrs. Liu in the family about the engagement retraction.

338
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,240
The emperor has arranged our marriage without my agreement.

339
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,380
I'm not happy about it.

340
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,390
You shouldn't do things to others if you don't want it yourself.

341
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,260
If I want to withdraw the engagement,

342
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,220
I should look at him in the eye and tell him.

343
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,680
I will help you.

344
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,520

What are you looking at?

355
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,040
There are a lot of people who are selling books.

356
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,190
Take a look! It's the same.

357
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,720
Take a look!

358
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,230
It's the most popular

359
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,690
book right now. Do you want one?

360
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,720
Why are there so many people that are holding babies?

361
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,350
Wang Qianian is good. He is a friend of women.

362
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,540
Fan Xian, did you really write this book?

363
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,140
It's not me.

364
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,900
It's Cao Xueqin! Mr. Cao's Red Chamber's Dream.

365
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,240
Brother, don't hide it. There is no such person in this world.

366
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,180
It's really not me. It's such a great book.

367
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,430
How can I steal it and call myself the author?

368
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,480
I just recite this book.

369
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,680
All in all, what happens next?

370
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,120
- Are you the only one that knows it?
- What?

371
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,480
Fan Xian, the sale of this book,

372
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,670
we can do it!

373
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,490
Fan Sizhe, don't mess things up.

374
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,260
I won't, Sister.

375
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,830
I was having a close look. There are a lot of people who are buying this book.

376
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,930
It's eight taels of silver for one book!

377
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,180
Look at this book. It's so normal.

378
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,030
Printing and publishing are less than three maces and two candareens.

379
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,350
If we don't count human labor, by selling one book,

380
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,990
we can earn seven taels, six maces, and eight candareens.

381
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,300
Eight or nine books were sold in that short period of time.

382
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,620
If we have more people, we can sell more than a hundred in a day.

383
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,790
One hundred books! We can earn 768 taels.

384
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,940
If we control the time and publish one in 15 days,

385
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,140
that would be 11,520 taels.

386
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,390
Other than labor, let's say 30%,

387
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,550
we can still get 8064 taels of profit.

388
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,140
You can publish twelve books,

389
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,020
and that would be 96,768 taels.

390
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,650
And that's just the first version. There is so much to earn, Fan Xian!

391
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,710
What do you call him?

392
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,500
Brother. My dear brother. If you let me do this,

393
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,560
not only brother. I'm willing to call you... uncle.

394
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,250
What do you think? We can cooperate. You write the book and I set up the store.

395
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,900
We divide by 40% and 60%. I take 40% and you take 60%.

396
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,350
In that way, every 15 days,

397
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,230
you can get 4,836 taels and 4 maces of silver.

398
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,700
What do you think?

399
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,330
How did you calculate all that?

400
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,940
Do you need to calculate it?

401
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,960
Isn't it very simple?

402
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,530
<i>Get out of the way! Out of the way!</i>

403
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,950
<i>You are forbidden to sell it!</i>

404
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,510
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

405
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,700
<i>Who has asked you to sell this book? Get out of the way!</i>

406
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,020
<i>Don't sell it! Get out!</i>

407
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,400
<i>What are you doing?</i>

408
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,940
<i>Who has asked you to sell it!</i>

409
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,560
<i>Get away!</i>

410
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,110
Young Master, we have driven away everybody.

411
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,100
<i>[Guo Baokun: the son of the minister of the Ministry of Rituals, Guo Youzhi]</i>

412
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,920
Animal!

413
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,140
This is Guo Baokun.

414
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,640
The Ministry of Rituals' minister's son.

415
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,150
What is he doing?

416
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,340
-  Is he the one that destroyed your family?
- Yes.

417
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,090
Should we find a way to beat him up?

418
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,400
I have only one life right now. I don't want to make a mistake again.

419
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,220
Everybody! I, Guo Baokun,

420
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,160
my father is the minister of the Ministry of Rituals. I'm not that talented,

421
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,520
but I am writing for the palace.

422
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,530
I have been reading and studying articles since I was a child and rituals are what I respect the most.

423
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,460
You are all scholars and you should read traditional saint's books.

424
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,810
This kind of dirty book is an insult to you.

425
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,860
<i>[Red Chamber's Dream]</i>

426
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,580
I think that from today,

427
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,890
we should forbid this book.

428
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,990
Nonsense. Guo Baokun, you are talking nonsense!

429
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,640
Which son is talking crazy?

430
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm your grandfather!

431
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,470
Who is Guo Baokun's friend?

432
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,220
He used to study with the crown prince. He is on Crown Prince's side.

433
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,940
Crown Prince again.

434
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,630
Does it have anything to do with Crown Prince?

435
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,590
When he was talking, he was looking at me. He knows that I'm here.

436
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,000
Since it's for you, why is he so excited?

437
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,210
Right. Does Fan Sizhe have a history with Guo Baokun?

438
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,410
I haven't heard of it.

439
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,490
That guy with the last name Guo! What do you know!

440
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,220
So many people like to read this book.

441
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,670
It means that this book is a good book.

442
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,370
And you want to forbid it.

443
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,860
What's your position?

444
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,260
A writer for the palace! It's a small position!

445
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,680
Do you dare to go into the court?

446
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,110
I was thinking which family is this stupid guy from.

447
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,470
It's you, the stupid pig.

448
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,550
You are the pig! Your dad is the pig of the Ministry of Rituals!

449
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,610
- Don't be mad, Young Master Guo.
- How dare you–

450
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,820
<i>[Jia Zongwei: Southern Qing Jingdu Scholar]</i>

451
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,300
<i>[Jia Zongwei: Southern Qing Jingdu Scholar]</i>
I heard that Young Master Guo is very talented.

452
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,370
You have come from a family with a rich history. I didn't believe it.

453
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:38,320
Today, I see Young Master Guo telling right and wrong for the scholars in the world.

454
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,880
I respect you so much.

455
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,230
In the capital, this He Zongwei

456
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,830
is pretty talented.

457
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,640
He is looking for a master.

458
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,620
I have heard of Young Master He's talent for a long time.

459
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,370
Don't praise me like that, Young Master Guo.

460
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,150
They are all nonsense!

461
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,200
You are not elegant.

462
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,340
This is the son of the Earl of Sinan.

463
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,620
The Earl of Sinan is in the Ministry of Revenue and he is in charge of the money.

464
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,560
So his son is supposed to be shallow.

465
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,280
How dare you insult my dad!

466
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,310
It's okay. Guo Baokun doesn't know me.

467
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,330
I'm afraid that his underlings might recognize you. Don't show yourself.

468
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,030
Then, what should we do? Watching your brother get beaten?

469
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,180
Let me go!

470
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,970
We are all officials. If you get down on your knee and apologize to me,

471
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,020
for the face of your dad, I will let you go.

472
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,190
Young Master, I won't say sorry to a pig!

473
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,390
Kick him harder on the ground.

474
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,830
It's the bastard of the Earl of Sinan in Danzhou.

475
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,550
Miss Ruoruo,

476
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,320
although Miss Rourou has talent,

477
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,350
she has such loser brothers.

478
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,740
It's such a pity.

479
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,580
You are wrong. I'm just passing by.

480
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,780
What are you doing?

481
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,720
Are you feeling ashamed?

482
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,190
Fan Xian, why are you unwilling to admit who you are?

483
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,090
I never thought that you admired me so much.

484
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,820
Nonsense! Ad–

485
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,000
I arrived in the capital yesterday and it's the first day that I came to the street. I haven't even recognized everybody in my family.

486
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,050
You can tell that it's me with one look and you remember my name so clearly.

487
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,410
Have you admired me for a long time?

488
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,160
You–

489
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,100
Don't say things if you can't say it. It's so embarrassing.

490
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,470
Let's talk about just then. If I didn't come down,

491
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,230
and he breaks one of his arms...

492
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,530
So? Then what?

493
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,860
Why are you staring? Go!

494
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,620
It's just a bastard. Why are you afraid?

495
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,360
If you break his arm,

496
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,690
I will break your nose. It's fair.

497
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,490
A loser from a village who doesn't know anything.

498
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,690
Why are you looking at me? Beat him up.

499
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,790
I'll be responsible if he is hurt.

500
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,120
Dominating Qi!

501
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,460
Good hit!

502
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,630
What do you want?

503
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,500
Beat him up as well!

504
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,910
You just said that this book is cheesy and obscene.

505
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,520
I said it. So what?

506
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,880
Have you read it?

507
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,670
I don't even have time to read all the saints' books.

508
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,110
How can I have time to read things like this?

509
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,760
Then, have you read it?

510
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,080
I don't want to make my eyes dirty.

511
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,430
You have never read this book and you criticize it.

512
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,560
The writer of this book is a nobody.

513
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,000
- What kind of good articles can he write?
- Are you reading the article or the fame?

514
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,290
If he is not famous, he can't write a good book?

515
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,600
If you don't study, you can't get a broad knowledge. If you don't have a will, you can't study well.

516
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,820
You are so shallow and you call yourself a scholar.

517
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,310
And you talk about will.

518
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:37,230
You don't have the respect to face other people's articles. Did your articles go into a dog's belly?

519
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,380
Nonsense!

520
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,350
How can you village people judge scholars like this?

521
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,140
Straighten your tongue before you talk!

522
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,920
If all the scholars are like you guys, I don't want to be a part of it.

523
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,060
Well said!

524
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,800
<i>What Young Master Fan said is really great.</i>

525
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,750
Your Highness.

526
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,000
- Your Highness.
- If you don't study, you can't get a broad knowledge.

527
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,740
If you don't have a will, you can't study well.

528
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,580
I think about these two sentences and they mean a lot.

529
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,320
You can see the talent of Young Master Fan from it.

530
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,330
Your Highness, you can't be tricked by this person.

531
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,920
Young Master Guo and Mr. He are known for your talent.

532
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,730
It happens that there is going to be a poetry gathering in my place tomorrow.

533
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,380
You should make friends through articles and get pleasure from writing poetry,

534
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,550
and fight with poets at the gathering.

535
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,760
So the scholars in the world can see

536
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,750
who is really talented. How is it?

537
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,530
- I will be there.
- I'll be there.

538
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,940
Who are you?

539
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,810
This is the son of the Prince of Jin, His Highness Li Hongcheng.

540
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,190
- Who is the Prince of Jin?
- Don't yell.

541
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,330
The Prince of Jin is the brother of the emperor.

542
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,410
Royal family.

543
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,230
Talent is the basis of people. Blood is nothing worth mentioning.

544
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,770
You have a good attitude.

545
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,570
Honestly, will there be girls at the poets' gathering?

546
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,370
There will be quite a few talented ladies.

547
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,430
You are good! You are fishing for artistic girls with such a formal gathering.

548
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,570
What does "fish" mean?

549
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,200
It's a deal then. See you tomorrow at the gathering.

550
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,600
Okay. Hongcheng will be waiting.

551
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,550
Son of the Prince of Jin, Li Hongcheng, has a good reputation.

552
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,740
He likes articles and holds poetry gatherings a lot.

553
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,670
Young masters from famous families always attend.

554
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,510
I never thought that Brother would agree.

555
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,200
I thought you looked down at things like that.

556
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,350
You can't hide it.

557
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,300
Why?

558
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,900
It's just a meal. And the followers of the crown prince and the son of the Prince of Jin both appeared.

559
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,200
And inviting a bastard that just got to the capital to the poets gathering

560
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,670
for one or two sentences. It's too careless.

561
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,190
Brother, you don't think that it's a coincidence.

562
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,270
He was waiting for me in Yishiju.

563
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,800
Don't think of nonsense like that.

564
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,940
He is the son of the Prince of Jin.

565
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,720
Why does he have to wait for you?

566
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,940
Also, who can expect that you will be in Yishiju today?

567
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,540
It's easy to find the destination if he follows the cart.

568
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,630
So he sent somebody to wait for you in front of our house?

569
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,470
Just to meet you? And invite you to the gathering?

570
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,700
Is it possible? Nonsense.

571
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,900
About right.

572
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,630
What about Guo Baokun then?

573
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,690
Crown Prince sent Guo Baokun?

574
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,390
Crown Prince wants to meet you,

575
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,220
and the son of the Prince of Jin wants to see you.

576
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,090
Why can't I see that you are so popular?

577
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,520
You should ask them then.

578
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,700
Don't think about nonsense like that.

579
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,860
There are a lot of people who are recently liking this book.

580
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,340
It's a magical book. There is no book like that in the world.

581
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,800
That Fan Xian is quite sincere.

582
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,990
He is very interesting. Not ordinary.

583
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,640
It's rare for a son of famous families in the capital that can get praise from you like this.

584
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,690
Do you want to meet him tomorrow?

585
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,720
Let's wait.

586
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,370
Let's see.

587
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,000
Okay.

588
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,330
What?

589
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,240
Why did you go downstairs?

590
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,330
Didn't you hear him abuse the book that you wrote?

591
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,300
I was not mad. Why were you?

592
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,750
We are cooperating to sell the book and he wants to ban it.

593
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,490
Stopping me from making money is like killing my parents.

594
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,640
Who has promised to work with you?

595
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,080
Are you really not thinking about it? The profit is a lot.

596
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,990
I can't see how you did the math so fast.

597
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,210
Just ordinary. This is not important.

598
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,730
Think about it. Are we cooperating or not?

599
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,170
Why do you want to sell books?

600
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,040
To earn money. Do you need to think about it?

601
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,850
Then, why do you want to make money?

602
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,500
What do you mean?

603
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,780
Do you want to buy expensive things with the money you earn,

604
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,500
or are you going to a casino or a whore house?

605
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,700
I have never thought of that. I just like to earn money.

606
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,020
Don't look at me like that.

607
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,600
You agree, don't you?

608
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,530
Then, you need to do me a favor.

609
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,290
What favor?

610
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,480
<i>There is nobody here. We can get off the cart.</i>

611
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,760
What do you mean?

612
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,780
Take the cart back home.

613
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,280
Don't let anyone know that I have left.

614
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,380
Where are you going?

615
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,880
If you keep asking, I won't let you sell my book.

616
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,870
There is no use to you threatening me.

617
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,980
My sister is sitting here. She is afraid of lying the most.

618
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,360
Of course, she won't help you. Right, sister?

619
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,160
Brother, you go ahead. Don't worry.

620
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,370
I'll keep an eye on him to stop him from gossiping around.

621
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,770
This–

622
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,220
Don't gossip.

623
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,670
Sister, why are you treating him totally different from treating me?

624
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,410
Turn left at the crossroad. Walk east until Tian He Street.

625
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,250
You will see the Inspection and Control Bureau there.

626
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,160
You send them back home. I can find it myself.

627
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,400
You are the prosecutor of the Inspection and Control Bureau. Do you need to sneak in?

628
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,150
I won't let others know about the prosecutor.

629
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,000
The case file of your family is 534 of category No.4, right?

630
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,240
- Right.
- Wait for the good news.

631
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,480
Think about where the bookstore should be.

632
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,360
We can talk about it when I get back.

633
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,100
You agree!

634
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,520
Don't let others see.

635
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,450
I'll be rich.

636
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,280
<i>Sugar-coated haws!</i>

637
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,880
<i>Sugar-coated haws!</i>

638
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,920
<i>Sugar-coated haws!</i>

639
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,700
<i>Sugar-coated haws!</i>

640
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,910
<i>Sugar-coated haws!</i>

641
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,320
Okay, Young Master.

642
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,990
<i>Sugar-coated haws!</i>

643
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,860
<i>Sugar-coated haws!</i>

644
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,110
We need to pick the location for the store.

645
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,020
We also need to pick the paper.

646
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,170
And the private ones selling outside,

647
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,840
we need to retract them to avoid them from affecting my selling.

648
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,720
And I need to prepare for all these things.

649
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,000
We are not there yet.

650
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,670
There is a traffic jam.

651
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,330
We can just withdraw and let them pass.

652
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,650
Okay.

653
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,560
Miss Fan! Please wait.

654
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,380
- Who is it?
- That noisy one in the Ye family.

655
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,160
I remember it! Every new year

656
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,150
she sends you two big cases of jewelry.

657
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,530
Not her.

658
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,360
It's the daughter of the head of guards of the capital, Ye family's Ye Ling'er.

659
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,410
Then you can just tell her to go.

660
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,390
Ye Ling'er is okay.

661
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,090
I think there is someone who is with her.

662
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,270
Who did you see?

663
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,530
It's the cart of the Fan family!

♫ <i>It's a cold world</i> ♫

694
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,190
♫ <i>And I think of you as I did before ♫ <i></i></i>

695
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,180
♫ <i>The moon is sleepless</i> ♫

696
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,410
♫ <i>Leave a warm heart</i> ♫

697
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,080
♫ <i>To look after the rest of the year</i> ♫

698
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,630
♫ <i>Even if I have to cross a thousand mountains</i> ♫

699
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,250
♫ <i>and through the fire of war</i> ♫

700
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:18,900
♫ <i>You are always there for me</i> ♫
