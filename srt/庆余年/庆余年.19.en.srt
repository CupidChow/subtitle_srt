1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 19

16
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,950
I have nothing to do with Lin Gong's death.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,950
Why do they want to see me?

18
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,360
you'll figure that out after seeing them.

20
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,830
Then who should I see first?

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,830
Prime Minister Lin Ruofu

22
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,270
and the Crown Prince are not on the same side.

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,550
Whoever you choose to see first,

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,040
you'll offend the other one.

25
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,510
Young Master Fan Xian,

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,680
the imperial guards are here.

27
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,480
His Majesty ordered to see you
through a verbal instruction.

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,440
Now you don't have to choose.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,470
Hurry up! Don't keep His Majesty waiting.

30
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,110
They have to meet after all.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,360
Mr. Fan, come with me.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,240
His Majesty is waiting for you.

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,520
It's you again.

34
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,000
It must be fate.

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,830
Please.

36
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,520
Eunuch Hou and I

37
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,750
are somewhat connected.

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
For my trial of beating Guo Baokun,

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,960
you came to my rescue in the court of

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,470
the Prefecture of Capital City.

41
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,600
When I first arrived in the capital city,

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,960
you were the one who drove my carriage.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,670
That is to say,

44
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,320
you sent me to the Qing Temple

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,630
on purpose.

46
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,110
Mr. Fan,

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,470
I've no idea

48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,160
what you're talking about.

49
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
That's fine. I'll remember everything in heart.

50
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,550
Eunuch Hou, this is for you to buy some tea.

51
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,240
No! No!

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,160
What are you doing?

53
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,600
Madam Liu Ruyu of your family

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,000
is a descendant of the Duke,

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
and she used to visit the imperial palace frequently.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,320
I kind of watched her grow up.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,750
We are kind of related.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,670
How can I exploit a younger member of the family?

59
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,830
I didn't know you're so connected

60
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,880
with my family.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,360
Then as a younger member,

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,670
I definitely should pay my respect.

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,390
Well...

64
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,750
It's not much.

65
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,470
No.

66
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,360
Well...

67
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm so flattered.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,080
Paying respect to rites and
carrying forward illustrious virtues,

69
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,270
plus outstanding poetry talents,

70
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,960
no wonder His Majesty often mentions you.

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,520
Really?

72
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,190
His Majesty really likes

73
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,910
your seven-syllable poem with the line

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,750
“A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight.”

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
May I ask

76
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,910
when His Majesty asked about me today,

77
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,910
was he happy or angry?

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,470
He looked calm

79
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,070
with no sign of anger.

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,670
Thanks for telling me.

81
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,110
In that case,

82
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,760
I'll tell you something else.

83
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,390
His Majesty loves to make bows and arrows.

84
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,790
Never touch

85
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,510
those stuff.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,640
How come there's someone

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,110
walking the high walls in the imperial palace?

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,670
No one here dares do that

89
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,350
for sure.

90
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,720
Eunuch, I've seen that.

91
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,950
He might be an assassinator.

92
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,760
Please.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Assassinator?

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,230
Who will he assassinate?

95
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,440
His Majesty, of course.

96
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,230
Then should we call out for help?

97
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,350
No need to worry.

98
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,390
It's improper to call out loud.

99
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,270
Then won't His Majesty be in danger?

100
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,670
Don't worry. He won't be able to touch him.

101
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,390
You look so composed.

102
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,600
Assassination happens occasionally these years.

103
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm used to it.

104
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,070
Occasionally?

105
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,760
Now Nanqing is the most powerful.

106
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Beiqi and Dongyi Town

107
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,480
fear His Majesty deeply.

108
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,070
It's common for them to send assassinators.

109
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
It's you!

110
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
You really don't know who I am?

111
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Whoever you are,

112
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,550
don't step into

113
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,920
the main hall.

114
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,720
His Majesty is in the Imperial Study.

115
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,550
So His Majesty was the one
who worshipped in the Qing Temple.

116
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,320
The man just died is the assassinator.

117
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,160
I told you

118
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,200
no need to make a fuss.

119
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,760
Eunuch Hou,

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,880
who's that man in armor?

121
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,830
That is Gong Dian,

122
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,320
Deputy Director of

123
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,720
Imperial Guards

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,920
and Imperial Bodyguard.

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,510
Have you met him before?

126
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,000
I hit him by palm at the Qing Temple.

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,320
Gong Dian is a martial arts master well above the Eighth Dan.

128
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,480
Mr. Fan, you're really outstanding at such a young age.

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,600
Eunuch Hou,

130
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,950
does Gong Dian

131
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,790
have any friends?

132
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,000
Of course he does.

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,160
What's wrong?

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,830
Then don't they all have to

135
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,200
call him Laogong?
(Laogong is homophone for husband in Chinese.)

136
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,600
He's really good at taking advantage of others!

137
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,640
Mr. Fan, when you go inside,

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
do remember to keep you head down.

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,270
Don't look straight at His Majesty.

140
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,830
Do feel relieved. I understand it all.

141
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,670
Look, you're wrong again.

142
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,340
=Imperial Study=

143
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720
Mr. Fan, please go inside.

144
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,270
Mr. Fan,

145
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,200
His Majesty asks you to wait here.

146
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,640
OK.

147
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,110
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,910
Your Majesty, I'm waiting outside.

149
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,710
Your Majesty.

150
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,280
Kneel down.

151
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,470
Where should I kneel?

152
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,110
Your Majesty, should I kneel down?

153
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Do you want to kneel down?

154
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,440
Not really.

155
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,200
Then you don't have to.

156
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,710
Thanks, Your Majesty.

157
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,520
Your Majesty, I wonder

158
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,110
why you ordered to see me today.

159
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,590
Have you seen the assassinator

160
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,000
at the door?

161
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,640
Yes, I have.

162
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,910
But I don't know him.

163
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,590
I have nothing to do with him.

164
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,840
Eunuch Hou, tell him.

165
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,960
The assassinator was from Beiqi.

166
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,790
The first day he arrived in the capital city,

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,960
the Investigator's Office reported his name

168
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,520
to His Majesty.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
He formed the idea of assassination

170
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,710
in last October.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
In the following months,

172
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
six people consecutively beat around the bush

173
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,110
and strengthened his conviction.

174
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,110
Finally, he made up his mind

175
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,000
to come to the capital city for assassination.

176
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,230
How can you figure out that?

177
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,470
The six people are secret agents of Nanqing.

178
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,760
Then who sent them?

179
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,150
I gave the order.

180
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,880
The Investigator's Office sent them.

181
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,030
So

182
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,550
Your Majesty planned the assassination yourself.

183
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,590
I've planned to start the war against Beiqi for a long time.

184
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,550
There must be a reason.

185
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,230
So the assassinator

186
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,200
is the reason for sending troops.

187
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,150
It's just too obvious.

188
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,910
However, the assassination
on the Niulan Street just happened.

189
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,080
You killed Cheng Jushu,

190
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
and interrogated Si Lili at night.

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,590
Beiqi's secret agent lurking in the capital city,

192
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
that is a better reason to start war against Beiqi.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
By killing the murderer and capturing the secret agent alive,

194
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,910
you've rendered great service to the country.

195
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,230
I'll make you the Chief Musician of
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,590
Which rank?

197
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,320
The eighth rank.

198
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,080
It's not high.

199
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,520
Thank His Majesty for his kindness.

200
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,110
Your Majesty, I should kneel down to thank you.

201
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,520
But you just allowed me

202
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,350
to stand on my feet.

203
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,150
Since it was said by Your Majesty,

204
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,400
I can't disobey it.

205
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
So I can't kneel down.

206
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,910
How did Lin Gong die?

207
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,640
I really don't know.

208
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
You have the reason to kill him.

209
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,320
I had no enmity against him.

210
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,470
Why should I kill him?

211
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,760
Lin Gong planned the assassination on the Niulan Street.

212
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,550
It was him!

213
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,000
You interrogated Si Lili at night,

214
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,840
but you didn't

215
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,400
even get the name?!

216
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,910
She really said nothing,

217
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,320
Your Majesty!

218
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,790
The Crown Prince has known about this.

219
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,440
He demands to see you.

220
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm wronged.

221
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,590
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince requests to see you.

222
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,670
Do you want to see him?

223
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,350
Whatever Your Majesty decides.

224
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,200
Your Highness,

225
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,520
His Majesty is meeting the Chief Musician.

226
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,230
He won't see you today.

227
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,880
The Chief Musician?

228
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,440
His Majesty just made Fan Xian

229
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,840
the Chief Musician of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

230
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,470
Thank you, Eunuch Hou.

231
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,640
Your Highness, I'm really flattered.

232
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,760
Your Majesty, I'm leaving.

233
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,280
You Majesty,

234
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,470
the Crown Prince paid the highest respect by kowtowing.

235
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,910
He's always respectful.

236
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,670
Mr. Fan!

237
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,080
Your Majesty, you don't want the Crown Prince to see me?

238
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,470
I don't want to ruin the peace.

239
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,320
When you get out later,

240
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
the Crown Prince will ask to see you.

241
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,710
I won't stop him.

242
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,840
You have to deal with him yourself.

243
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Well, Your Majesty,

244
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,520
the Prime Minister also wanted to see me this morning.

245
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,080
Is he also going to blame me?

246
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,150
The Prime Minister originally

247
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,080
disagreed with your marriage to Wan'er.

248
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,760
Now, he might have changed his mind.

249
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,710
Why?

250
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
You'll know it

251
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
when you see him.

252
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,110
Doesn't the Prime Minister suspect that

253
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm related to the death of his second son?

254
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,910
It was a top secret of

255
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,080
the Investigator's Office to capture Si Lili.

256
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,440
Would the Investigator's Office tell it

257
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,400
to the Crown Prince?

258
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,030
No.

259
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,910
Then how did the Crown Prince get the information?

260
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,910
What do you think?

261
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,790
Can it be that someone of the Investigator's Office

262
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,840
had pledged allegiance to the Crown Prince?

263
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,000
Your Majesty, do you want me to investigate it for you

264
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,230
by telling me this implicitly.

265
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,400
You mean

266
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm suspecting my own son?

267
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,550
Your Majesty, he's not only your son,

268
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,840
but the Crown Prince.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,230
Escort the Chief Musician out.

270
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes.

271
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,670
Chief Musician, this way, please.

272
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,840
Fan Xian.

273
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,350
Since you entered the imperial palace,

274
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,350
you seemed honest and frank,

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,280
but every word you said meant something.

276
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,910
Do you want to impress me

277
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,670
as an outspoken official?

278
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,200
Just leave.

279
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,030
His Majesty is really hard to predict.

280
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,320
To be honest,

281
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,960
I wet my back out of fear

282
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,400
for what His Majesty said last.

283
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,080
Mr. Fan,

284
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,520
I just couldn't stop sweating

285
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,760
out of fear

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
since you

287
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,080
started talking.

288
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,080
In the future,

289
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,960
just mind your words.

290
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,710
Yes. Yes. Yes.

291
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,790
I really should. Let's go.

292
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,080
So in your opinion, who is tipping

293
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,470
the Crown Prince off from the Investigator's Office?

294
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,220
Oh my god.

295
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,150
How dare I

296
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,320
talk about

297
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,440
the Crown Prince?

298
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,960
Just tell me secretly.

299
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,790
I won't tell others.

300
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Then I might as well kneel down.

301
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,640
-Just now... -Fine. Fine. Fine.

302
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I won't ask.

303
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,670
Just stand up!

304
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,960
You're scaring me to death.

305
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,080
What's up?

306
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,840
I want to see His Excellency Zhu Ge,
the Director of the First Division.

307
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,790
Tell me your name.

308
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,440
=Yuan Hongdao, Adviser of Prime Minister Lin Ruofu=

309
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,280
=Yuan Hongdao, Adviser of Prime Minister Lin Ruofu=
Yuan Hongdao.

310
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,710
Wait!

311
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,910
Can I wait inside?

312
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,790
Then I'll have to examine

313
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,960
your personal belongings first.

314
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,070
What are these?

315
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,430
Please tell His Excellency Zhu Ge that

316
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm waiting for him here.

317
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,350
Tell me why do you want to

318
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,190
see him first.

319
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,350
If I tell you,

320
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm afraid you might lose your life.

321
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,040
You even dare to threaten me!

322
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,160
How dare you!

323
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,830
Don't move.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,760
I won't leave.

325
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,800
Please ask His Excellency Zhu Ge out.

326
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,920
Did you kill Lin Gong?

327
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,110
I didn't.

328
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,190
My tracer friend

329
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,560
and I started off on

330
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,470
the wrong foot.

331
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,400
We wasted so much time that

332
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
we didn't even leave the capital city.

333
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,800
You know our family
is in charge of garrisoning the capital city.

334
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,000
It's easy for me to figure out

335
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,590
whether you left the capital city or not.

336
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,560
Go ahead, please.

337
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Luckily, it's not you.

338
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,920
Or I'll also

339
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,520
be responsible

340
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,470
for Wan'er's brother's death.

341
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,760
You don't usually

342
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,830
wear plain clothes.

343
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,920
Where have you been?

344
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,560
The Lin mansion.

345
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm checking things out for Wan'er.

346
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,230
It's a pity that Lin Gong's body

347
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,520
is still kept in the Investigator's Office.

348
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,590
I hope the Investigator's Office

349
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,800
can find the really killer.

350
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,950
Why are you here?

351
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,590
Lady Ruoruo was worried at home.

352
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
She sent me here to wait for you.

353
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,430
So good you're here.

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,350
I'm going to the Prime Minister's mansion.

355
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,710
Please send a word to Ruoruo for me.

356
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,070
What should I tell her?

357
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,520
Ask her to visit the Crown Prince

358
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,470
in the Eastern Palace.

359
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,160
Tell him I'm going to visit the Prime Minister.

360
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,590
Why?

361
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,470
If the Crown Prince really

362
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,070
instigates Lin Gong to kill me,

363
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,400
he surely doesn't want me to

364
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
reconcile with the Prime Minister.

365
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,830
He might even come to stop me.

366
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,760
But even if he does come to stop you,

367
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,710
how can it do us good?

368
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,560
If he really comes,

369
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,680
then he's overly concerned about this.

370
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,710
Cunning as the Prime Minister,

371
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,470
he will definitely be suspicious.

372
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,000
Your Excellency, you can also make a cunning fox.

373
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,760
Stop it!

374
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,430
I'm a big-tailed wolf.

375
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,640
What is that?

376
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,350
A mystical creature of ancient times.

377
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,110
How come it's you?

378
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,800
Your Excellency!

379
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,230
Excuse me, may I help you?

380
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,430
I'm Fan Xian.

381
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,760
Earlier today,

382
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
the Prime Minister asked to see me.

383
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,590
Brother asked you to tell me this?

384
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,310
Yes.

385
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,310
He went to

386
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,350
the Prime Minister's mansion alone.

387
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,640
According to time, he must have arrived.

388
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,230
OK, Let's go.

389
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,920
Please wait a moment.

390
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,500
=Lin Dabao, eldest Son of Nanqing Prime Minister Lin Ruofu=

391
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,590
Who are you?

392
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,920
Your Highness,

393
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,560
Lady Ruoruo is here.

394
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,590
Fan Ruoruo

395
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,310
pays respects to Your Highness.

396
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,350
Why are you here?

397
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,470
You Highness,

398
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,590
my brother has left the imperial palace.

399
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,110
Now he's in the Prime Minister's mansion.

400
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,830
Go on.

401
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,920
He asked Wang Qinian to pass on the word

402
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,040
that he intended to avoid Your Highness.

403
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,190
And he asked us to cover for him.

404
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,310
If Your Highness leaves now,

405
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,760
you might be able to stop him just in time.

406
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,680
I see.

407
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,110
Your Highness, won't you go to stop him?

408
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,190
No need.

409
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,640
I've told the Prime Minister

410
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,920
everything I know.

411
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,310
Fan Qing is walking right

412
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,350
into the trap.

413
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,800
What will the Prime Minister do?

414
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,400
The Prime Minister

415
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,070
will surely figure out

416
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,470
whether Lin Gong's death is related to Fan Xian or not.

417
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,280
Miss Lili,

418
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,000
it won't take long.

419
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,710
I only need to ask you

420
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,190
one question about Lin Gong.

421
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,470
How was Lin Gong related to me?

422
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,760
No need to cover that up.

423
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,760
Second Young Master Lin Gong planned

424
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,110
the assassination on the Niulan Street.

425
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,000
I've known it all.

426
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,040
Now listen carefully.

427
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,110
My question is

428
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,000
did you tell Fan Xian that

429
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,400
Lin Gong is the real killer

430
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,680
during the night interrogation?

431
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,070
Who are you?

432
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,310
Yuan Hongdao, the adviser of the Prime Minister.

433
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,640
Lin Ruofu sent you to ask me, right?

434
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,190
Please answer me.

435
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,560
No. I didn't tell Fan Xian.

436
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,160
Good.

437
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,800
Next,

438
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,000
I'll test you to see

439
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,950
whether you told the truth or not.

440
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
How?

441
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,190
One by one.

442
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,000
At last,

443
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,520
if your answer

444
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,470
remains the same,

445
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,230
then you've told the truth.

446
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,520
Miss Lili, which one do you want to start from?

447
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,590
I told you the truth.

448
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,310
I didn't tell him about Lin Gong.

449
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,430
I can swear.

450
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,230
Be patient. Be patient.

451
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,040
It will only take a while.

452
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,590
It's a bloodstain left years ago. It can't be wiped clean.

453
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,470
No. I really didn't tell him.

454
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,040
No!

455
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,040
No!

456
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,190
This one! This one!

457
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,920
The one below

458
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,680
is Hong.

459
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,560
This one. This one.

460
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,470
This is Fu Ling.

461
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,680
There is another one.

462
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,040
Jin Xiu! Jin Xiu!

463
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,310
Stop feeding it.

464
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,430
It eats the most every time.

465
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,760
-Jin Xiu. -I see.

466
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,470
Stop eating.

467
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,160
What's your name?

468
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,190
I'm Fan Xian.

469
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Fan Xian?

470
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,950
Are you here to see someone?

471
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,800
What's your name?

472
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,110
My dad said

473
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,640
I should be careful with strangers.

474
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,110
I shouldn't tell them easily that

475
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,590
my name is Dabao.

476
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,040
We've talked

477
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,640
for so long.

478
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm no stranger to you.

479
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,880
That makes sense.

480
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,280
Then I'll tell you.

481
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,160
My name is Dabao.

482
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,160
What a good name!

483
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,000
Right! Right!

484
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,800
My name is good.

485
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,520
But,

486
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,680
Erbao doesn't like it.

487
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,680
He doesn't like it when I call him Erbao.

488
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,110
Is Erbao your younger brother?

489
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,880
Yes.

490
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,640
How do you know that?

491
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
Have you seen him recently?

492
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,920
He hasn't been home all the time.

493
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,000
I miss him.

494
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,400
Does Erbao have another name?

495
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Yes.

496
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,640
He's called Lin Gong.

497
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,310
But, I still feel that

498
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,590
Erbao is better.

499
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,160
Right?

500
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,800
Do you know

501
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,710
when he will come home?

502
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,280
I have so many questions to ask him.

503
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,040
What do you want to ask him?

504
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,070
I'll answer them instead.

505
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,280
Really?

506
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,880
Yes!

507
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,950
I want to ask Erbao

508
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,110
Jin Xiu...

509
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,520
What do I want to ask him?

510
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,560
I want to...

511
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,280
No hurry! No hurry!

512
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,800
Take your time.

513
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,400
I want to ask...

514
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,040
I want to ask him...

515
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,190
Miss Lili, please answer me again.

516
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,920
No.

517
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,430
I didn't tell Fan Xian

518
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,350
about Lin Gong.

519
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,710
Good.

520
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,070
Let's insert the remaining needles

521
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
one by one.

522
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,920
Then we'll add something else.

523
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,560
No!

524
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,470
No!

525
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,760
No!

526
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
No!

527
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,710
Excuse me.

528
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,430
Mr. Yuan?

529
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,190
Yes, I am.

530
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,920
She's a prison of the Investigator's Office.

531
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,190
Didn't His Excellency Zhu Ge

532
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,160
tell you?

533
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,800
I did.

534
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,680
The Prime Minister has obtained

535
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,710
His Majesty's verbal instruction
to ask Si Lili some questions.

536
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Your Excellency, don't you believe me?

537
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,160
I believe you.

538
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,560
But according to the verbal instruction,

539
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,230
you're supposed to ask her

540
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,830
instead of torturing her.

541
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,520
You've made a point.

542
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,190
Mr. Yuan, have you finished asking?

543
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,640
Sort of.

544
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,070
Then, I'll see you out.

545
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,040
Fine.

546
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,070
Mister,

547
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,430
you stuff.

548
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,310
Miss, you can keep it as a souvenir.

549
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,950
No, thanks.

550
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,950
Your Highness, you don't have to.

551
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,560
The tea is good.

552
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,880
It was a gift from Lin Gong.

553
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,950
He used to talk to me

554
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,000
about everything.

555
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,640
I had long heard that the Second Young Master

556
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,520
was a follower of Your Highness.

557
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,710
In your opinion,

558
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,000
should I figure out

559
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
how he was killed?

560
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,070
Your Highness, who do you suspect?

561
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,950
That morning when Lin Gong left the capital city,

562
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,160
he had visited me.

563
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,230
We talked about what happened
in the capital city those days.

564
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,800
I mentioned that

565
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,110
Fan Xian had captured Si Lili in person

566
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,280
and interrogated Si Lili at night

567
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,640
in order to mislead the real killer.

568
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,190
And then?

569
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,280
Then he changed color

570
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,710
and told me

571
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,880
he was the one who planned the assassination
on the Niulan Street.

572
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
He wanted to kill my brother?

573
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,190
Why?

574
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,430
I don't know, either.

575
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,160
He was worried that Fan Xian might found out

576
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,680
his relationship with Si Lili,

577
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,950
so he decided to leave the capital city on the very day

578
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,880
and came back when the whole thing is over.

579
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,230
I just didn't know that

580
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,880
it might be the last time I saw him.

581
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,160
Your Highness,

582
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,640
do you suspect that my brother killed him?

583
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,710
If confirmed that Si Lili

584
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,590
ratted out Lin Gong's name to Fan Xian,

585
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,560
Fan Xian has the motive to kill him.

586
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,830
Your Highness, why don't you ask

587
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,110
Si Lili in person?

588
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,830
I've told all my doubts

589
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,040
to the Prime Minister.

590
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,760
As Lin Gong's father,

591
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,190
it's more appropriate for him

592
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,230
to ask Si Lili.

593
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,760
We can just wait for the news.

594
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,400
The tea is really good!

595
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,230
I know you want to protect the Fan family.

596
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,430
If Fan Xian really did it,

597
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,710
I'll only kill him.

598
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,950
The Fan family won't be involved.

599
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

600
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,280
Your Excellency.

601
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,430
Have you seen Si Lili?

602
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,880
Yes, I've seen her and asked her.

603
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,800
She didn't tell Fan Xian that

604
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
the Second Young Master

605
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,040
planned the assassination.

606
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,950
Did she tell the truth?

607
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
I used some tricks,

608
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
and she didn't change her words.

609
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,110
In your opinion,

610
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,430
why didn't she tell Fan Xian?

611
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,110
A lot of people are involved.

612
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,880
She might want to

613
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,110
trade the secret for her life.

614
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,230
Moreover, when Fan Xian interrogated her,

615
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,280
he was not a government official.

616
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,350
It makes sense that she didn't tell him.

617
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,920
If Fan Xian didn't know about this,

618
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,040
then he has no motive to kill Gong'er.

619
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,400
Exactly.

620
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,280
Mr. Yuan, please go to the Eastern Palace

621
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,400
and inform the Crown Prince of the result.

622
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,590
It's my duty.

623
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,640
Moreover,

624
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,280
as to Fan Xian,

625
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,350
please send a word

626
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,590
to the Crown Prince for me.

627
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
Your Excellency, I'm listening.

628
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,230
Why is the sky blue?

629
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,950
Because the ocean is blue.

630
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,110
Why is the ocean blue?

631
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,520
The sun shines into the ocean,

632
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,280
so the ocean becomes blue.

633
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,950
Then tell me.

634
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,120
Why isn't the water

635
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,280
in the pond blue?

636
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,080
Because the pond water is too shallow.

637
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,080
So it is!

638
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,870
Shallow water doesn't appear to be blue.

639
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,760
Mr. Yuan, good day.

640
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,190
Good day, Dabao.

641
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,320
Mr. Fan, you're really learned.

642
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,630
So admirable!

643
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm just talking nonsense.

644
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,630
Please don't take it seriously.

645
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,800
The Prime Minister is waiting for you in the study.

646
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,280
Where's the study?

647
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I know.

648
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,470
I'll take you there. Let's go.

649
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,120
Dad!

650
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,600
Dad!

651
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,950
I've brought Fan Xian to you.

652
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,180
=Lin Ruofu, Prime Minister of Nanqing=

653
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,560
Dabao,

654
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,710
play outside for a while.

655
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,230
I need a word with him.

656
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,600
Dad,

657
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,360
when will Erbao come home?

658
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,560
Dad, then Dabao will go out.

659
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,560
Dabao had a disease when he was little.

660
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,280
He turned into this after he was recovered.

661
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,230
Having grown up physically,

662
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,710
he's still a kid mentally.

663
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,430
Wan'er can't go back home all the time,

664
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,520
and she's sick with tuberculosis.

665
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,910
Thanks for your treatment,

666
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,670
she is recovering day by day.

667
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,950
It's what I should do.

668
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,840
The future of the Lin family

669
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,910
lied entirely on

670
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,320
Gong'er before.

671
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,630
Shouldering the responsibility of

672
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,390
inheriting the Lin family

673
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,230
since childhood,

674
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,360
he never felt happy,

675
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,630
=All the birds will go to the forest=
but he never complained

676
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,710
the hardship or suffering.

677
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,230
This was written by him when he was little.

678
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,230
Back then,

679
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,910
I often told him that

680
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,430
the civil and military officials of the Six Ministries

681
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,800
are like flocks of birds,

682
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,320
clamoring and quarreling without a stop.

683
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,320
In order to ensure

684
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,630
continuous family inheritance,

685
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,230
we must stick to our roots

686
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,560
among the chaotic birds.

687
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,710
All the birds will go to the forest (Lins).

688
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,910
The Second Young Master wanted to make
a permanent place for the Lin family

689
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,280
in the imperial court.

690
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,190
Though the handwriting is poor,

691
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,630
it shows ambition.

692
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,000
But it sounds arrogant and conceited.

693
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,080
It's common for young people.

694
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,760
These are also written by him when he was little.

695
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,000
Even his handwriting in childhood

696
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,760
is much better than mine.

697
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,870
Since I became an official,

698
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,760
I've gone through three ups and three downs.

699
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,800
Even when I was locked in the death row,

700
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,000
I never felt desperate.

701
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,670
Until I heard of his death

702
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,840
last night.

703
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:52,190
Gong'er is the one who planned
the assassination on Niulan Street.

704
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,080
How could it be him?

705
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,800
Prime Minister, you want to kill me!

706
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,600
I don't know

707
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,000
how I offended you!

708
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,190
It seems you really don't know this.

709
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,150
It's not me who wants to kill you.

710
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,000
He kept the whole thing

711
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,430
from me.

712
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,840
Well.

713
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,560
Then why did the Second Young Master

714
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,080
want to kill me?

715
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,520
I didn't know anything about it

716
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,710
until the Crown Prince sent someone

717
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,520
to tell me this morning.

718
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,950
Is the Crown Prince...

719
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,600
It doesn't matter anymore.

720
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,280
You should marry Wan'er

721
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,280
as soon as possible.

722
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,470
In the future, I'll try my best

723
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,630
to promote you in the officialdom.

724
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,560
The Guo family hates you

725
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,120
for beating Guo Baokun.

726
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,470
I'll protect you from them.

727
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,190
It doesn't matter you're not recorded

728
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,950
in the genealogy of the Fan family.

729
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,560
In the future, all the properties

730
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,670
and connections of the Lin family will be handed over to you.

731
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,870
Your Excellency, I still don't get it.

732
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,120
All these are based on

733
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,320
one condition.

734
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,190
Please tell me.

735
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,600
After I die,

736
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,670
you must protect Wan'er and Dabao,

737
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,560
and protect the Lin family

738
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,520
from political enemies.

739
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,560
Give me your promise,

740
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,190
and the Lin family

741
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,040
will be the strongest support for you

742
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,560
in the capital city.

743
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,840
It's not for trade.

744
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,190
You actually refused me!

745
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,560
I didn't refuse you. It's just not for trade.

746
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,000
Wan'er and I fell in love at first sight.

747
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,080
After meeting and talking with her over and over again,

748
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,840
I've already put her in my heart.

749
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,840
If I marry her,

750
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,120
it's my responsibility

751
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,560
to love her and protect her.

752
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,470
If I marry her,

753
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,430
I'm related to the Lin family by blood.

754
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,280
It's my duty to protect the Lin family

755
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,670
and take care of Dabao.

756
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,910
If I marry her,

757
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,630
it's because she wants to marry me for love,

758
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,390
not for a trade.

759
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,320
Your Excellency, I'm willing to do

760
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,910
everything you've said just now,

761
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,230
only because I have her in my heart.

762
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,520
So you met and talked with my daughter

763
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,670
over and over again?

764
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,430
When did you meet?

765
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,710
How did you meet?

766
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,080
Your Excellency,

767
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,080
that's not

768
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
the point.

769
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,950
Then I'll see myself out.

770
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,760
Your Highness,

771
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,280
Yuan Hongdao from the Prime Minister's mansion

772
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,430
requests to see you.

773
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,000
He's come at the right moment. Here comes the news.

774
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,840
Yuan Hongdao pays respects to Your Highness.

775
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,520
Did the Prime Minister send you here?

776
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,520
The Prime Minister had me interrogate Si Lili

777
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,870
in the Investigator's Office.

778
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,230
What's the result?

779
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,360
Si Lili didn't tell Fan Xian

780
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,760
about the Second Young Master.

781
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,080
Your Highness,

782
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,360
the Prime Minister asked me to send a message.

783
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,040
From today on,

784
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,600
Fan Xian shall be regarded as
the son-in-law of the Lin family.

785
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,000
Let bygones be bygones.

786
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,710
In the future, he hopes that

787
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,150
Your Highness can pardon Fan Xian

788
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,000
for being rude for his sake.

789
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,360
Does the Prime Minister think I'm the one
who wants to kill Fan Xian?

790
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,910
I don't know what the Prime Minister thinks.

791
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,500
In the river of history,

792
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,700
time goes round and round.

793
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,060
Memories about the former and present lives

794
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,940
join each other in an endless way.

795
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,540
In the long drunken Milky Way,

796
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,260
one season follows another in a flash,

797
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,460
and the wild geese are flying south.

798
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,380
I just can't give up

799
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,380
to be with you for my whole life.

800
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,660
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

801
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,460
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

802
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,340
Year after year in the wandering,

803
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,900
I count the remaining years.

804
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,100
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

805
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,660
even though we have ended up the destiny,

806
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,340
I never feel regretful.

807
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,300
In such a chaotic world,

808
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,060
I still miss you as ever.

809
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,700
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

810
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,420
With a gentle heart,

811
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,980
I cherish our remaining years.

812
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,820
Even though we have to go through

813
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,780
all the hardships along the journey,

814
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:19,100
you always stay by my side,

815
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,860
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

816
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,780
Year after year in the wandering,

817
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,140
I count the remaining years.

818
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,500
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

819
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,300
even though we end up the destiny,

820
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,740
I never feel regretful.

821
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,660
In such a chaotic world,

822
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,620
I still miss you as ever.

823
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,300
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

824
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,060
With a gentle heart,

825
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,460
I cherish our remaining years.

826
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,260
Even though we have to go through

827
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,420
all the hardships along the journey,

828
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:59,700
you always stay by my side...
