1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 31

16
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,040
Do you want to see me?

17
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,000
What's up?

18
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,800
What is Lin Wan'er

19
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,000
to you?

20
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,190
A wife-to-be.

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
Do you want to marry her

22
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,270
for Neiku

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,870
or for herself?

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,270
Even if she's a maidservant

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,310
or a slave girl,

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,720
I'll marry nobody but her.

27
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,310
So you really fall in love with her.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,550
Are you holding the program

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,630
of "Agony Father"

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,630
in the middle of the night?

31
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,750
The Princess Royal

32
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,470
has been kneeling outside the Imperial Study

33
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,080
for quite a while.

34
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,080
How do you know about

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
what's happening in the palace?

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,190
That's not the point.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,110
The point is what you should do.

38
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,390
I'd make it up with a kick.

39
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,910
Since the result is already clear,

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,190
why don't you be generous

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,000
and intercede for her?

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,190
Intercede for her?

43
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,910
We should have mercy.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,600
Don't be too ruthless.

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,390
Don't drive her too hard.

46
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,440
Insidious as she is,

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,190
Li Yunrui has a lot of loyal followers as well.

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
If you shall have a foothold on the imperial court,

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
you must learn

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,190
the tactic of hardness and softness
to turn enemies into friends.

51
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,750
She tried to kill me!

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Fan Xian,

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,000
have you ever considered

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,960
how Lin Wan'er will feel?

55
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,080
Don't forget

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Li Yunrui is her biological mother after all.

57
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,360
You beat Li Yunrui in this round.

58
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,880
What next?

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
You want to drive her up to the wall.

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,960
How would Lin Wan'er think about it?!

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,910
If you plan

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,830
to get married in future,

63
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,800
will you get estranged because of this?

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,670
Fan Xian,

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,550
if you're sincere to her,

66
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,470
why can't you yield for her?

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,520
Allow me to think about it.

68
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,470
Tonight is the only chance

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,390
to intercede if you want.

70
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,070
Auntie,

71
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,640
it's wide spread that

72
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
you are on my side.

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,880
I am!

74
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,670
If really so,

75
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,230
why don't I have visibility

76
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,600
when you bribed Zhu Ge and contacted Zhuang Mohan?!

77
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,550
If you know all these,

78
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,510
it would be two people

79
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,390
kneeling here now.

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,110
Now I have to kneel anyhow!

81
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,510
Please allow me to meet His Majesty!

82
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,200
Your Highness,

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,160
it's not good for you

84
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,510
to kneel with me now.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,790
Your Highness,

86
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,350
His Majesty asks you to come in.

87
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,350
Auntie is physically weak.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,390
Please have mercy on her, Your Majesty!

89
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,480
No one else dares to

90
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,230
intercede for her other than you.

91
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,670
Do you know why?

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,790
They are afraid to get implicated.

93
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,790
Aren't you afraid?

94
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,440
I can't bear to see her get punished.

95
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,760
Softhearted princes in history

96
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,110
came to no good end.

97
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,790
Your Majesty,

98
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,320
please have mercy on Auntie.

99
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,070
Let's wait a bit more.

100
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,830
For what?

101
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,510
Let's see

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,070
if anyone else will intercede for her.

103
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,440
Possibly nobody dares to

104
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,480
as it has come to this point.

105
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,640
Not necessarily.

106
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,000
Your Majesty,

107
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,830
Fan Xian, Chief Musician of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices,

108
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,550
requests for a meeting.

109
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,110
Let him in.

110
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,950
It's such a surprise that

111
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,760
you are here.

112
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Are you here to intercede?

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,920
If it weren't for someone else's reminder,

114
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,600
I'd almost forget how Wan'er feels.

115
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,390
They are after all mother and daughter

116
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,440
no matter how much hostility

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,350
between them.

118
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,200
So...

119
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,600
To be honest,

120
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
it's a bit dis-organized in my mind.

121
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,920
So I found a place

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,830
and spent some time sitting there

123
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
to straighten it out.

124
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
Then I rushed here.

125
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,880
It's not too late anyway.

126
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,510
You are here to intercede for her?

127
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,200
I, Fan Xian,

128
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,320
sincerely beg Your Majesty not to have mercy

129
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,790
and punish Li Yunrui by the most severe means!

130
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,790
Rise!

131
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,230
You don't enjoy kneeling.

132
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,950
If you are really here to intercede,

133
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,880
I'd be very disappointed.

134
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,600
The Investigator's Office

135
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,880
and the power of the Neiku

136
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,550
can only be handed over to someone who can hold
their ground however much pressure they have.

137
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,070
I didn't think that much.

138
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,350
I'm curious about

139
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,320
how you changed your mind.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,070
As I said,

141
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,670
I found a place

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,320
and spent some time straightening it out.

143
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,950
Where is the place?

144
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,980
=Tomb of my deceased husband, Teng Zijing=

145
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,350
Now I'm leaving.

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,470
Thank you for helping me in the cooperation.

147
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,350
No need to thank me.

148
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,320
Someone wanted to get rid of you

149
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,520
by using the Investigator's Office.

150
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,150
Who?

151
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,960
We're still investigating.

152
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,350
When I arrive in the capital city,

153
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
I can figure it out for sure.

154
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,320
The one behind the assassination
attempt is extremely powerful

155
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,670
now that it even dared to do it in public.

156
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,960
If you stay,

157
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,790
this is just the beginning.

158
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,080
The road ahead

159
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,440
will be full of hazards.

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,550
In this case,

161
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,710
I'd never leave you alone in the capital city

162
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,710
where you may encounter

163
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,440
both open and covert attacks.

164
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,200
I stay

165
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,320
because I want to.

166
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,230
I won't regret

167
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,030
even if I have to undergo the most severe trials

168
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,520
and lose my life.

169
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,670
If Li Yunrui

170
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,880
only works against me,

171
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,150
I'd yield for Wan'er.

172
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,030
It's not easy to meet someone you truly love

173
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,350
in a life time.

174
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,550
But that's not the only point to consider.

175
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,030
She killed Teng Zijing.

176
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,150
There is no reason for me

177
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,350
to let her go!

178
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
If I'd interceded for her,

179
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,590
how selfish will I be!

180
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,640
All for a house guard?

181
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,080
No, it's for a human life.

182
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,520
You're not completely polished.

183
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,960
No one should be polished with
their judgement of right or wrong.

184
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm afraid

185
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,880
no one will come to intercede for her.

186
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,790
Let her go!

187
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,710
Thank you, Your Majesty!

188
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,000
Send her far away.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,440
Your Majesty, where shall she go?

190
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,200
She's been in the capital city for so many years.

191
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,960
Xinyang is her fief.

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
She can go back there.

193
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,840
Your Majesty!

194
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,030
His Majesty wants you to leave the capital city

195
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,200
for Xinyang.

196
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,440
Did Fan Xian come to intercede?

197
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
He came to throw a stone.

198
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,320
Fantastic!

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,640
I thought he came to intercede.

200
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,110
I was quite worried about that.

201
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,470
Too much luggage.

202
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,280
We should start packing up.

203
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,910
Auntie,

204
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,110
maybe I can try it again.

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
His Majesty's mind is like an abyss.

206
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,960
It can't be persuaded or guessed.

207
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,760
Whatever happened, she is the Princess Royal.

208
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,440
She can't be sent to the Ministry of Penalty.

209
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,790
Sending her to Xinyang

210
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,200
is already the most severe penalty.

211
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,080
She doesn't deserve to die.

212
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,760
Get out of the way!

213
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,590
Princess, please return!

214
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,470
Her Highness said she doesn't want to see you.

215
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,030
I'll just wait here.

216
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,280
No matter how long you wait, Her Highness won't see you.

217
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,670
She doesn't want to leave.

218
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,760
Shall you meet her?

219
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,030
Given her physical condition,

220
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,440
she will be seriously ill if she stands there for a night.

221
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,880
She will leave if she can't persist.

222
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,960
Her Highness might be weak physically,

223
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,590
but her temper

224
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,960
is just like that of Your Highness.

225
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,590
She won't leave

226
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,280
if she says so.

227
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,000
Come in!

228
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,150
There is freshly made ginseng tea.

229
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,960
Take some to warm up.

230
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,910
Are the maids in the palace all gone?

231
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,710
They are seeking other means of living,

232
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,200
thinking that by changing new hosts,

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,350
they can stay in the capital city.

234
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,470
It's not an easy thing.

235
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,550
It is far better than following me.

236
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,590
It is only too indifferent.

237
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,400
Kind-hearted people

238
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,830
have been devoured in the palace.

239
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,680
This is not right!

240
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,470
I shouldn't meet you now.

241
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,560
But since we have met,

242
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,230
I will leave a few words to you.

243
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,800
Now that I have lost,

244
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,310
you still come to see me.

245
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,000
That's a leap into the abyss.

246
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,040
In biological sense,

247
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,880
we are mother and daughter.

248
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,310
It justifies it.

249
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,230
After tonight,

250
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,000
you should pretend that we don't know each other.

251
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,800
Don't come to see me off tomorrow.

252
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,680
Have you betrayed Nanqing?

253
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,950
Does it really matter at this moment?

254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,950
If you're wronged,

255
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,070
I'll intercede with His Majesty.

256
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,800
Don't you understand the words

257
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,470
I just said?

258
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,590
So,

259
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,470
have you betrayed Nanqing?

260
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,160
I have!

261
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,160
What else do you want to ask?

262
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,680
Did you attempt to hurt Fan Xian?

263
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,560
I did!

264
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,160
You clearly know

265
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,880
he is my fiancé.

266
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,430
Why?

267
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,230
Are you here to question me

268
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,350
before I leave?

269
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,280
You came to see me

270
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,950
just a few times

271
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,110
ever since I was born.

272
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,680
I thought it must be very difficult for you

273
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,350
and things would become better after I grow up.

274
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,230
Later, I was taken out of the imperial harem

275
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,310
and suffered from severe illness.

276
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,040
You never ever came to see me

277
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,920
in the imperial residence.

278
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,920
When I was seriously ill,

279
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,520
I always wondered

280
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,230
whether you would come

281
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,160
before I died.

282
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,160
Do you even

283
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,920
have me as a daughter

284
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,000
in your heart?

285
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,350
You sabotaged Fan Xian without hesitation

286
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,000
for your fighting of power

287
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,000
because you never cared

288
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,880
and will never care

289
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,950
how I feel.

290
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Why would I care

291
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,880
how you feel?!

292
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,950
Happiness, suffering,

293
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,470
loneliness and sadness.

294
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,830
Who doesn't have these feelings

295
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,430
as long as living in this world?!

296
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,230
But you can only feel them

297
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,560
when you are alive.

298
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,830
Lin Wan'er,

299
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,560
I just want you to stay alive.

300
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,920
I don't care about anything else.

301
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,680
Do you think

302
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,230
what I did is just as simple as

303
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,560
colluding with Beiqi and betraying Nanqing?

304
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,470
Why wouldn't I see you?

305
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,520
Why would I hide from you

306
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,710
and the far, the better?

307
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,110
Because only by doing so,

308
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,590
can you stay out

309
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,680
when it breaks out

310
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,310
and stay alive

311
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,880
while I'm punished by hacking process.

312
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,920
What else have you done?

313
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,950
Stop asking!

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,430
You don't need to know.

315
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,400
Live your own life

316
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,590
in future

317
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,800
and take me as a vicious monster.

318
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,680
Stay away from me.

319
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,280
What about Fan Xian?

320
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,640
I told you I like him.

321
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,560
Killing him is also for my good?

322
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,310
If it's not because you like him,

323
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,680
I would not necessarily need to take his life.

324
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,230
Why is that?

325
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,560
As a woman,

326
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,280
you must not only rely on yourself

327
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,190
but also choose the right man.

328
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,000
Choosing the right man is critically important

329
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,040
to the rest of your life.

330
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,190
I've chosen him.

331
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,640
People like Fan Xian

332
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,830
won't end up good.

333
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,110
Why?

334
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,070
Why does His Majesty

335
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,800
get him in the capital city?

336
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,400
To take over Neiku

337
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,040
and the imperial financial power?

338
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,640
What else?

339
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,590
It's very clear that

340
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,070
Fan Xian is very close

341
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
to the Investigator's Office now.

342
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,000
Yes!

343
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,040
A lot of people will say he has
enjoyed success when he was young

344
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,680
and has a great future.

345
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,070
But have you noticed that

346
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,230
the Neiku and Investigator's Office

347
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,640
are the forefront for the fighting of power

348
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,950
between the Crown Prince and the Second Prince.

349
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,640
These are the position stared by all eyes.

350
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,110
Fan Xian will become

351
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,190
the most hated person

352
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,640
after he steps on there.

353
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,280
What lurk

354
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,070
in the imperial court

355
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,230
are dreadful monsters.

356
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,920
And Fan Xian

357
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,350
is a bait in the trap.

358
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,230
However glorious he is now,

359
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,470
he will be equally tragic in future.

360
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,110
Under the attacks of dreadful monsters,

361
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,040
what else ending will he have

362
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,950
other than being smashed into pieces?!

363
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
If it is merely a marriage contract,

364
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,920
I'd help you cancel it.

365
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,830
But you told me

366
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,920
you like him.

367
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,230
What else can I do?!

368
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,110
If I don't kill him,

369
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,470
I'm sending you onto an unreturnable path.

370
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,760
The good thing is

371
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,920
your sickness is getting better anyway.

372
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,310
After I leave,

373
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,070
find an excuse

374
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,280
and break up with Fan Xian.

375
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,350
I'll think of a way

376
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,190
to cancel the marriage contract for you.

377
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,880
I like him.

378
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,830
Then forget about him.

379
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,760
You like him,

380
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,400
but it doesn't mean you need to die with him.

381
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,430
Do you know

382
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,400
my favorite food?

383
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,470
What do I love to eat most?

384
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,710
Do you know what I like most

385
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,310
in my heart?

386
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,520
I only know staying alive

387
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,640
is the premise of like.

388
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,230
I like eating drumsticks.

389
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,560
You don't know it, but Fan Xian does.

390
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,760
I was stealing drumstick

391
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,680
when he first met me.

392
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,590
I liked the starry sky

393
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,710
at the beginning

394
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,520
because that's the most beautiful scenery

395
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,070
I had ever seen

396
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,590
as I grew up alone.

397
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,830
You don't know it, but Fan Xian does.

398
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,280
I've given him

399
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,110
the deepest loneliness

400
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,110
in my heart.

401
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,430
Once he knows,

402
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm no longer alone.

403
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,760
He is what I like most now

404
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,400
in my heart.

405
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,760
If he is stepping onto a path to death,

406
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,230
I'd follow him.

407
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,110
Life is a long journey.

408
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,000
There are more and better things and better people

409
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,470
waiting for you in the future.

410
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,830
If I find a person

411
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,160
to entrust my loneliness,

412
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,920
my life becomes meaningful

413
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,760
no matter it's long or short.

414
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,950
But you don't even have a life,

415
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
how come it becomes meaningful?

416
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,350
Didn't you just say

417
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
you'll stay away from me

418
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,560
to keep me uninvolved?

419
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,040
Why didn't you

420
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,280
stop doing those dangerous things

421
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,710
for me?

422
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,000
You've chosen your way,

423
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,680
so have I.

424
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,470
You also said

425
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,680
choosing the right man

426
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,070
is the way to survive.

427
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,350
So the man chosen by you

428
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,760
and relied by you

429
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,310
must not be my father, is it?

430
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
Who is he?

431
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,680
Who is it

432
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,710
that made you pay so much?

433
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,110
Just one last reminder!

434
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,430
Don't come to see me when I
leave the capital city tomorrow.

435
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,190
Her temper

436
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,160
really resembles mine.

437
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,420
=Capital City=

438
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,820
=Capital City=

439
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
Be safe on the way.

440
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,560
I'll visit you whenever I get free.

441
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,310
If you leave the capital city,

442
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,920
Chengze must launch an attack.

443
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,640
Farewell for now!

444
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,350
Go back!

445
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,400
Greetings, Your Highness!

446
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
She's already gone.

447
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,680
You don't have to drive her this hard, do you?!

448
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,160
Your Highness,

449
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm seeing her off

450
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,470
on behalf of Wan'er.

451
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,760
I don't know anything about what Auntie did.

452
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,950
Of course!

453
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,350
Let him through.

454
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,470
I'm humbly seeing Your Highness off

455
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,680
on behalf of Wan'er.

456
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,800
Thank goodness that

457
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,710
you didn't come to intercede for me.

458
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,710
It seems that Your Highness don't want me

459
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,800
to intercede for you.

460
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,760
No!

461
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,640
If you intercede for me,

462
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,040
I will have no excuse to revenge you.

463
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,110
It's all good now.

464
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,280
I can make some efforts

465
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,160
and prepare something

466
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,590
as a surprise for you.

467
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,830
Save it!

468
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm most happy already.

469
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,040
Really?

470
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,760
Yeah!

471
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,040
I once said that

472
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,160
I'll drive Your Highness out of the capital city.

473
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
Now it came true.

474
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,640
The happiness in my heart is beyond my description

475
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,400
and I'm in an ever-higher spirit.

476
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,110
To be very honest, Your Highness,

477
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,110
I had half a bowl more of rice

478
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,190
for today's breakfast.

479
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,000
That's good!

480
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,070
Keep a good appetite and take care of your body.

481
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,070
Wait for my return.

482
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,590
If Your Highness returns again,

483
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,590
you may not leave necessarily.

484
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,950
Living in the capital city forever is my wish.

485
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,880
Driving Your Highness out of the capital city

486
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,000
is also my wish.

487
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,070
Please set off, Your Highness!

488
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,680
By the way, Fan Xian,

489
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,280
I prepared a gift for you.

490
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,560
Off we go!

491
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,920
Teng Zijing is probably watching!

492
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,310
It must be so.

493
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,430
It's a pity to just drive her away

494
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,880
and let her live.

495
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,640
Your Excellency, please mind your words.

496
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,230
I didn't say it's her!

497
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,190
Just now I heard

498
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,470
Her Highness said

499
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,710
she prepared a gift for you.

500
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,520
You must be careful!

501
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,880
Let's go!

502
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,950
Your Excellency!

503
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,310
Young Master Guo!

504
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,400
Have you had breakfast?

505
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,230
I won't let you go!

506
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,560
Let's go!

507
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Your Excellency, are we gonna notify the imperial court?

508
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,230
Forget about it!

509
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,310
Is Guo Baokun

510
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,920
the trap she set up

511
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,000
for us?

512
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,430
Li Yunrui's trap

513
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,760
won't be this easy.

514
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,560
Wait!

515
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,350
Why are you here?

516
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,710
She is my mother after all.

517
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,310
I'm sorry!

518
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,830
She wanted to hurt you and
you just tried to protect yourself.

519
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,950
I understand.

520
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,950
You are still willing to see her off

521
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,950
at this time point.

522
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,560
I'm the one who should be thankful.

523
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,680
She said the path you've chosen

524
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,760
will turn yourself into the target of public criticism

525
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,830
which is therefore a dead end.

526
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,800
What I want to tell you is

527
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,280
whichever road you take is fine

528
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,350
as long as you like it.

529
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,430
I'll keep you company.

530
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,560
=Imperial Study=

531
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,910
If it is still about

532
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,360
Fan Xian's leakage of information

533
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,840
that led the seizure of Yan Bingyun,

534
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,840
you don't need to meet His Majesty.

535
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,390
Just give me

536
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,080
your memorials.

537
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,470
Uncle! Master Yuan!

538
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,670
Take a seat!

539
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,630
Master Yuan,

540
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,840
this round of play doesn't hold any promise.

541
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,040
Not good! Not good! Not good!

542
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,800
This move is not good!

543
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,320
You can retract a move?!

544
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,840
His Excellency has retracted dozens of moves

545
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,470
in today's game.

546
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,520
How do you play like that?

547
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,600
Playing the game of Go is like fighting in the battlefield.

548
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,150
Its tricks are exquisite and extraordinary
which are beyond prediction.

549
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,870
That's also the principle of conducting ourselves.

550
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,080
You are still young

551
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,840
and should learn about it from life.

552
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,320
May I ask

553
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,150
whether Master Yuan can retract his moves or not?

554
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,470
Of course not!

555
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,280
Your Excellency is indeed very smart.

556
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,390
Your self-conduct is admiring.

557
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,840
I also want to remind you the fact that

558
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,230
there is not so much fairness in the world.

559
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,230
Sometimes,

560
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,600
it takes a lot of means

561
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,230
to start well and end well.

562
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,150
So Your Excellency's game today

563
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,080
is meant to remind Mr. Fan.

564
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,800
But I don't understand

565
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
why you retracted your moves

566
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,910
in the past.

567
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,710
I invite you here

568
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,430
to discuss something.

569
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,600
Li Yunrui lost and left the capital city.

570
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,710
So logically,

571
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,760
it's time to prepare for the wedding

572
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,910
between you and Wan'er.

573
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,710
There is change to the marriage contract?

574
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,320
It's not related to the marriage contract.

575
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,950
A lot of officers from the Six Ministries

576
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,040
submitted memorials to the throne

577
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,630
the other day in the Imperial Study

578
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,600
about your leakage of information

579
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,150
that led to the seizure of Yan Bingyun.

580
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:58,040
They all required it to be thoroughly investigated.

581
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,320
But it was leaked

582
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,430
by the Princess Royal.

583
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,710
Li Yunrui only admits colluding with Zhu Ge

584
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,670
to gang up for personal interest.

585
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,320
She never admits

586
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,230
giving away Yan Bingyun.

587
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,230
That's her trap.

588
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,910
What did His Majesty say?

589
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,120
He didn't say anything

590
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,470
other than watching the mounting public indignation.

591
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,600
Uncle,

592
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,470
I didn't do anything.

593
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,520
I am wronged.

594
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,600
The truth is not important.

595
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,760
Then what is important?

596
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,040
Your attitude.

597
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,840
I don't understand.

598
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,320
I know a little bit

599
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,840
about His Majesty.

600
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,560
If I don't make it wrong,

601
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,280
he will reach out to you very soon.

602
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,280
Reach out to me? For what?

603
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,230
Whatever he asks you to do,

604
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,710
don't promise him.

605
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
He is the emperor.

606
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,430
How can I deny his requirement?!

607
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,520
He didn't make the decision on court.

608
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,710
Naturally it will be determined in private.

609
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,800
Fan Xian,

610
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,000
your wedding with Wan'er

611
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,280
is under preparation.

612
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,430
Once you're married,

613
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,080
I'll transfer you to the Ministry of Personnel.

614
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,430
So don't create any trouble

615
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,190
at this important point.

616
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,000
If it's not a distinct order,

617
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,560
don't promise.

618
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,040
If there should be any trouble,

619
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,760
put it on me.

620
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,000
Is that even possible?

621
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:44,150
The emperor and the officer are not
like the master and the servant.

622
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,150
They are more like two chess players.

623
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,040
You can lose any chess piece,

624
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:00,710
but you also need to fight for the necessary.

625
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,150
You didn't do anything wrong in this.

626
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,150
Besides,

627
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,670
in view of your title as the Poetic Genius Fan,

628
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,120
even His Majesty

629
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,670
doesn't have any way

630
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,430
to force you on the court.

631
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,280
But how do you tell

632
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,080
His Majesty will find me in private

633
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,390
to allow me to justify myself.

634
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,760
His Majesty is most interested

635
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,360
in the fight between people

636
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,870
and can handle like nothing.

637
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,430
In his view, you still need more testing.

638
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,800
And now is better than never.

639
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,670
Your Excellency,

640
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,560
Mr. Fan is summoned to meet His Majesty in palace.

641
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,560
There it goes!

642
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,800
Off you go!

643
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,470
Remember what I said.

644
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,280
No matter what you're requested,

645
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,760
don't promise

646
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,040
unless you're clearly requested to with an imperial edict.

647
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,430
I'll have a try.

648
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,000
Lucky!

649
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,800
Master Yuan,

650
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
I won again this time.

651
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,870
There is still room left.

652
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,870
My bad! My bad! My bad!

653
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,910
It's OK now.

654
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,150
You won!

655
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,560
Your Highness! Your Highness!

656
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,560
This is...

657
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,360
Your Excellency! Please take a seat.

658
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,430
This side please.

659
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,430
What's going on?

660
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,670
I don't know either.

661
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,230
His Majesty summoned us

662
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,670
and didn't tell us why.

663
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,150
It's hard to tell if it's good or bad.

664
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,320
His Majesty's will is deep and unpredictable.

665
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,430
Don't even try to guess His Majesty's will.

666
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,230
Your Highness is reasonable and loyal

667
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,560
which is very admiring.

668
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,470
What do you think?

669
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,120
It's a contest between Your Highnesses.

670
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,430
I'd rather stay impartial.

671
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,840
Only you

672
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,000
dare to say anything you want.

673
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,470
Your Majesty, everyone is here.

674
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,000
We can start the meal.

675
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,950
This is a family meal.

676
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,470
Help yourselves!

677
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,230
Your Majesty,

678
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,230
since it's a family meal,

679
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,760
my presence is improper.

680
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,560
You're thick-skinned. It's alright!

681
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,870
Go ahead with it!

682
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,500
In the river of history,

683
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,700
time goes round and round.

684
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,060
Memories about the former and present lives

685
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,940
join each other in an endless way.

686
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,540
In the long drunken Milky Way,

687
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,260
one season follows another in a flash,

688
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,460
and the wild geese are flying south.

689
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,380
I just can't give up

690
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,380
to be with you for my whole life.

691
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,660
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

692
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,460
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

693
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,340
Year after year in the wandering,

694
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,900
I count the remaining years.

695
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,100
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

696
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,660
even though we have ended up the destiny,

697
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,340
I never feel regretful.

698
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,300
In such a chaotic world,

699
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,060
I still miss you as ever.

700
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,700
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

701
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,420
With a gentle heart,

702
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,980
I cherish our remaining years.

703
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,820
Even though we have to go through

704
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,780
all the hardships along the journey,

705
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:34,100
you always stay by my side,

706
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,860
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

707
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,780
Year after year in the wandering,

708
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,140
I count the remaining years.

709
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,500
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

710
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,300
even though we end up the destiny,

711
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,740
I never feel regretful.

712
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,660
In such a chaotic world,

713
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,620
I still miss you as ever.

714
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,300
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

715
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,060
With a gentle heart,

716
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,460
I cherish our remaining years.

717
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,260
Even though we have to go through

718
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,420
all the hardships along the journey,

719
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:14,700
you always stay by my side...
