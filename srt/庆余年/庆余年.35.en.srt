17
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,900
The Northern Qi people busted him out.

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,140
Northern Qi knows that they are wrong. They won't stop us from getting Yan Bingyun back.

19
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,210
Northern Qi?

20
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,080
The adopted son of Xiao En, Shang Shanhu. You know him, right?

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,450
My Lord has communication with Shang Shanhu?

22
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm just borrowing his name.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,820
The Great General ordered me to come and save you.

24
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,480
You’re under Hu'er?

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,130
Yes.

26
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,780
If there is no damage to Qing, I will listen to any order.

27
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,960
Good. In a while, I will fight Xiao En with all my might.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,750
We’re nearing the border. There’s not much time. Get ready to attack.

29
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,320
We’ll enter the forest and cut to the north.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,550
Go! Great General is waiting for you upfront!

31
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,710
Xiao En broke out with the help of Shang Shanhu‘s people. Everyone chase from different directions!

32
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,790
- Yes, My Lord! 
 - Hurry!

33
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,590
Okay.

34
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,660
There weren’t any holes, right?

35
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,390
My Lord came at the right time. Xiao En didn’t have time to ask more.

36
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,070
That shout of “Great General” made everyone think this was done by Shang Shanhu.

37
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,160
We should also go after him now.

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,620
Will we reach him?

39
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,570
Don’t worry. Someone’s following him.

40
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,230
Who’s there?

41
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,290
Mister Xiao, you are indeed alert.

42
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,940
Good and light body skills.

43
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,140
You’re too kind. I’ve been scared recently, so my moves are restrained.

44
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,020
You organized the chains, right?

45
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,350
You’re too kind.

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,610
Leaving a trail.

47
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,510
You run yours and I’ll keep busy with mine. We won’t interfere with each other.

48
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,420
My Lord, are you okay?

49
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,110
My Lord...

50
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,120
Senior, you’re old.

51
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,200
Perhaps they ran that way.

52
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,780
- My Lord, we didn’t find them. 
 - Young Master, who do we kill?

53
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,700
He’s not here.

54
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,440
- Then let’s go back. 
 - Go back, my ass.

55
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,950
Search!  He’s definitely nearby.

56
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,130
If it were back then, you’d be long dead.

57
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,460
Time doesn’t wait for people.

58
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,100
So no one’s coming to save me.

59
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,290
Those who pretended to be under Shang Shanhu were all my people.

60
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,830
You tricked me out of the diplomatic entourage to kill me.

61
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,680
- I’ll ask you a question. 
 - Go on.

62
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,860
Do you know Danzhou?

63
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,140
I grew up in Danzhou.

64
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,300
No wonder...

65
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,420
What’s the meaning of this question?

66
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,020
It's nothing.  You can kill me now.

67
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,330
Take her down.

68
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,390
Your knife...

69
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,680
Come one step closer and I’ll take his life.

70
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,640
Take it then.

71
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,350
You’re not here to save him?

72
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,400
No, you kill yours, I’ll just watch.

73
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,800
What’s your relationship with Ku He?

74
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,490
Oh, you’ve guessed it.

75
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,460
Ku He’s disciple, Saintess Haitang (Begonia).

76
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,710
Haitang Duoduo (Blossoming Begonias).

77
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,990
You can call me Haitang or Duoduo.

78
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,780
Fan Xian.

79
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,330
I know you.  Southern Qing’s God of Poetry.

80
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,930
Young, with deadly tactics.

81
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,890
You’re not a good person.

82
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,370
You’re also here to kill him?

83
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,200
I’ll let you kill him. I’ll just observe.

84
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,750
Fine, give me the knife.

85
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
Watch him.

86
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,830
Let’s fight.

87
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,660
Are you crazy? I already said I’m not here to save him.

88
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,800
We can talk after we fight.

89
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,510
Do you really have a problem?

90
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,550
Shameless!

91
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,410
If you don’t believe me, you can go cut him first.

92
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,320
You’re right.

93
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh right!

94
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,460
This is for you.

95
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,140
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

96
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,180
So powerful! You’re indeed above Ninth Level.

97
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,660
I admire you.

98
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,250
You can also be considered a master among the young.

99
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,730
You actually have such deadly methods.

100
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,910
Just then I didn’t do it on purpose.

101
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,410
Also, fighting is fighting.

102
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,010
Why do you talk so much about methods?

103
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,410
Why did you make the first move?

104
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,520
Someone told me if I want to keep improving myself,

105
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,230
I need to find masters to fight.

106
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,110
It would be a pity not to fight a master like you.

107
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,880
- Just for this? 
 - What else?

108
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,880
Since we’re not fighting anymore, kill him.

109
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,660
Duoduo, you... Wh-Why do you want to kill him?

110
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,700
Teacher wants to kill him.

111
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,480
Then, why does Ku He want to kill him?

112
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,220
I don’t want to tell you.

113
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,740
Are you going to make a move or not? If not, I’ll do it.

114
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,920
He doesn’t want to kill me.

115
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,910
If he did, he would’ve done it before.

116
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,440
Senior is correct.

117
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,820
I’ve used up all my energy to control you.

118
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,530
How could I just let you die like this?

119
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,100
If you’re really not going to kill him, I’ll do it.

120
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,900
Yan Xiaoyi, Commander Yan.

121
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,520
Fan Xian, you will repay Jingdu’s humiliation today.

122
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,590
That arrow was aimed at me. Why’d you block it?

123
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,320
Subconscious reflexes. I only realized it was to kill you afterward.

124
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,870
Ninth Level Archery God of our Qing. The one and only.

125
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,840
- What’s that got to do with me? 
 - A lot.

126
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,160
I’ll introduce you guys. Northern Qi’s Virgin Haitang Duoduo.

127
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,930
Commander Yan, kill the saintess!

128
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,430
It's a great chance to make your name in the army!

129
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,170
Whatever you say, you’re dying today.

130
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,480
- Young Lady, be careful. I fear Commander Yan wants to kill you. 
 - Shameless.

131
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,410
You’re right. This person is too shameless.

132
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,300
In a while, the two of us should go out together to cover each other.

133
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,470
Warhorses?

134
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,790
Yan Xiaoyi brought riders with him.

135
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,740
Lady Duoduo, in a while we can work together...

136
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,890
Where is she?

137
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,650
She was here just then.

138
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,930
My Lord, the horses are getting closer.

139
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,590
They are dressed like Northern Qi riders.

140
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,920
It's so coincidental that they used Shang Shanhu's name and he came in person.

141
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,970
The soldiers from Northern Qi.

142
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,430
Why did the soldiers of Northern Qi come here?

143
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,820
The border is not far away from here. They sneaked in.

144
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,390
Adoptive Father, long time no see.
<i>[Shang Shanhu: Northern Qi's Top General] </i>

145
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,760
General, one step further

146
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,520
and you can wait to host the funeral for your adoptive father!

147
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,750
Is he here to kill you, too?

148
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,920
My Lord, be careful!

149
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,260
The wounds on my adoptive father are due to you.

150
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,230
Another Ninth Level.

151
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,210
I heard that you are the God of Poetry.

152
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,200
How about I give you a poem and we can part our ways friendly.

153
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
Leave it as your last words.

154
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,370
When I heard your name, I really wanted to know.

155
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,080
Is your last name Shang or Shangshan?

156
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,100
A dead body will nurture everything.

157
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,990
Death is just the beginning.

158
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,940
That’s Fan Xian, the one I want to kill.

159
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,220
The other is Shang Shanhu, Northern Qi’s Great General.

160
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,790
"Great General."

161
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,090
If I kill him, can I be rewarded?

162
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,520
It's like taking a city.

163
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,370
If I want you to do it, will you be scared?

164
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,050
Wait, wait!  Come back! Your bravery is amazing.

165
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,050
Young Master, let’s do it.

166
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,320
Wait until Fan Xian dies.

167
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,160
If I’d known earlier, I wouldn’t have fought those two battles.

168
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,210
Wait!

169
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,060
<i> Do you know Danzhou? </i>

170
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,490
<i> I grew up in Danzhou.</i>

171
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,310
Adoptive Father, do you want to do it yourself?

172
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,420
Don’t kill him yet.

173
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,450
Why not kill him?

174
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,970
Maybe they need hostages?

175
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,050
So lucky.

176
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,190
Are we returning to Qi?

177
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,680
Yes.

178
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,490
We're in Southern Qing after all. We should go back as soon as possible.

179
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
Bring him with us.

180
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,440
- Should we do it?
- That's enough.

181
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,220
You are not scared of anything. A bunch of villagers.

182
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,540
What do you want? Do you want to take on the Northern Qi cavalry?

183
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,760
Follow them secretly and find a chance to do it.

184
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,220
How long had you been in Danzhou?

185
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,670
Since childhood.

186
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,560
- When did you go back to Jingdu?
- Not long ago.

187
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,400
And you became an administrator of the Inspection and Control Bureau this fast?

188
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,840
I got lucky.

189
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,400
You answer fast.

190
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,850
I'm caught already. I know my place.

191
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,350
Adoptive Father, do you need to bring those people as well?

192
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,690
No, I just need him.

193
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,170
Kill them all?

194
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,140
You dare!

195
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,360
Kill them all!

196
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,970
No, but...

197
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,390
Shang Shanhu, you need not be nervous.

198
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,860
Your saving Xiao En has nothing to do with me.

199
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,560
I just want his life.

200
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,660
I can acquiesce another step.

201
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,340
It’s fine if you kill him, too.

202
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,220
Once Fan Xian is dead, I’ll leave.

203
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,140
I’ve said already, I need to take him back.

204
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,360
You heard that.

205
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,600
Then you’ll all die here.

206
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,020
Kill them all!

207
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,420
<i>Without the arrow, Shang Shanhu wouldn't dare move by himself.</i>

208
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,640
It's not the best chance.

209
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,270
Adoptive Father, let's go north.

210
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,730
<i>Kill the Qi dogs!</i>

211
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,050
<i>Kill the Qi dogs!</i>

212
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,010
Oh my god!

213
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,780
It's true.

214
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,360
<i>We are all veterans from the battlefield.</i>

215
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
<i>Killing and robbery–</i>

216
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,990
<i>We are better than normal people. We won't interfere.</i>

217
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,860
Kill Shang Shanhu!

218
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,630
You dare get distracted facing my arrows?

219
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,750
Fan Xian!

220
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,400
Young Master Guo!

221
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,830
- Thank you, Young Master Guo. 
 - Bullshit!

222
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,060
This is my knife, right? Thank you, Young Master Guo for bringing it to me.

223
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,850
You despicable thief!

224
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,730
Fan Xian, I want to kill you!

225
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,220
I know. I know. Everyone’s here to kill me. Wait a sec.

226
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,600
Commander Yan!

227
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,090
Commander Yan! I'm the palace writer, Guo Baokun!

228
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,640
I’m here to kill Fan Xian, too!

229
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,580
They are all veterans from Qing! They are not robbers!

230
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,150
It's Young Master Guo.

231
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,970
Commander Yan, what are you doing?

232
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,470
It’s not reasonable

233
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,340
Yan Xiaoyi left the barracks without authorization.

234
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,390
He wouldn't leave one person living to let other people know.

235
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,390
Watch them.

236
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,620
If you don’t make a move now,

237
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,670
we’re all going to die at the hands of Yan Xiaoyi!

238
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,310
The war god of Northern Qi is falling down today.

239
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,120
Yan Xiaoyi is the only Ninth Level archer in the world.

240
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,290
If you don’t kill him now, Northern Qi will definitely have many casualties on the battlefield in the future.

241
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,840
Who can do it?

242
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,260
It's the righteousness of your country! You can't back off!

243
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,100
My clothes are dirty.

244
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,440
Haitang Duoduo?

245
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,490
Good Kung Fu...

246
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,690
How did you know I was here?

247
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,620
I didn’t. I just shouted as a trial. I guessed.

248
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,790
My Lord, I saw the diplomatic entourage’s guards coming.

249
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,820
Let’s go!

250
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,310
I definitely won’t give him to you.

251
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,780
Is Lady Duoduo still not going?

252
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,900
I’ll go once I kill Xiao En.

253
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,340
Enough people have died today.

254
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,520
All of them together won’t stop me.

255
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,110
They won’t make a move. It’s just us two.

256
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,430
You’re not my opponent.

257
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,800
Bravery is most important in a fight of warriors.

258
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,480
Even if I can't win, we need to fight with dignity.

259
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,380
Good.

260
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,100
I never thought that you were a brave man.

261
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,040
I thought less of you.

262
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,250
The results are clear. Thank you.

263
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,730
Didn’t you just say that we’d fight with dignity?

264
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,520
I am a disciple of Fei Jie. Drugs and poisons are dignified methods in our sect.

265
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,220
Didn’t Fei Jie tell you that poisons are useless in those of Ninth Level or higher?

266
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,840
Do you feel your breathing increasing and heart rate quickening?

267
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,110
Poisoning is useless, but this isn’t a poison.

268
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,510
Then, what is it?

269
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,950
Aphrodisiac.

270
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,320
You!

271
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,790
Please stop fighting.

272
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,570
I never take advantage of people. It’ll be better if you leave now.

273
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Faster breathing,

274
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,060
hard to calm down. It really is an aphrodisiac!

275
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,650
- Hide Xiao En first.
- There is no time.

276
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,360
Mr. Xiao, just say that I caught you in a minute.

277
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,750
I'm the only person who is willing to save your life now.

278
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,360
- What about him?
- Bring him, too.

279
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,870
Northern Qi sent people to save Xiao En.

280
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:50,370
Master Fan led the soldiers to catch Xiao En back.

281
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,850
So please feel relieved.

282
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,030
There is nothing to worry about. Let's take a rest.

283
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,370
- We'll leave as soon as possible.
<i>- Okay.</i>

284
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,760
Master Fan has a hard time chasing them all this way.

285
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,460
Senior, get in the cart.

286
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,780
Kill the people in the diplomatic entourage. And whatever questions you have,

287
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,600
I can answer them.

288
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,560
I do want to catch you, but I don't want to commit treason.

289
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,100
Senior Xiao,

290
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,930
a good chance escapes fast. Just get in the cart without tricks.

291
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,430
There will be chances.

292
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,720
What I'm always curious about is that

293
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,110
I haven't killed you for the secrets you are hiding,

294
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,240
so why haven't you killed me?

295
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:43,640
What's so special about Danzhou to let people like you to stop killing.

296
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,940
From the beginning to the end, the Black Knights never showed up.

297
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,680
If Chen Pingping was truly protecting you,

298
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,060
how could he forget that?

299
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,260
Be careful.

300
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,990
We were almost in Northen Qi, but Shang Shanhu still led the soldiers to rob the entourage.

301
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,850
Apparently, the situation in Northern Qi is not good for Senior Xiao.

302
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,200
You need to be careful yourself.

303
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,550
Find more allies.

304
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,110
Don't just rely on Chen Pingping.

305
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,590
Don't worry, Master. Everything is covered.

306
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,090
Have you seen any Black Knights nearby?

307
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,460
No.

308
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,820
- Where is Guo Baokun?
- Over there.

309
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,130
As soon as we got to the barracks, he was sitting there without moving.

310
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,810
The Black Knights are not here,

311
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,240
maybe because Head neglected it all of sudden.

312
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,370
All your underlings have been buried.

313
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,350
They were good at fighting and they were brave. They were from the army.

314
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,950
I asked them to come here to kill you!

315
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,440
Why would you kill me?

316
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,610
- To avenge my father.
- Is your father dead?

317
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,540
- Your father is dead!
- Why would you avenge him if he is not dead?

318
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,300
- It's you that framed him into prison?
- Why did you fight Shang Shanhu?

319
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,640
- I wanted to kill both of you!
- Why would you kill Shang Shanhu?

320
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,940
If I kill him, I can exchange for the release of my father.

321
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,630
Since Shang Shanhu is not dead, what would happen to your father?

322
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,950
I–

323
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,200
Two choices for you.

324
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,960
One, kill me now.

325
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,870
- That's my choice.
- Or I'll save your father.

326
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,120
We don't really have deep resentment between us.

327
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,580
Bullshit! You hit me. Of course, you don't have deep resentment towards me.

328
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,990
Today, I was caught by Shang Shanhu. No matter what, I escaped because of what you did.

329
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:19,440
I owe you one. How about this?

330
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,260
We make a deal.

331
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,180
After we pick up Yan Bingyun and get back to Jingdu,

332
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,770
I will speak to the emperor in person and beg for your father.

333
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,790
- What's the use of you begging?
- I would be useless if Princess Royal were still there.

334
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,890
Now that Li Yunrui has been kicked out of Jingdu,

335
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,490
the charge of your father's plotting is not important anymore.

336
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,610
What kind of tricks are you playing this time?

337
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,800
I have conditions.

338
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,000
After we get back to Jingdu, in person,

339
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,390
you need to charge Yan Xiaoyi for colluding with Northern Qi to assassinate the diplomatic entourage.

340
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,320
Stop thinking. Even if you don't charge me, Yan Xiaoyi will find ways to kill you, too.

341
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,170
What else do you want?

342
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,680
After your father is released from prison, the friends, families, and allies of your Guo family

343
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,710
will be my allies in the court.

344
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,320
After my father got into prison, nobody cared about us.

345
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,120
What ally?

346
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,010
Of course, nobody cares about you when you are down and out.

347
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,400
But as soon as your father is released from prison,

348
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,240
friends from old times will rush back.

349
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,920
This is how society is like.

350
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,920
You have Chen Pingping from the Inspection and Control Bureau to take care of you.

351
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,660
Why do you have to ask our family to help you?

352
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,160
Just tell me if you agree or not.

353
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:35,390
Other than me, do you have another chance?

354
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,600
We are leaving soon. Why don't you get back in the cart?

355
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,110
Aphrodisiac?

356
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,900
How come even you know about this?

357
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,820
You brought an aphrodisiac along with you. You are not a noble person after all.

358
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,200
Master Fan, I'm the only lady in the diplomatic entourage.

359
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,760
Who is the aphrodisiac for if you carry it with you?

360
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,000
The... This is not what you think.

361
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,090
Master!

362
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,610
Yan Xiaoyi.

363
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,980
Save her!

364
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,860
You are awake. It's lucky that your lungs and heart are not hurt.

365
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,720
It was Yan Xiaoyi. I was careless.

366
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,680
I thought that everything was settled. I didn't expect him to come back.

367
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,050
It's hard to avoid the assassination by a Ninth Level archer.

368
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,550
He was wounded as well. This shot was not strong and he won't come back anytime soon. Don't worry.

369
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,800
Master Fan.

370
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,830
Tell me what you need.

371
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:36,100
Who took my clothes off?

372
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,270
The... I'm the only one who has medical skills in the entourage.

373
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,460
You had to have somebody to take care of your wound.

374
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,580
Did you take off everything?

375
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,570
I needed to wrap the wound.

376
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,460
It was an emergency.

377
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,980
The aphrodisiac...

378
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,370
It's not an aphrodisiac.

379
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,920
It's Master's call then.

380
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,600
It's really not!

381
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,100
- Then what is it?
<i>- Master.</i>

382
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,840
What?

383
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,120
<i>Come down and take a look.</i>

384
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,300
Master, should we kill her?

385
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,990
We can't beat her.

386
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,720
We can probably use a strong crossbow.

387
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,350
Don't follow me.

388
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,160
Master.

389
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,860
Drying the river with your indigenous force. Did you get in the river?

390
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,870
Follow me. Just you.

391
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,500
This way, please.

392
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,470
This lady is really skilled at martial arts.

393
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,260
There is no need. Our master has asked us to wait here.

394
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,130
Brother Wang, I feel worried!

395
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,530
There is no need. I feel that this Northern Qi saintess

396
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,570
likes my master's handsomeness and dashing self.

397
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,560
She wants to express her heart in private.

398
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,710
Our master poisoned her and she starts to like him?

399
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,700
The key is the medicine. My master learned from Senior Fei.

400
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,000
The aphrodisiac is not ordinary.

401
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,500
Of course, this saintess

402
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,230
really likes him with a true heart.

403
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,190
Is there a medicine like this?

404
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,820
The master has many magical skills.

405
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,970
Just follow me.

406
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,260
I will answer your questions.

407
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,630
Okay!

408
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,750
- The antidote.
- Listen to me.

409
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,200
- One more word and I will kill you.
- It was not an aphrodisiac.

410
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm not lying. Think of this. I was there to chase Xiao En.

411
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,430
Why would I bring an aphrodisiac if I was chasing Xiao En?

412
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,130
Then, what is it? Why–

413
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,840
Why was your heart beating fast and your blood rushing? Actually, I made it myself.

414
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,070
It will increase your metabolism and make you more energetic.

415
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,340
What is metabolism?

416
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,600
Let me tell you this way. If you use this medicine after you are hurt,

417
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,530
it can stimulate your potential so that you can maintain your fighting power.

418
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,290
It's not only not poisonous, but also good for your body.

419
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,810
The increased heartbeat is the effect of the medicine. Although your body is slightly feverish,

420
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,370
but your reaction speed is much faster. Don't you feel that?

421
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,600
You were lying to me.

422
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,260
If I didn't say it, you would kill me at that time.

423
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,610
Were you afraid that I might see through you?

424
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,380
I don't think you have any experience.

425
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,500
Why do you keep lying to me?

426
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,450
I'm a noble person. I can't lie to you.

427
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,110
Stop this bullshit.

428
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,690
If I don't tell you the truth now, you can just kill me then.

429
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,750
I can kill you now.

430
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,900
No, you can't.

431
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,750
Then go to hell.

432
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,080
You won't kill me.

433
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,570
You feel so confident.

434
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,590
Just then, everybody saw you calling me down the road.

435
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,940
If I die, there might be a war between Qing and Northern Qi.

436
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,220
You are the saintess of Northern Qi. You don't want people to suffer.

437
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,230
I can kill you and everybody in your entourage.

438
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,810
You don't like killing.

439
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,590
How do you know?

440
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,690
If you liked killing,

441
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,170
you wouldn't have let me kill Xiao En.

442
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,000
You would have done it yourself.

443
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,860
Also, now you wanted to talk to me about getting the antidote.

444
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,030
Do you want to eat it?

445
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,660
How come there is somebody like you?

446
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,860
Aren't you afraid that it's poisoned?

447
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,930
- It's so sweet.
- Of course.

448
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,880
It's a present from our Qing to your Northen Qi royal family.

449
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,990
It was stolen from the entourage.

450
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,570
Brother Wang, why are they still not back?

451
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,760
It's right that they are not back at this time.

452
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,500
Brother Wang, what does this mean?

453
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,030
Think about it. The Northen Qi saintess is skilled at martial arts.

454
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,810
If she really kills our master,

455
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:14,900
it wouldn't take so long. They must be talking pleasantly and they are friends not enemies now.

456
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,780
That's so fast.

457
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,010
It's so magical.

458
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,950
WIth the friendliness of my master,

459
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,140
maybe they are eating fruit together.

460
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,990
You are the saintess?

461
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,970
