00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:19,620
(Episode 45)

5
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,429
Ms. Seo, this is Choi Soo Hee.

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,370
Are you at Ms. Jung's father's funeral by any chance?

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,899
Yes, Ms. Choi.

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,409
Is...

9
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,179
Director Choi there too?

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,579
No, he's not.

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,350
Are you sure?

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,149
Yes, why would he be here?

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,859
All right, take it easy.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,900
Si Woo, where are you?

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,609
Where are you now?

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,750
Thank you, Ms. Seo.

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,349
By the way, what's going on?

18
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:25,989
I'm attending a colleague's father's funeral. Is it that surprising?

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,500
- Mr. Kang. - Yes.

20
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,069
Thank you for coming.

21
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,069
I'm sure Ms. Jung's father must've forgiven you for everything.

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,939
Thank you.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,109
Enjoy your food.

24
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,530
Oh, boy.

25
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,169
Don't think about anything and get as much rest as possible.

26
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,009
Okay.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,719
I wanted to see our baby, Savior,

28
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,889
walking in these shoes.

29
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,659
Don't cry.

30
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,789
Seeing you cry breaks my heart.

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,930
Who's calling?

32
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,500
It's Lawyer Heo Chung San from Hyunkang.

33
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes, Mr. Heo.

34
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,210
Yes, it's fine.

35
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,979
I see. I'll be right there. Okay.

36
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,349
I'm so sorry to hear about the miscarriage.

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,919
I'm not sure how I can console you.

38
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,460
You must know that Nam Jin's mother...

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,000
turned herself into the police earlier today.

40
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,069
Yes, I got a call from the police station.

41
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,080
She feels terrible about what happened.

42
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,479
She did it on the spur of the moment when she saw...

43
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,710
blood on Nam Jin's face.

44
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,150
Also, she had no idea...

45
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,490
that your wife was pregnant.

46
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,460
I understand what you're trying to say.

47
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,099
But regardless of the circumstances,

48
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,099
I can't forgive her.

49
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,370
Right.

50
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,840
I completely understand.

51
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:58,379
Ms. Yang said that this breaks her heart...

52
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,009
because she's miscarried as well in the past.

53
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,750
That was my wife's first pregnancy...

54
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,520
at the age of 40.

55
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,520
When I was going to divorce her because of her brother,

56
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,889
the baby was conceived like a miracle and kept us together.

57
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,759
But how could that happen?

58
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,199
I fully understand how you must feel,

59
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,009
but I think it's a bit harsh for you to tell us...

60
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,740
to find another manufacturer.

61
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,379
That's true,

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,620
but how could I continue working with Nam Jin...

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,990
as if nothing happened?

64
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,329
I'll make sure you'll never have to see him.

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,899
How about I have another employee be in charge of contacting...

66
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,370
and working with your factory?

67
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,009
If you continue to manufacture for his team until the third round,

68
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,949
I'll give you Hyunkang shares in a year.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,019
Hyunkang shares?

70
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,120
Yes.

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,160
You got your shares taken away unfairly,

72
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,430
so we should compensate you.

73
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,269
I can't just sit here.

74
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,879
I should go and confirm.

75
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,920
I understand how you feel,

76
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,120
but it's not nice to touch someone's sore spot like that.

77
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,459
Mr. Lee.

78
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,300
You know where Ms. Jung's father's funeral is taking place, right?

79
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,730
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

80
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,870
Take me there. Now.

81
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,199
Why do you want to go there?

82
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,939
Si Woo...

83
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,709
I think Si Woo is there.

84
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,810
Gosh, that's crazy.

85
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,250
Why would he go there?

86
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,019
You don't need to know the reason.

87
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,420
Will you take me there or not?

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
I can't drive because I drank.

89
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,959
Then I'll ask Mr. Jang to drive me, so just give me the address.

90
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,959
Gosh, that area is my turf.

91
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,470
Why would you ask Mr. Jang?

92
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,769
Hang on. Let me call Nam Jin.

93
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,209
Nam Jin?

94
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,149
We can stay a bit longer. Why do you want to leave already?

95
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,019
Si Woo is here now, you know.

96
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,649
He'll take care of everything now.

97
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,259
Yes, Mr. Lee.

98
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,129
Director Choi?

99
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,600
No, he's not here.

100
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,569
Of course. Why would he come here?

101
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,339
Okay, we'll be leaving shortly. All right.

102
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,079
I guess Ms. Choi has figured it out.

103
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,649
It seems so, doesn't it?

104
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,250
Why did you lie?

105
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,860
I wanted to protect Jin Ah's love.

106
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,730
Jin Ah's feelings for him are sincere.

107
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,439
You just can't stop talking about her, can you?

108
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,069
It's so sad I don't have anyone I've been friends with for 20 years.

109
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,709
We can stay friends for over 20 years starting now.

110
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,649
What's Ms. Jung like?

111
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,060
No, what did you like about her?

112
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,860
Having two different sides, I guess?

113
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,529
Two different sides?

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,199
Are you saying she's two-faced?

115
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,670
No.

116
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,870
She looks very delicate,

117
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,439
so I want to protect her and keep her safe.

118
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,810
However, she becomes stronger than me in moments of crisis.

119
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,350
And wanting to be confident in front of her...

120
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,120
makes me stronger.

121
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,250
She has that power.

122
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,759
I think you're like that too. Am I wrong?

123
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,929
I'm not like that.

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,259
I always punched boys who lifted up my skirt.

125
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,730
And I always protected the person I loved.

126
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,299
I am far from fragile.

127
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,639
When you had a break-in, you were pale and shaking in fear.

128
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,480
When did I shake in fear? Gosh.

129
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,179
Don't pretend you're strong.

130
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,519
You will end up struggling to live up to the image you created.

131
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,990
I'll struggle to live up to the image I created?

132
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,860
Listen.

133
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,830
If Jin Ah and I fell into the water,

134
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,799
who would you save first?

135
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,139
Well... Of course, I would save...

136
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,950
Don't answer that.

137
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,220
I think I'll be upset if you don't say what I want to hear.

138
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,830
I would save you first, Seung Joo.

139
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,440
- Are you serious? - Yes.

140
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,509
Jin Ah is so good at swimming.

141
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,649
What? I want to take back what we just did.

142
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,649
You can't undo what's already done.

143
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,120
I can do it again for you.

144
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,019
Forget it. What's wrong with you?

145
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,629
All right. Stop it.

146
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,230
See? Nam Jin said the same thing.

147
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,169
He said Mr. Choi wouldn't have gone there.

148
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,710
Is something...

149
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,240
going on between Mr. Choi and Jin Ah?

150
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,950
Nothing's going on between them.

151
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,649
Si Woo is just her supervisor.

152
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,480
Why would you get angry at me?

153
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,820
Do you think I'm a punching bag or something?

154
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,629
My angel, do you drink?

155
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,830
In fact, your son's engagement got canceled.

156
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:06,399
You need to drink on a day like this...

157
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,639
if it helps to comfort yourself.

158
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:11,039
Would you like another shot?

159
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,879
Yes, please.

160
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,750
I don't understand why Si Woo did that.

161
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,090
Until now, he has never...

162
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,519
done anything against his mother's wishes.

163
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,929
My angel, I know you're upset.

164
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,200
But you know you can't control your child's life.

165
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,169
You see,

166
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,570
I don't know where Seon Hui lives or what she does,

167
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,879
but I only hope she's happy.

168
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,779
Si Woo is different from your daughter.

169
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,879
What's different between them?

170
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,379
Both Mr. Choi, who is smart and got good grades at school,

171
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,850
and my daughter, who likes having fun,

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,889
are the most precious people in the world to their parents.

173
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,169
Ms. Choi, you shouldn't drink without eating food.

174
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,870
Please have some food.

175
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,570
I'm fine.

176
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,110
Shall I make you something else?

177
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,720
- Ms. Choi. - My angel.

178
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,049
Oh, gosh. What's the matter?

179
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,389
Are you all right?

180
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,759
What could be the problem?

181
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,830
We had her stomach washed out...

182
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,470
and gave her an injection for pain, so she'll be okay.

183
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,539
Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,169
She was born with a body that can't metabolize alcohol.

185
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,340
If she drinks alcohol again, her life could be in danger.

186
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,850
- So please make sure she won't. - I see.

187
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,210
I've never heard of that kind of condition.

188
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,700
How could you make Ms. Choi drink?

189
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,429
Well, I didn't make her drink.

190
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,470
She drank because she was upset.

191
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,909
We really didn't know about her unusual condition.

192
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,210
She even took a sedative. How could you let her drink?

193
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,450
She could have fallen into a coma.

194
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,620
Were you out of your mind?

195
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,100
Why didn't you tell me?

196
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,799
About what?

197
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,240
My mom told you that, right?

198
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,139
Junk food... She said that, right?

199
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,179
No.

200
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,610
I know.

201
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,820
My mom...

202
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,750
is more than capable of saying such a thing.

203
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,659
I'm sorry...

204
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,740
that you heard such a mean thing.

205
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,480
My mom is a very resentful person.

206
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,549
She was abandoned by my dad when she was pregnant.

207
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,250
She gave birth to and raised me all by herself.

208
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,889
When I was four,

209
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,059
I was sick and burning up with fever.

210
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,960
My mom became so afraid.

211
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,799
So she called my dad.

212
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,200
My dad, who drank,

213
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,409
drove in the rain and died in an accident.

214
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,850
Since my dad and my aunt passed away like that,

215
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,580
my mom became a sinner to that family.

216
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,659
My grandparents hated her until they passed away...

217
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,360
saying their son died because of her.

218
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,039
If me inheriting Hyunkang...

219
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,909
can be compensation for my mom's painful past,

220
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,379
would you be able to understand her?

221
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,049
If you know that,

222
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,250
you shouldn't do this.

223
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,049
No.

224
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,350
I canceled my engagement and came here...

225
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,059
because I was confident.

226
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,159
I would've benefited a lot from the engagement.

227
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,330
But I didn't want to...

228
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,299
give up on you just for the benefits.

229
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,870
Still, you can't do this.

230
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,409
I can't see you go through a hard time...

231
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,379
because of me.

232
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,649
I am not distressed at all.

233
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,289
In fact, I feel at ease.

234
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:24,919
I can be the successor of Hyunkang...

235
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,759
by competing only with my competency.

236
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,860
I don't know why I was so anxious.

237
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,700
I know that.

238
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,740
But still...

239
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,070
I'm a little afraid.

240
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,210
For a while,

241
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,350
my mom might give you a hard time.

242
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,789
However, whatever happens,

243
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,990
promise me one thing.

244
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,859
Never think of...

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,500
breaking up with me.

246
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,900
Don't be afraid.

247
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,740
From now on, I will be by your side.

248
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,289
Are you leaving now?

249
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,730
Thank you for coming.

250
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,559
- Dae Sik, go back safely. - Yes.

251
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,869
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

252
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,519
Are you done yet?

253
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,750
My angel must be hungry.

254
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,289
The more I think about it, the more ridiculous it gets.

255
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,930
Why should I attend to Ms. Choi when she's never been nice to me?

256
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:17,700
Is Ms. Choi hospitalized? Why?

257
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,400
Don't get me started.

258
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,740
While I was sleeping yesterday,

259
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,609
there was such a commotion.

260
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,009
Si Woo canceled his engagement and ran away,

261
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,049
and Ms. Choi collapsed.

262
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,619
- Did Ms. Choi collapse? - Yes.

263
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,589
I think she was devastated because the engagement got canceled.

264
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,789
Here you go.

265
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,460
Take this and get out of my sight.

266
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,660
Okay.

267
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,369
Yes, Mr. Heo.

268
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,170
Where are you now?

269
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,470
Okay, I'll go straight to the office.

270
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,710
No, it's okay. I have to go in because of our order anyway.

271
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,049
Okay, see you in a bit.

272
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,150
Do you have that much work to do?

273
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,920
You've been pulling all-nighters and working late.

274
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,049
You'll ruin your health.

275
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,519
Don't worry, Mom.

276
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,559
I'm strong and healthy, you know.

277
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,490
Hey, Nam Jin. By the way,

278
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:19,099
did everything go well at Jin Ah's dad's funeral?

279
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,130
Yes.

280
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,970
I'm not fond of that family, but I still should've gone.

281
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,740
I have too much on my mind because of Mr. Han's wife...

282
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,640
that I couldn't even pay my respect.

283
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,880
Well, you should at least call Jin Ah's mom.

284
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,750
She must be devastated.

285
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,079
Okay, I will. Eat up.

286
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,920
Okay.

287
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,829
I found out that Han Mi Ra is staying at Crown Hotel.

288
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:50,960
Meet me there.

289
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,970
I'll head over there right after my meeting with Mr. Heo.

290
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:02,970
Yes, come on in.

291
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,809
Mr. Koo, you're here too.

292
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,279
Hello, Mr. Ahn.

293
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,750
- I asked him to join us. - I see.

294
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,450
What did you want to talk to me about?

295
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,119
Mr. Koo will be Minhan's point of contact from now on.

296
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,220
We'll be giving you additional compensation for it.

297
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,619
Compensation?

298
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,829
Thank you, sir.

299
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,059
I know it's the weekend. I'm sorry I made you come in.

300
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,000
I feel bad for those who work for Minhan.

301
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,299
Because of the large volume, they've been operating their factory...

302
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,900
every single day including weekends.

303
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,769
Anyway, I'll be back later.

304
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,779
- Have a good day. - You too.

305
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,250
Mr. Han has agreed to manufacture for you until the third round.

306
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,119
But on the condition...

307
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,990
that someone else becomes their point of contact.

308
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,299
I see. I understand.

309
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,940
He lost his baby due to Ms. Yang's mistake.

310
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,839
Whether they want to forgive her or not is solely up to them,

311
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,440
but you and Ms. Yang...

312
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,579
must do your best so that they can recover from what happened.

313
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,819
Yes.

314
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,289
Thank you for your help.

315
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,390
As always, I owe you.

316
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,089
No, you don't owe me anything.

317
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,660
I'm simply trying to maintain the balance of power...

318
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,589
as per Chairman Ahn's wishes.

319
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,529
The balance of power?

320
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,329
It's what makes any competition possible.

321
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,210
If one side is weaker than the other, it'll be pointless.

322
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,579
You've been helping me out more so far,

323
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,349
so I must be substantially weaker than Si Woo.

324
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,349
No, that's not true.

325
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,980
I've been advising both of you in the same way,

326
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,319
but only you are accepting my advice.

327
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,289
Pardon me?

328
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,930
My gosh, are you all right?

329
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,269
Where am I now?

330
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:16,640
You're at the hospital.

331
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,680
Where's Si Woo?

332
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,609
Has he called?

333
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,980
Not yet.

334
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,019
- I should get going. - No, you can't leave yet.

335
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,390
You should stay here today.

336
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,259
Si Woo must be home by now.

337
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,099
- We'll reschedule his engagement... - Ms. Choi.

338
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,029
Stop now. Please.

339
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,710
No, I can't.

340
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,880
Do you know how I've come this far?

341
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,109
Why do you think I've been putting up...

342
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,480
with all the humiliation and insults to this day?

343
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,119
- I can't stop. - I understand how you feel.

344
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:04,650
But you see,

345
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,819
you can't use your son to satisfy your grudge.

346
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,359
This isn't because of my grudge.

347
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,759
Si Woo wanted it too.

348
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,869
- I don't have time for this. - Wait, Ms. Choi.

349
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,970
Just get the injection at least. Leave after you get the injection.

350
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,539
Ms. Choi, you should eat something.

351
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,250
By the way, why is this room so cold?

352
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,079
Is the heat off?

353
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:33,880
Proceed with the discharge procedure for me, Mr. Jang.

354
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,990
All right.

355
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,460
I'll be right back. Get some rest.

356
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,339
My angel, did you cry?

357
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,009
Don't cry.

358
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,579
If you cry, my heart...

359
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,279
will shatter to pieces.

360
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,130
- Please tell us. - Yes, please.

361
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,130
We're telling you the truth. She's really her sister.

362
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,069
Please believe me. I'm Miranda Han's sister.

363
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,299
I still can't tell you.

364
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,940
We cannot disclose our guests' personal information.

365
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,710
You're so strict.

366
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,940
Then give her a call at least. Please?

367
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,849
Please leave a note for her. We'll make sure she gets it.

368
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,670
Mr. Ahn!

369
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,740
- What took you so long? - I'm sorry.

370
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,750
The meeting with Mr. Heo went on for longer.

371
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,049
You two are here even though it's your day off.

372
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,819
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard for you.

373
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,920
I managed to find out that she's staying at this hotel,

374
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,690
but we can't get more information.

375
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,619
They're saying they can't disclose their guests' personal information.

376
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,789
They told us to leave a note for her, so we did.

377
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,559
But I'm not sure if we'll hear from her.

378
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,029
Really? Then we should wait.

379
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,269
Sorry? Where? Here?

380
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,740
You two can call it a day.

381
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,109
Seung Joo and I will wait for her.

382
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,650
What? Gosh, why are you dragging me into this?

383
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,009
You always pick on me like this.

384
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,750
You saw Han Mi Ra most recently.

385
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,819
That is true,

386
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:52,190
but what if she doesn't leave her room today?

387
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,420
Well, she may have gone somewhere.

388
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,130
She'll leave her room at some point.

389
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,089
And if she's out now, she'll be back eventually.

390
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,029
You're really something.

391
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,099
You're so optimistic. No, you just don't think.

392
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,269
I give you that.

393
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,700
We'll be off, then.

394
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,210
Keep bickering at each other, and you won't be bored.

395
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,839
We'll get going, then.

396
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,180
All right, thank you.

397
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:15,849
- Have a good day. - Bye.

398
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,650
How about rock-paper-scissors to entertain ourselves?

399
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,119
Forget it.

400
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,160
- What's wrong with him? - How about a variation of it?

401
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,730
Oh, my goodness.

402
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,809
Don't think about anything...

403
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,509
and get as much sleep as you can.

404
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,779
Okay?

405
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,480
Yes, I will.

406
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,589
Go in.

407
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,619
Are the two of them really dating?

408
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,789
My goodness. Jung Jin Ah, that sly wench.

409
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,890
Mr. Choi is totally bewitched by her.

410
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,490
I'll teach her a lesson.

411
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,599
- My gosh. - Be careful.

412
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,269
Are you all right?

413
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:23,369
- Give me a glass of water. - I'll get it for you.

414
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,210
By the way,

415
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,710
why did Si Woo do such a thing?

416
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,079
Why call off his engagement and go to Jin Ah's dad's funeral?

417
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,289
I just don't understand.

418
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:42,329
Si Woo went to that funeral?

419
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,829
Who said that?

420
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,490
(It's My Life)

421
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,160
If you don't give up on her, I will die.

422
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,220
Mom.

423
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,289
You made Mr. Choi cancel his engagement and went to the funeral.

424
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,829
How did you approach him?

425
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:22,029
Why should I tell you about my relationship with Mr. Choi?

426
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,470
Where did you get this stuffed dolphin?

427
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,339
I picked it up in the hallway.

428
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,269
- Miranda. - Seung Joo. What's going on?

429
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,710
What are you doing here?
