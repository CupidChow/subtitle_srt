1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,660
Episode 25

16
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,910
What are you looking at?

17
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Look at that cloud!

18
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,190
You're so relaxed and carefree today.

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,120
Doesn't it look like a pile of silver?

20
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,950
That's definitely your style.

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,230
What if

22
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,160
I took all the silver back?

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,960
How happy my wife and daughter

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,390
would be!

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,830
Are we going back to the Fan mansion?

26
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,390
Wang Qinian,

27
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,320
have you ever heard of Zhuang Mohan?

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,000
I have.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,550
He arrived in the capital city today.

30
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,600
All the scholars in the capital city

31
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,160
went to pay respects to him.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,080
He's so respected!

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,830
It's known to all the scholars that

34
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,110
Zhuang Mohan is a literary giant,

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,830
a living saint

36
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,600
in the world,

37
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,670
and the teacher to all scholars.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,030
Don't you know that?

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,880
Aren't you a scholar, too?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm not.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,390
You're so modest.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
You've written poems

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
with universal praise.

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
You're definitely a scholar!

45
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,720
Let's go.

46
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,030
What's up?

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,260
Master Shadow.

48
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,080
=Shadow, Director of the Sixth Division=
Master Shadow.

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,180
=Shadow, Director of the Sixth Division
of the Nanqing Investigator's Office=

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,270
Does Chen Pingping have anything for me?

51
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,750
Someone wants to kill the Head.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,880
In the world,

53
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,960
a lot of people want to kill him.

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
They will attack in less than an hour.

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,000
Where is he?

56
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,470
In the Investigator's Office.

57
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,240
Then he'll be fine.

58
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,320
Without massive forces,

59
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,830
no one can break into
the Investigator's Office to kill him.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,030
Now no one

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,800
is protecting the Head.

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,630
What do you mean?

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
Zhuang Mohan has arrived in the capital city.

64
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,110
How is Zhuang Mohan

65
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,080
relevant to this?

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,080
Zhuang Mohan's arrival

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,750
leads to the change.

68
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,720
Everyone in the Investigator's Office knows that

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,750
the only way to restart the war

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,880
is to assassinate Zhuang Mohan.

71
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,270
But the Head has sent the First Division

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
to protect Zhuang Mohan.

73
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,550
Right.

74
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,440
Zhu Ge from the First Division

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,600
has led all his men out.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,000
Fei Jie from the Third Division is not in the capital city.

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,240
Martial arts masters from other divisions

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
have been sent out by me respectively.

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,600
Today, all the officials inside

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the Investigator's Office are on our side.

81
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,440
Even so, we don't have enough men

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,190
to kill Zhuang Mohan.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Zhuang Mohan is just a cover.

84
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,240
The person we're really going to kill

85
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,160
is Chen Pingping.

86
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,640
You're here.

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,160
We have no way out.

88
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,950
Let's go to the dungeon.

89
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,160
You all know that

90
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,790
Chen Pingping is the person

91
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,640
preventing us from restarting the war

92
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,600
in the Investigator's Office.

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,760
If he dies,

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,230
the Investigator's Office will be controlled

95
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,880
by loyal people like us.

96
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,550
By then, it will be very easy

97
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,720
to motivate His Majesty

98
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,230
to destroy Beiqi.

99
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,390
He's also a man.

100
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,480
I've exhausted my abilities

101
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,550
to create a favorable situation for us.

102
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,920
If we don't kill him today, we won't have a second chance.

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,350
Kill Chen Pingping! Kill Chen Pingping!

104
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,950
Kill Chen Pingping!

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,230
Once Chen Pingping is killed,

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,070
the Investigator's Office

107
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,920
will be controlled by us.

108
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,790
What's done is done.

109
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,640
There's no way back.

110
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,270
Let's do it!

111
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,440
Kill Chen Pingping! Kill Chen Pingping!

112
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,600
Kill Chen Pingping!

113
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,600
Mr. Fan?

114
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,510
Miss Lili, let's talk later.

115
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,320
We're being hunted.

116
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,000
Hunted?

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,950
Press that.

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,720
It leads to

119
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,110
the deepest part of the dungeon,

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,200
where the most vicious villains

121
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
are locked up inside.

122
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,830
Let's get inside first.

123
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,160
Are we safe here?

124
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,350
Not really.

125
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,110
Many people know this path.

126
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,200
They usually deliver water

127
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,510
and food to the prisoners.

128
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,110
Sometimes,

129
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,350
they have to pull out the bodies.

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,880
Then what's the point of hiding here?

131
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,320
It's narrow inside. Maybe we can resist them for a while.

132
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,390
Then we'll have to die sooner or later.

133
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,760
It's a dead end.

134
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,670
This is terrible!

135
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,230
I can't die.

136
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,160
I haven't told my wife yet.

137
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,440
If I die without her permission,

138
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,720
she will definitely be angry.

139
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,550
We're in great danger,

140
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,200
yet you're afraid your wife might be angry.

141
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,200
Life or death, it doesn't matter.

142
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,350
What really matters is
whether I've gained permission from my wife or not.

143
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
You don't understand.

144
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,760
What will happen to Si Lili outside?

145
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,830
They want to kill me.

146
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,760
They won't leave anyone alive.

147
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,790
Give me the key to her cell.

148
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,270
You can't even protect yourself. Why care about others?

149
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,110
The key!

150
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,200
Wait a minute.

151
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,200
He's a good lad.

152
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,070
What's the sound?

153
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,510
What's the sound?

154
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,950
Is there an internal strife in the Investigator's Office?

155
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,270
Why do you save me?

156
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,270
Hurry up!

157
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,350
They could rush in any minute.

158
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,830
Kill Chen Pingping! Kill Chen Pingping!

159
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,390
Kill Chen Pingping!

160
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,670
Kill him!

161
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,320
What's the point of

162
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,040
bringing me here?

163
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,320
I still have to die.

164
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,640
I've promised you to protect you.

165
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,790
Even if you have to die,

166
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,110
you must die after me.

167
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,350
Go inside.

168
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,030
Your Excellency.

169
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,110
What's this?

170
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,400
I've told you about

171
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,640
the prisoners locked up here.

172
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,470
The most vicious villains?

173
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,640
Right.

174
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,640
One of them is still alive.

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,400
So many chains are used to lock up only one person?

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
Yes, only one.

177
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,470
Will your life be saved after looking at him?

178
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,590
This way.

179
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,520
He's not here.

180
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,440
Hurry up and find Chen Pingping!

181
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,840
He's not here.

182
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
No, He's not here. He's not here.

183
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
He's not here.

184
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,520
Where is he?

185
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,440
Go inside and find him!

186
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,520
He's not here.

187
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,440
Wait a moment!

188
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm going to die.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,960
Can I at least satisfy

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,590
my curiosity?

191
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,230
Is he really dangerous?

192
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,320
Indeed!

193
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,910
His name is Xiao En.

194
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,840
I was paralyzed because of him.

195
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
Chen Pingping is inside.

196
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,840
He has no way to go.

197
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,470
-Kill him! -Come on!

198
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,840
Kill him!

199
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,710
-Kill him! -Kill Chen Pingping!

200
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,520
They've opened the door

201
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
to the secret path.

202
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,200
-Kill Chen Pingping! -Kill Chen Pingping!

203
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,550
Catch him!

204
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,320
Si Lili.

205
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,760
What?

206
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,520
Beiqi is defeated.

207
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,080
Why do you tell me that?

208
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,670
I'm nervous. I have to say something.

209
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,200
Actually there's another way

210
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,030
to save our lives.

211
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,000
They only want to kill Chen Pingping.

212
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,910
Do you believe they will

213
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,710
let us go?

214
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,400
We can kill him first.

215
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,110
Then we can trade his head for our lives.

216
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,440
This is the only way to save our lives.

217
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,470
Wang Qinian.

218
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,470
Your Excellency.

219
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,080
Let's take the risk.

220
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,910
OK.

221
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,520
What are you doing?

222
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,320
Just wait.

223
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,320
It's Shadow! He's alone!

224
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,150
Kill him!

225
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,840
-He's alone! -Kill him!

226
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,880
Kill him!

227
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,080
All the men outside are martial arts masters.

228
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,280
How long can he hold by himself?

229
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,710
The noise of fighting is further and further away from us.

230
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,470
He has killed a way out?

231
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,760
Are those opponents

232
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,550
too weak?

233
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,840
They are all martial arts masters above the Seventh Dan.

234
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,110
It's really not my idea.

235
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,200
What did you just say?

236
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,080
Shadow wants to test you.

237
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,840
It's not my idea.

238
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,880
What?

239
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Test me?

240
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,150
Are those men outside acting?

241
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,200
They do want to kill me.

242
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,790
Are there other martial arts masters

243
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,590
ambushing in the dark?

244
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,590
There aren't any reinforcements.

245
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,280
Then why do you say it's a test?

246
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,200
Shadow alone can resist one thousand cavalrymen.

247
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,840
I don't know.

248
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,320
I've never seen Master Shadow

249
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
in a fight.

250
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,670
Si Lili,

251
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,150
just now when Shadow left

252
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,710
and the other two

253
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,960
were not by my side,

254
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,230
I thought you would hold me hostage.

255
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,110
That might be your last chance

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,520
to escape.

257
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,960
I know.

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Why did you hesitate?

259
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,910
I dared not.

260
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,080
In Beiqi,

261
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,470
Chen Pingping

262
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,670
is as scary as demons.

263
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,470
Push me out.

264
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,640
Chen Pingping,

265
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,910
don't die. Wait for me to get out.

266
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,030
He's afraid I might be killed by others.

267
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,670
He won't get out.

268
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,910
Let's go.

269
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,080
So you knew

270
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
they wanted to kill you?

271
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,790
Yes.

272
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,520
Yet you just let them.

273
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,350
Independent from the Six
Ministries, the Investigator's Office

274
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,440
is an important organization with great power.

275
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,670
Though I'm the Head,

276
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,520
I can't guard against the world.

277
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,150
There will always be organizations

278
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,910
finding ways to plant agents

279
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,910
who are good at hiding themselves.

280
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,550
By giving them the chance to kill me,

281
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,880
they would jump out

282
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,520
and be exposed once and for all.

283
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,400
Wang Qinian.

284
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,150
Use yourself as bait.

285
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,150
Smart as they are,

286
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,400
they wouldn't be tricked

287
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,710
without seeing me.

288
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,440
We've walked a long way,

289
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,710
but we've seen no one alive.

290
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,590
This is the consequence of walking into a trap.

291
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,110
I find it safer inside.

292
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,710
There's no sound outside.

293
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,640
It should be safe.

294
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,760
Would you find me ruthless?

295
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,710
They want to kill others.

296
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,280
It's natural for them to be killed.

297
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,910
Moving forward with a heavy burden,

298
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,550
they just can't help it.

299
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,790
Wang Qinian, open the door.

300
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,760
The jade is good.

301
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,400
Head.

302
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I saw Shadow killing our colleagues

303
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,520
when I came back to the Investigator's Office.

304
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,110
I asked him to.

305
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,830
You should be monitoring

306
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,230
Zhuang Mohan from Beiqi.

307
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,950
Why are you back?

308
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,800
Something is wrong.

309
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,000
Zhuang Mohan is missing.

310
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,430
Upon arrival in the capital city,

311
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,160
Zhuang Mohan stayed

312
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,310
in the residence arranged by
the Court of State Ceremonials,

313
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
and never came out.

314
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,350
I found it strange,

315
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,920
so I asked my man to dress up as

316
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,710
a servant to clean the room.

317
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,000
Master Zhuang.

318
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,800
May I clean your room?

319
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,640
Master Zhuang.

320
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,800
It turned out that

321
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
Zhuang Mohan was not there.

322
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,280
Who visited him before?

323
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,830
Officials from Imperial College, Ministry of Personnel,

324
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Ministry of Rites, and Censorate

325
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,560
all visited him.

326
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
It seems that they really admire Zhuang Mohan,

327
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,350
so they consulted him in person.

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,800
Then why did they

329
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,400
sneak him out?

330
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,640
Head,

331
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,710
Zhuang Mohan is a literary giant.

332
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,190
His words and behaviors can influence

333
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,160
the scholars all over the world.

334
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,950
Now he's missing.

335
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm afraid it's a big deal.

336
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,400
List the visitors

337
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,640
for me.

338
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,710
Yes.

339
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,160
I come back to ask for your order

340
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,000
to investigate the capital city

341
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,230
thoroughly.

342
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,560
Just forget it.

343
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
Now you're back.

344
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,350
Call back all the Directors

345
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,400
in the capital city.

346
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
I have something to say.

347
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,350
Yes.

348
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,160
Head. Your Excellency.

349
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,190
I should go back home

350
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,640
to see my wife.

351
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,430
I'm also leaving if everything is fine.

352
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,560
Wait.

353
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,110
You should meet them.

354
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,800
Everyone is here.

355
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Let me introduce them to you.

356
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,800
Zhu Ge, Director of the First Division.

357
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,230
Yan Ruohai, Director of the Fourth Division.

358
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,920
You've met them before.

359
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,310
The Director of the Second Division

360
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,350
is working in the frontier.

361
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,230
Black knights, Director of the Fifth Division,

362
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,040
is not in the capital city.

363
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,310
Shadow, Director of the Sixth Division.

364
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,640
Director of the Seventh Division

365
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,760
is still working in the Jiangnan area.

366
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,680
Xuan Jiu, Director of the Eighth Division.

367
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:21,880
=Xuan Jiu, Director of the Eighth Division
of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=

368
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,800
=Xuan Jiu, Director of the Eighth Division=
He's in charge of book publishing.

369
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:23,900
=Xuan Jiu, Director of the Eighth Division
of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=

370
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,680
You just opened a bookstore, right?

371
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,920
He's in charge of that.

372
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,230
Your Excellency Xuan, good day.

373
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,640
The last one is Fei Jie,

374
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,110
Director of the Third Division.

375
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,230
Fei Jie is not here.

376
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,000
The man taking over the Third Division

377
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,350
for the moment is lying over there.

378
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,950
Is he dead?

379
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,420
=Senior Fellow Apprentice Leng, Acting Director of
the Third Division of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=

380
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,070
This is Fan Xian, Director-General of our Office.

381
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,430
Your Excellencies, good day.

382
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,310
Here comes my junior fellow apprentice.

383
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,040
I'm surnamed Leng. I'm also a student of Master Fei.

384
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,230
So we have the same teacher.

385
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,040
Senior Fellow Apprentice Leng, what's wrong with you?

386
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,280
I developed a new poison.

387
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,640
I took some.

388
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,520
It's good.

389
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,560
Didn't you make the antidote?

390
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,040
I failed.

391
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,280
It's getting worse.

392
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,800
You work so hard.

393
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,680
When I get better, I'll invite you to dinner.

394
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,310
I'll cook myself.

395
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,880
Please don't. No need to bother you.

396
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,950
Fine.

397
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,950
I need some rest now.

398
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Now we've all met.

399
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,280
I'll come straight to the point.

400
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,560
Today, someone set a trap here

401
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
to kill me.

402
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,190
Fan Xian saved me.

403
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,040
It was Shadow, right?

404
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,310
I saw him.

405
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,230
You're mistaken.

406
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm old.

407
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,230
In future, Fan Xian can take my place.

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,070
You should look after him.

409
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,000
Fan Xian is new to the capital city.

410
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,110
He doesn't know us all.

411
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,710
It's no hurry.

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm not retiring now.

413
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,070
Head,

414
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,190
the Investigator's Office

415
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,430
is the most important organization in Nanqing.

416
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,400
Not anyone can be the Head.

417
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,800
To me,

418
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,560
Fan Xian is not qualified.

419
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,950
Are you mistaken?

420
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,310
I'm not here to asking for your approval.

421
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm just telling you.

422
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,950
I think it's good.

423
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
I don't know about others,

424
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,830
but our Third Division will definitely

425
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,950
support our junior fellow apprentice.

426
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,950
I'll say it for the last time.

427
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,430
It's settled. It won't be changed.

428
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,880
Whoever feels dissatisfied

429
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,560
should find the chance to kill me.

430
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,190
Go.

431
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,230
We've been through a lot these years.

432
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,830
I originally thought you would be the one

433
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,310
to take over the Investigator's Office.

434
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,110
But his decision today

435
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
is really disappointing.

436
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,280
Yan Ruohai,

437
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,280
let me be clear on one point.

438
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,560
I don't want to fight for power.

439
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
I'm not competent enough

440
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
to take that position.

441
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,950
I understand.

442
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,950
You don't.

443
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,190
Everything I've done

444
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,400
is for Nanqing.

445
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,000
I know.

446
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,920
I've checked the bodies of

447
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,880
those assassinations.

448
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,710
They were bodacious.

449
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,560
Right.

450
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,310
Quite a few of them

451
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,430
had visited you frequently these days.

452
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,430
Why didn't you tell the Head just now?

453
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,880
Yan Ruohai, what on earth are you up to?

454
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,110
Just like you, all my decisions are made

455
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,470
for the benefits of Nanqing.

456
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,110
Why?

457
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,160
What are you asking about?

458
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
Handing the Investigator's Office over to me.

459
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,640
Shadow took the liberty

460
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
to test you. That's fine.

461
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,430
We can make things clear.

462
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,800
Zhu Ge is right.

463
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,230
I'm not qualified yet.

464
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
The Investigator's Office

465
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,160
was founded by your mother.

466
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,110
For all these years,

467
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,040
I've been guarding this place for her.

468
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,830
But I'll have to

469
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,590
return it to you after all.

470
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,280
Circumstances change with the passage of time.

471
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,640
The time may have passed,

472
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,230
but my original intension remains the same.

473
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,430
You've been to the Court of State Ceremonials, right?

474
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,800
It's a good thing.

475
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,920
Peace negotiation after war

476
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,800
is important to the whole county. Take it seriously.

477
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,640
I see.

478
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
Just do your work.

479
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,560
Tell me

480
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,470
if anything bothers you.

481
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,760
Tell me also

482
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,350
if anyone makes it hard for you.

483
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,040
I'll help you out.

484
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,520
Anything?

485
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,350
Anything!

486
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,160
However difficult it might be,

487
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,350
I'll handle it for you.

488
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,590
Go back.

489
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,110
You must be tired today.

490
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,160
It's getting colder at night.

491
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,190
Add more quilts to keep warm.

492
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,880
You're still coughing.

493
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
I'm old.

494
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
It takes time to get better.

495
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,760
I'll grab you some medicine later.

496
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,160
Good.

497
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,800
The heaven, earth and man exist in harmony.

498
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,070
Gentlemen shall not stay up for work.

499
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,470
It's midnight already.

500
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,160
You're upset.

501
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,710
I've been to the imperial palace.

502
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,800
Ruoruo has drawn down the map

503
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,520
to the Empress Dowager's palace,

504
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,160
and I've remembered it.

505
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,830
Then why are you upset?

506
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,520
The Niulan Street assassination

507
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,520
was planned by the Princess Royal.

508
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,830
The person planned the assassination

509
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,160
was actually comforting the target.

510
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,760
Isn't that funny?

511
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,880
Chen Pingping said

512
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,830
he would hand the Investigator's Office over to me.

513
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,880
He asked me to tell him

514
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,640
if anything bothers me.

515
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,280
Tell me also

516
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
if anyone makes it hard for you.

517
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,190
I almost told him about

518
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,110
the Princess Royal.

519
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,880
If you want to kill someone, I'm a better choice.

520
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,230
Do you want to kill the Princess Royal?

521
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,070
She's the mother of Wan'er after all.

522
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,920
Do you want to kill her?

523
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,560
The Princess Royal values power over life.

524
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,760
We should take her down
and kick her out of the capital city.

525
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,230
To her, that's even worse than death.

526
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,400
That is beyond my ability.

527
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,040
I'll do it myself.

528
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,350
As you wish.

529
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,070
Uncle.

530
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,070
We should postpone our plan of

531
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
breaking into the imperial harem to steal the key.

532
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,000
We should wait for a better chance.

533
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,160
It's up to you.

534
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,560
Uncle.

535
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,640
Do you know?

536
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,160
Shadow from the Investigator's Office

537
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,070
is really good at martial arts.

538
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,470
I know.

539
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,070
Is he a Great Master?

540
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,590
He's above the Ninth Dan.

541
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,640
Aren't there only a few

542
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,590
martial arts masters above the Ninth Dan in Nanqing?

543
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,760
Uncle.

544
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,190
Have you ever seen

545
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,520
Shadow's face?

546
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,470
No.

547
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,880
Uncle, do you know?

548
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,350
I've been to the deepest part of

549
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,000
the dungeon in the Investigator's Office.

550
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,230
A man was locked up there.

551
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,640
It's so scary.

552
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,400
He was locked up by chains all over.

553
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,560
Please.

554
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,830
Your Excellency, you're the Deputy Receptionist.

555
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,110
Please sit here.

556
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,230
OK.

557
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,400
Your Excellency,

558
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,640
I've never negotiated with an enemy country.

559
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,520
I feel a bit nervous.

560
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,920
I don't know what to say later.

561
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,710
Take it easy.

562
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,000
Negotiation is a verbal battle between two countries.

563
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,230
The most important thing is to

564
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,190
mind our choice of words.

565
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,000
We should be kind and generous when talking.

566
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,590
In other words, we should be polite and courteous.

567
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,000
Only then can we demonstrate

568
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,640
the dignity and magnanimity of a powerful country.

569
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,640
Anyway, later

570
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,680
just leave it all

571
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,560
to me.

572
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
OK!

573
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,400
We definitely won't return you

574
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,470
the prefecture taken by our powerful army.

575
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,760
That is our territory.

576
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,110
Your territory?

577
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,110
Really? If you want it back,

578
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,950
just send your troops.

579
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,950
How about this?

580
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,110
I'll announce that

581
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,920
the talk is suspended.

582
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,430
We can resume our talk

583
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,430
after the battle.

584
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,310
Will that work for you?

585
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,590
You! You are despicable!

586
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,590
I know how shameless you are

587
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,190
long before!

588
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,920
Is that real?

589
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Of course.

590
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,830
Let me tell you in detail.

591
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,920
Mr. Zhang,

592
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,800
this way, please.

593
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,710
Let's discuss the details in my mansion.

594
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,160
The specialty wine of this house

595
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,070
is really good.

596
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,070
Waiter!

597
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,110
Coming!

598
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,710
Waiter, come here!

599
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,520
Change the music for me.

600
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,560
OK.

601
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,710
Your Excellency,

602
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,950
we should resume the talk

603
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,680
in the afternoon.

604
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,830
So we'd better drink no wine.

605
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,920
That's the right music.

606
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,560
It suits us scholars the best.

607
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,830
Your Excellency,

608
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,640
are we going a bit far

609
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,950
in the talk just now?

610
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,000
We should be aggressive.

611
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,520
Don't we have to demonstrate dignity
and magnanimity of our country?

612
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,230
Our soldiers risked their lives

613
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,070
to win the battle.

614
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,920
If we're not aggressive,

615
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,590
we fail those soldiers.

616
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,400
Nice tea.

617
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,560
Its fragrance is lingering,

618
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,350
and its taste is profound.

619
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,590
The prefecture occupied by our army

620
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,760
will not be returned. Moreover,

621
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,160
you'll have to pay for

622
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,710
the marching expenditure of our army.

623
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,110
How can we continue our talk if you keep acting like that?

624
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,590
There's nothing to talk about in the first place.

625
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,520
Your Excellency Xin, we won't

626
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,880
concede in this talk.

627
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,520
Are you suddenly out of your mind?

628
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,190
There's a piece of new information on the paper.

629
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,760
All our conditions are on it.

630
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,070
You can have a look.

631
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,470
We'll talk tomorrow.

632
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,520
You can check the authenticity of the information.

633
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,470
Gosh! It's bad news!

634
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,470
This is a secret report sent from Beiqi just now.

635
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,190
Head, you want to see me.

636
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,670
There's something you should know.

637
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,630
Bingyun was held hostage.

638
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,470
The Imperial Guards of Beiqi did it.

639
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,120
Shen Zhong caught Bingyun in person.

640
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,040
Is he still alive?

641
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,390
Yes.

642
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,800
Beiqi wants to use him

643
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,950
as a bargaining chip.

644
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,150
What do they want?

645
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,080
Firstly,

646
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,150
they want to take back the prefecture.

647
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,320
Secondly, they ask us

648
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,080
to release the prisoners of war

649
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,470
and compensate for the dead soldiers.

650
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,630
The last

651
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,000
is the most hateful.

652
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,000
They want to exchange Mr. Yan

653
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,040
for Xiao En and Si Lili.

654
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,870
Xiao En?

655
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,670
The one locked up in the dungeon
of the Investigator's Office?

656
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,520
Right.

657
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,080
He is a vicious villain

658
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,280
from Beiqi.

659
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,390
He was equally famous as Chen Pingping.

660
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,390
Back then, Chen Pingping led

661
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,600
the black knights on a long-range raid

662
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,630
and caught him back

663
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,760
at the cost of his legs.

664
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,040
How can we send him back?

665
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,230
That's right.

666
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,800
But we won this battle

667
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,560
so easily because Yan Bingyun

668
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,800
inquired about military information

669
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,950
and sent us secret reports.

670
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,280
Moreover,

671
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,430
he's the son of

672
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,950
Yan Ruohai from the Investigator's Office.

673
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,000
No way!

674
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,630
We can't return the land we've taken!

675
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,190
We can't return the land we've taken.

676
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,190
Actually, what they really want

677
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,040
are Xiao En and Si Lili.

678
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
We can't let Xiao En go.

679
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,870
If he goes back to Beiqi,

680
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,120
he will retaliate like a mad dog!

681
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,120
As a citizen of Nanqing,

682
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,520
I can't accept that.

683
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,040
We don't release him for nothing.

684
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,630
It's an exchange.

685
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,190
We can get Bingyun back.

686
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,080
I'll go north tonight

687
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,520
to sneak into the capital of Beiqi,

688
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,870
so as to save my son.

689
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,360
It's extremely difficult to go north

690
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,520
and save him.

691
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,670
As a father,

692
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,470
I have to go.

693
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,150
Exchange or not, it's not up to you.

694
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,430
Head!

695
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,320
Nor me!

696
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,630
Only one man can make the call.

697
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,520
Eunuch Hou.

698
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,280
Yes.

699
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,190
Ask the Investigator's Office
to release Xiao En and Si Lili right away.

700
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,600
Your Majesty!

701
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,430
Also,

702
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,120
tell the Court of State Ceremonials that

703
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,600
no land taken by my army

704
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,710
shall be returned. Not an inch!

705
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,230
The rest are open for discussion.

706
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,710
Yan Bingyun

707
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,470
must be back alive.

708
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

709
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,760
That's the decision of His Majesty.

710
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,910
We can't let Xiao En go!

711
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,710
Your Excellency Yan,

712
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,390
His Majesty has a verbal instruction.

713
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,950
His Majesty knows

714
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,120
what kind of a person Xiao En is.

715
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,430
If the Investigator's Office can catch him once,

716
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,000
then you surely can catch him twice.

717
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,870
By bearing disgrace and a heavy burden,

718
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,910
Yan Bingyun lurked in the capital of Beiqi.

719
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,360
He's worked his heart out.

720
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,910
I've known it all.

721
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,710
Exchanging a dying old man

722
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,360
for a promising young man of our county,

723
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,520
it's really worth it!

724
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,190
Your Excellency Yan and the rest of you,

725
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,840
His Majesty also said that

726
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,120
Young Master Yan should come back alive.

727
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,560
I

728
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,390
accept the imperial edict
and thank His Majesty for showing mercy!

729
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,000
We thank His Majesty for showing mercy!

730
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,360
Fan Xian, give me the token for Director-General.

731
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,360
Give it to me!

732
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,600
Fan Xian,

733
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,360
we'll meet again.

734
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,560
Your Majesty,

735
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,710
The Court of State Ceremonials and Beiqi mission

736
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,390
have reached an agreement.

737
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,000
Dongyi mission

738
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,520
has offered all their gifts

739
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,120
and is ready to leave.

740
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,630
Despite the twists and turns,

741
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,710
the Court of State Ceremonials has done a good job.

742
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,230
Pass on my order.

743
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,150
A banquet will be held
at the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest tomorrow night

744
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,600
for a joint celebration.

745
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,800
Yes.

746
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,040
Wait.

747
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,280
Invite the Beiqi and Dongyi missions to the banquet.

748
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,520
Hurry up!

749
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,390
I see. I'll handle it.

750
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,840
At the banquet tomorrow night, Nanqing officials,

751
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,080
Beiqi courtiers, and Dongyi mission

752
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,560
will have a joyous gathering.

753
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,520
What an event!

754
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,520
What about Zhuang Mohan?

755
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,430
Who?

756
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,600
Zhuang Mohan.

757
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
He didn't seem to take part in the negotiation.

758
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,230
Indeed!

759
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,320
He disappeared once upon arrival in the capital city.

760
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,000
After that, he's never left his room.

761
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,000
He does nothing

762
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,080
but reading books quietly.

763
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,280
That's weird.

764
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,560
A literary giant came all the way

765
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,430
to the capital city

766
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,230
without achieving anything,

767
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,760
only to enjoy a banquet tomorrow night.

768
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,390
If anything happens in that banquet,

769
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,710
the world will know it in no time.

770
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,320
Head, you mean

771
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,120
Zhuang Mohan will make a move

772
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,150
in the banquet.

773
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,910
If he's up to something,
he must make a move tomorrow night.

774
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,120
Then what should we do?

775
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,190
Nothing.

776
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,390
Just wait and see.

777
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,910
Will we lose the initiative?

778
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,560
There's no other way.

779
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,630
Without knowing what he's been up to,

780
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,230
we certainly can't take any precautions.

781
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,840
One more thing.

782
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,560
According to the information sent from Beiqi,

783
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,320
my son was caught

784
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,870
because his identity was disclosed.

785
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,710
By secret agents from Beiqi?

786
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,910
No, not from Beiqi.

787
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,080
You mean from the capital city?

788
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,080
He was betrayed by someone from the capital city.

789
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,320
Bingyun lurking in Beiqi

790
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,040
is a top secret.

791
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,870
Besides His Majesty,

792
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:50,470
only officials from

793
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,760
our Investigator's Office know it.

794
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,670
Can it be someone from our office?

795
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,870
Why not?

796
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,280
Head.

797
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,000
I think we should carry out

798
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,080
a thorough investigation right away.

799
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,230
No need.

800
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,230
It's a serious problem.

801
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,390
It ends now.

802
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,120
Never mention it again.

803
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,000
Yes.

804
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,800
The Investigator's Office has
been established for so many years.

805
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,430
Time passes so quickly.

806
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,600
It's time to replace some old stuff.

807
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,820
In the river of history,

808
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,020
time goes round and round.

809
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,380
Memories about the former and present lives

810
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,260
join each other in an endless way.

811
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,860
In the long drunken Milky Way,

812
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,580
one season follows another in a flash,

813
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,780
and the wild geese are flying south.

814
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,700
I just can't give up

815
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,700
to be with you for my whole life.

816
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,980
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

817
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,780
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

818
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,660
Year after year in the wandering,

819
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,220
I count the remaining years.

820
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,420
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

821
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,980
even though we have ended up the destiny,

822
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,660
I never feel regretful.

823
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,620
In such a chaotic world,

824
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,380
I still miss you as ever.

825
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,020
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

826
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,740
With a gentle heart,

827
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,300
I cherish our remaining years.

828
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,140
Even though we have to go through

829
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,100
all the hardships along the journey,

830
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:08,420
you always stay by my side,

831
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,180
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

832
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,100
Year after year in the wandering,

833
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,460
I count the remaining years.

834
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,820
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

835
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,620
even though we end up the destiny,

836
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,060
I never feel regretful.

837
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,980
In such a chaotic world,

838
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,940
I still miss you as ever.

839
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,620
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

840
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,380
With a gentle heart,

841
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,780
I cherish our remaining years.

842
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,580
Even though we have to go through

843
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,740
all the hardships along the journey,

844
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:49,020
you always stay by my side...
