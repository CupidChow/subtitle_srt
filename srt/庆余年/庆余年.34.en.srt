1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 34

16
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,320
I know you are there.

17
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,630
It's been ages. You don't change much.

18
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,000
I've lost my memory

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,190
and don't remember much about you.

20
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,320
Then why do you come to me?

21
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,000
To fight with you.

22
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,190
What's the reason for that?

23
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,800
Xiao En is returning.

24
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,190
If you stay here

25
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,470
and don't go back to Beiqi,

26
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,190
I can give up the fight.

27
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,030
=Ku He, Great Master of Beiqi=
Xiao En shall not return alive.

28
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,880
Then, let's fight!

29
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,320
Stop!

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,160
He is right!

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
If you accept the fight,

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,390
it's hard to survive.

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
=Haitang Duoduo, Saintess of Beiqi=
Almost got him.

34
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,960
He detected you long time back.

35
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,190
Really?

36
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
You were already around me

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,360
when I just arrived

38
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,830
and changed direction three times

39
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,750
while we were talking.

40
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,830
Awesome!

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,240
Master,

42
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,350
I can't beat this guy.

43
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,600
Go to the territory of Nanqing

44
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,670
and kill Xiao En!

45
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't let him return.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,550
Master, you said it too loudly.

47
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,230
He's heard it.

48
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,790
How do I leave?

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
Anyone can leave

50
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,040
except the Great Master.

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,390
Off I go!

52
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,230
Your skin is so fine and smooth.

53
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,070
It's flawless!

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,670
What do you use for face care?

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Haitang!

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,040
I know! I know!

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm leaving right away!

58
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,350
That's fantastic!

59
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,640
Master, beat him!

60
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,110
He probably can't hear me.

61
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,950
Your Excellency, I settled Xiao En well now.

62
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,230
He is locked right in that carriage.

63
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,600
Two guards are watching over him.

64
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,670
How was it with you?

65
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,390
I've said plenty of witty words

66
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,600
which completely erased

67
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,000
his intent to kill me.

68
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,110
Your Excellency, she has a crush on you.

69
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,200
Nonsense!

70
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,510
She was captured by me.

71
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,270
Your Excellency,

72
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,880
she likes you.

73
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,510
See?

74
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,040
Why are you making fun of me as well?

75
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm not!

76
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,000
Anyone can perceive that.

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,670
You see?

78
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,670
You don't understand.

79
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,790
She is a prisoner.

80
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,110
Prisoner also has feelings.

81
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,670
It's such a surprise

82
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,600
to hear someone as decent as you

83
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,920
to say wise words like this.

84
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,350
Anyone will naturally understand human mind
as they see more and more people.

85
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,200
We are kindred spirits.

86
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,070
Human mind might be unpredictable,

87
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,480
but it's most valuable to have feelings.

88
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,320
Enough of that.

89
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,230
You two come with me to the room.

90
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,200
You,

91
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
repeat every word Xiao En told you

92
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,510
in the exactly

93
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,550
the same way.

94
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,790
May I know how old your wife is?

95
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,200
Words like that

96
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,510
completely erased his hostility

97
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,550
against me.

98
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,790
His tone became much softer.

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,110
You are indeed eloquent

100
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,550
and good at psychological tactics.

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,920
It's a requisite skill

102
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,790
to survive in the world.

103
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,110
It's the so-called tactic

104
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,200
to use different words towards different targets...

105
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,320
You've done it wrongly.

106
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,110
What?

107
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,320
I said you've done it wrongly.

108
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,390
Your Excellency,

109
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,880
Wang has been neither humble nor pushy

110
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,920
and put his identity

111
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
to the lowest.

112
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,720
Xiao En must think

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,880
kidnapping him

114
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,070
would not pose any threat to Your Excellency.

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,880
So definitely, he won't do it, right?

116
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,030
If I may ask,

117
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,550
which one of them is wrong?

118
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,710
All of them!

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,550
All of them?

120
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,640
All the words you said

121
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,760
will lead only one consequence.

122
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,080
Xiao En will kill you for sure

123
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,000
in less than a day.

124
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,520
Your Excellency,

125
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,470
this is a tiring march.

126
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,640
Please go to the camp for a rest.

127
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,840
We will proceed with the patrol.

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,550
We'd better not neglect anything at the border of the states.

129
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,470
Beiqi has been overwhelmed by our crackdown.

130
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,030
There won't be anything bad in these days.

131
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,960
Your Excellency,

132
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,590
we found a cavalry ahead.

133
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,910
Hold it!

134
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,670
Put it down.

135
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,110
Wait here in silence.

136
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,960
Director Yan, there is an urgent edict.

137
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,590
Report it back that I'll go in person.

138
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,470
Yes!

139
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,110
What do you want to do?

140
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,200
I've applied poison

141
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,640
to the dishes for you

142
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,200
in the past days.

143
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,320
The taste is good.

144
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,840
But in retrospect,

145
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,670
it seems I'm not paying any respect to you as a senior.

146
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,550
So, you don't want to do it any more

147
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,550
from today onwards?

148
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,710
What are you doing?

149
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,200
Here has been sieged airtightly.

150
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,880
Senior, please cherish your life.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,710
Done!

152
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,670
Is it used to kill Wang Qinian?

153
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes!

154
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,200
Wang Qinian is

155
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
my right hand.

156
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,590
Wang,

157
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,110
I think His Excellency is right.

158
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,710
No, he is not!

159
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,350
Both of his hands

160
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,440
are tied up.

161
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,960
How will he kill me?

162
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,280
With this!

163
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,150
Your Excellency!

164
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,080
If I don't stop him,

165
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,550
you'll die of this

166
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,590
by tomorrow.

167
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
But Your Excellency, I just don't understand

168
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,030
why he has to kill me.

169
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,080
You've read about Xiao En's life,

170
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,710
right?

171
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840
Yes, I have. The Investigator's Office gave me his introduction.

172
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,670
It says he is ruthless and vicious

173
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,960
and full of scheming ideas.

174
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,030
However, I still don't get it.

175
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,110
I already told him

176
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,470
I'm of little importance.

177
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,200
Besides, killing me

178
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
will not set him free.

179
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,470
Then why will he

180
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,550
still want to kill me?

181
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,910
He is a human.

182
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,110
Just think about it from his position.

183
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,960
What emotions would you have

184
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,910
if you were imprisoned for many years

185
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,280
without day light?

186
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,080
Anger!

187
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,400
Grudges!

188
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,520
Right?

189
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,790
All of them!

190
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,670
All these negative emotions

191
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,640
have been suppressed for so many years.

192
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,760
He needs to unleash them.

193
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,670
Judging from his past behaviors on record,

194
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,710
blood can alleviate his anger the best.

195
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,760
So he will kill me

196
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,400
just to unleash his anger?

197
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,710
This journey to the north

198
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,590
is a chance for Xiao En to escape.

199
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,960
Once he kills

200
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,790
anyone important of my side,

201
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,910
he might lose his chance

202
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,640
as I'll retaliate.

203
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,910
So I told him

204
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,760
you're my right hand.

205
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,960
If you are right,

206
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,230
will he seize me

207
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,640
to threaten you?

208
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,470
No!

209
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,590
Xiao En won't take the risk

210
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,000
unless it's someone that has blood tie with me.

211
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,080
Once he loses it,

212
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
he will be killed by numerous arrows.

213
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,520
To survive

214
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,110
is the top priority

215
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,080
to Xiao En at the moment.

216
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:10,960
Yes!

217
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,400
Your Excellency also has poisoned him.

218
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,000
So it doesn't have any risk at all

219
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,790
in this sense.

220
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,960
We'll take the route from Cangzhou to leave the country.

221
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,880
Your Excellency,

222
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,790
do we need to send someone

223
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,080
to explore the way beforehand?

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,110
The reason why His Excellency

225
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,880
reveals it now is because

226
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,150
he doesn't want more people to know.

227
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,790
This journey will be dangerous.

228
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
I have kept it to myself all the time

229
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,000
to avoid interception ahead.

230
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,400
Your Excellency is so careful.

231
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,960
This journey will surely be safe.

232
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,790
Young Master, everyone is ready.

233
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,550
They are finally here.

234
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,440
Get the horses ready. Let's chase them down!

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,590
The gate has been closed.

236
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,670
Hold this!

237
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,350
We'll set out tomorrow then.

238
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,910
Where are the assassins? Let me have a look.

239
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,030
They are outside the gate.

240
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,590
We'll meet tomorrow when we get out.

241
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,230
Why didn't they come in?

242
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,640
The things they bring won't be allowed

243
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,960
through the gate.

244
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,350
Do they bring weapons?

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,710
Not really.

246
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,470
Your Excellency will know once we meet tomorrow.

247
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
=Capital City=

248
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,110
Vegetables!

249
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,150
Come and check it out!

250
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,150
-Come and check it out! -Cheap vegetables!

251
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,880
Cheap vegetables!

252
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,110
-Cheap vegetables! -Fresh vegetables!

253
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,880
Are these the assassins you find for me?

254
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,760
Dad,

255
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,790
I've hired a bunch of killers.

256
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,710
They are the best of their kind.

257
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,910
You must stop that.

258
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,110
I'll follow behind him

259
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,470
and initiate an attack

260
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,550
to take his life

261
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,280
when they get to the wilderness

262
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,520
That's not possible.

263
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,470
Don't do silly things.

264
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,000
Fresh vegetables!

265
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,000
Sweet and tasty!

266
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,320
Are you sure they know how to kill?

267
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,670
They do!

268
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,110
Once bet, no regret!

269
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,350
No! No! No!

270
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,800
Sweet and tasty!

271
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Are they...

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,880
selling vegetables?

273
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,740
They bring those from the countryside.

274
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,190
As they don't have road permit,

275
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,280
they can't get through the gate

276
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,830
and have to sell here.

277
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,070
I want them here to kill...

278
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,710
Kill people!

279
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,280
They'll do that

280
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,640
after selling up these.

281
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,280
Your Excellency, look,

282
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,640
that bag is prepared for you.

283
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,310
Especially prepared for you.

284
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,070
They were watered with our own liquid dung.

285
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,950
Super tasty!

286
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,950
Your Excellency,

287
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,920
we're going beyond our domain of patrol

288
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,800
if we walk further ahead.

289
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,520
I need to kill someone.

290
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,190
Follow me!

291
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,560
Your Excellency is fleeing away?

292
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,950
I'll be back after I kill that guy.

293
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,400
I've got everything settled in the camp.

294
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,040
It's a severe breach of law for frontier
force to go through the border.

295
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,040
If I leave by myself,

296
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,640
all of you will be guilty

297
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,800
and your lives won't be spared.

298
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,760
After I finish the killing and get back to the camp,

299
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,950
I'll ensure your safety.

300
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,070
If you are unwilling to go,

301
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,950
you're free to leave.

302
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,190
Who do Your Excellency want to kill?

303
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,350
Don't ask. Just follow me!

304
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,680
Where to?

305
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Cangzhou!

306
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,040
The person we're going to kill

307
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,680
will go through Cangzhou to Beiqi.

308
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,160
This needle is hollow. The poison is inside.

309
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,430
We have to do this

310
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
for you are an elder senior.

311
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,760
When do you plan to kill me?

312
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,880
Senior, you must be muddled.

313
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,760
I'm escorting you back to Beiqi.

314
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,590
Chen Pingping won't set me free

315
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,110
to the north.

316
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,160
I don't know what the Head is thinking.

317
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,950
I'm only taking care of my own assignment.

318
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,760
You're not bad, young man!

319
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,350
Thank you, Senior Xiao!

320
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,160
Two cultivations a day

321
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,830
without stop.

322
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,110
I didn't have that kind of perseverance

323
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,710
when I was your age.

324
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
A slow sparrow should make an early start.

325
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,920
I have no talent,

326
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
so I have to rely on hard work.

327
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,760
You have good talent

328
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,710
and strong perseverance.

329
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,760
If you can fight against the strong alone,

330
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,160
your potential will be motivated

331
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,040
to an even higher level.

332
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,350
You can ask me

333
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,590
if you still have anything in doubt.

334
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,040
Stop the carriage!

335
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,920
Done!

336
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,920
Stay with him carefully.

337
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,280
Yes!

338
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,310
Do you want to chat about anything?

339
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,280
I can chat with you.

340
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,400
You...

341
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,680
look very tired.

342
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,590
Xiao En has been keeping inducing me all the way,

343
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,430
which is indeed tiring.

344
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,800
So, what do you come to me for?

345
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,230
Nothing.

346
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,560
Do you want me to massage for you?

347
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,520
That's most kind of you.

348
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,920
Turn around!

349
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,280
Gently! Gently!

350
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,040
Why do you heave a big sigh?

351
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,190
It was I who arrested you.

352
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,470
Yes!

353
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
It was I who threatened you in the dungeon.

354
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,830
So logically,

355
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,710
it would be demanding for you not to hate me.

356
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,830
Why do you treat me like this?

357
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,110
I was knocked out by your poison on the pleasure boat.

358
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,280
When I fled from the capital city,

359
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,190
you chased me down in person.

360
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,800
And in the dungeon, you interrogated me.

361
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,680
Maybe it's my destiny

362
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
to be bullied by you.

363
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,230
Even so,

364
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,000
it is you

365
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,160
who saved my life in the end

366
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,470
so that I can get out of the trouble.

367
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,830
I don't know

368
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,880
whether I should hate you or thank you in my heart.

369
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,310
I tossed and turned on bed.

370
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,760
Your shadow gets carved in my heart.

371
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,520
I just couldn't tell.

372
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,310
Why are you still sighing?

373
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,880
Am I really that hateful?

374
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,590
You said all those to me

375
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,280
and wear such a facial expression now.

376
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,470
Aren't you afraid that I will do something to you?

377
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,710
I'm used to your bullying already.

378
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,350
So you won't stop me

379
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,070
if I really want to do anything to you?

380
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,190
Don't you believe me given what has happened before?

381
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,470
OK!

382
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,040
Let me take a look

383
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,430
at what is held in your left hand.

384
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
You've been holding it

385
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,680
ever since I stepped onto the carriage.

386
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,920
That's exceptional love to it.

387
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,590
Are Your Excellency laughing

388
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,710
at my ignorance?

389
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,680
I know you.

390
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,710
Of course, Your Excellency know everything.

391
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,000
Locked up in a deep dungeon

392
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,400
without day light and hope of survival,

393
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
every day you were full of worries

394
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
about what will happen tomorrow.

395
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,230
That's a most difficult time to go through.

396
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,350
Despite that you're on the way

397
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,350
back to Beiqi now,

398
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,230
I am the one who is escorting you.

399
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,000
After all, you took part in

400
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,110
the Niulan Street assassination.

401
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,520
Of course, you'll worry that I might retaliate you

402
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,560
or kill you on the way,

403
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,590
but what can you do

404
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,590
as a weak lady?

405
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,950
You can only ingratiate me

406
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,680
like just now.

407
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,950
You think it will give you

408
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,400
more chances of surviving,

409
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,950
right?

410
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,430
And you are afraid I may give full
play to my animal disposition,

411
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,400
so you hold it tightly

412
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,310
in your hand

413
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,190
because it is your only reliance

414
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,070
at this moment.

415
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,070
But both you and I understand that

416
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,760
you can't stab me with it.

417
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,760
You dare not to.

418
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
You are afraid to hurt me,

419
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,520
because once you do,

420
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,830
you'll have no chance of surviving.

421
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,560
Neither do you dare to spur yourself with it

422
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,560
because you don't want to die.

423
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,760
Right? Am I right?

424
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,640
You can't stab me

425
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,310
or yourself with it.

426
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,470
In this case,

427
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,110
what's the point of keeping it?

428
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,230
Your life is grasped

429
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,190
in other's hands.

430
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,680
I know you feel very helpless.

431
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,950
I also know you feel grueling.

432
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,590
Miss Lili,

433
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,230
this is the fault of the morals of the time.

434
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,520
The fight between two states

435
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,400
leaves a weak lady in such a hardship.

436
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,520
I truly understand you.

437
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,950
Just cry it out.

438
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,160
Just cry!

439
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,230
Don't hold it if you want to cry.

440
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,560
Stop looking! Keep marching.

441
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
She sounds very sad.

442
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,310
What is his name?

443
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,640
Si Lili.

444
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,310
She is also a secret agent from Beiqi.

445
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,800
I mean your master!

446
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,950
You still don't remember

447
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,760
what his name is?

448
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,880
Fan Xian!

449
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,640
Fan Xian!

450
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,040
Now I remember it.

451
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,070
He is bound to be a great enemy for Beiqi.

452
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,280
Just because he can make a woman cry?

453
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,560
It's not easy to take down your vigilance

454
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,920
in the territory of your enemy.

455
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,880
No one will hurt you on the way.

456
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,800
Just calm down. I'm sending you back home.

457
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,590
Actually, my home is not in Beiqi.

458
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,590
My really name is Li Lisi.

459
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,230
Li?

460
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,040
The rumor is true.

461
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,920
I'm descendent of the Nanqing imperial family.

462
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,190
In that year, the Emperor Qing ascended the throne.

463
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,710
Naturally, there were plenty of bloodbaths.

464
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,070
My tribe were almost wiped out.

465
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,760
So I fled to Beiqi with my family.

466
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,640
You came to the capital city for revenge?

467
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,800
I have a younger brother.

468
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,520
He is my only kinsfolk.

469
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,800
Everything I did

470
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,430
was to make sure he lives well.

471
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,710
Beiqi coerces you with your brother?

472
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,280
Forget that.

473
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,190
There is nothing to discuss about that.

474
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,470
Maybe I can help you.

475
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,230
With what?

476
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Find your younger brother

477
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,710
and bring him back to Nanqing.

478
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,470
That's not necessary.

479
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,560
The result is the same.

480
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
You didn't give away my secret

481
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,470
when you were caught

482
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,350
last time.

483
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,040
I owe you one.

484
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,110
So this time,

485
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,880
you can ask me a question.

486
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,040
Whatever it is.

487
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,070
I'll answer it as an exception.

488
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,560
Whatever it is?

489
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,710
I heard you're getting engaged.

490
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,880
Yeah!

491
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,830
After I get back from Beiqi.

492
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,040
Have you met?

493
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,400
Yes!

494
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,000
Do you like each other?

495
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,950
Yes!

496
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,680
Is that you want to ask?

497
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,760
So wonderful!

498
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,230
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

499
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,400
It's OK now.

500
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,920
I've got all the answers I need.

501
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,950
Young Master!

502
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,470
Fan Xian is too far away from us.

503
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,110
Could you just

504
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,880
go a bit faster?

505
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,190
Yes! Yes! Yes!

506
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,190
Young Master,

507
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,640
your horse is dedicated to imperial ceremonies, right?

508
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,640
What?

509
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,710
Horses like this

510
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,230
cannot go far as they are not fed with fine fodder.

511
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,310
That's ridiculous!

512
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,470
This is a supreme horse

513
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,430
which I picked from a thousand others.

514
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,920
It can't have any problems.

515
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,760
Hurry up!

516
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,520
It has relentless diarrhea and won't make it.

517
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
Come back! Come back! Come back!

518
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,350
Come back!

519
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,880
After I catch up with you,

520
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,470
you ditch me.

521
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,950
And I will catch up with you again,

522
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
and you ditch me again.

523
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,830
I really can't catch up now.

524
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,280
I'm about to collapse.

525
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,560
Young Master,

526
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,830
we're climbing mountains now

527
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,400
as a short cut.

528
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,040
We're supposed to catch Fan Xian

529
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,950
at the border.

530
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,040
Short cut?

531
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,230
Good! Fine!

532
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,070
But your speed is really too slow.

533
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,190
Then what to do now?

534
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,520
I... I'm too tired to move.

535
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,470
Steadily! Steadily!

536
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,400
Young Master, take some.

537
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,400
No!

538
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,230
It's too bitter.

539
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,950
Young Master,

540
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,470
you've been used to privileged life.

541
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This is too hard for you.

542
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,430
You might as well give it up.

543
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,390
No!

544
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,150
I must kill Fan Xian.

545
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,390
Alright! As long as you can take it.

546
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,560
Fan Xian is with the mission.

547
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,870
There must be guards.

548
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,120
Do you bring any weapons?

549
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,470
Yes!

550
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,360
We do!

551
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,320
Young Master wants to check out the weapons.

552
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,470
What is this?

553
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,520
Young Master,

554
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,280
this is rolling pin, for rolling doughs.

555
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,120
I've thought about it thoroughly.

556
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,560
Everyone, listen to me!

557
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,560
I've read all the books on art of war and I'm proficient on them.

558
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,670
You shall follow my orders

559
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,190
and take action accordingly.

560
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,430
Kill Fan Xian when he is unprepared.

561
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,670
Sure!

562
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,190
We're close to the border.

563
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,280
I've been doubtful over one thing

564
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,390
and I want to ask you about that.

565
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,600
Tell me about it.

566
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,280
Why were you not killed at the time?

567
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,360
I know a lot of important things.

568
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,800
Interrogated for information. I got that.

569
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,910
Then why

570
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,430
didn't they cut your hands and feet?

571
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
There should be a bottom line

572
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,230
for everything.

573
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,080
If it goes beyond the line that I can tolerate,

574
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,150
I'll suicide.

575
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,000
Before they get

576
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,840
the information they want,

577
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,760
Chen Pingping doesn't want me to die.

578
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,840
That still doesn't make sense.

579
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,120
What?

580
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,560
Your bottom line

581
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,870
perhaps should not be crossed at that time.

582
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,910
But since they are sending you back to Beiqi now,

583
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,710
why didn't they cut your hands and feet

584
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,320
when you left the capital city?

585
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,390
You still have some chance to survive now,

586
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,320
so you won't commit suicide.

587
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,230
Cutting your hands and feet now

588
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,760
will make you less threatening on the way.

589
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,000
That's reasonably

590
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,870
the best for both worlds.

591
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,470
Chen Pingping knows it

592
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,870
better than me.

593
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,430
Why did he become merciful to you

594
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,430
all of a sudden?

595
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,800
That's also the point I don't understand.

596
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,080
Beiqi wants the live Xiao En.

597
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,080
You might as well abrogate his martial arts

598
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,000
rather than giving such a big source

599
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
of disaster to Fan Xian.

600
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,470
You don't need to worry about Fan Xian's safety.

601
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,320
I know

602
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,320
your black knights have been

603
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,470
protecting Fan Xian during the way.

604
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,120
However,

605
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,800
Xiao En is not an easy person.

606
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,390
How can I not worry about it?

607
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,910
Put out the lamp!

608
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,040
I don't care!

609
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,080
Maybe they want me

610
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,470
to deal with you.

611
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,470
They want to take advantage of me

612
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,280
to kill you as a promising young man.

613
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,230
You don't need to instigate like this,

614
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,040
Senior Xiao!

615
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,560
Don't trust Chen Pingping too much.

616
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,120
You'll regret it

617
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,280
sooner or later.

618
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,840
As you ordered,

619
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,360
all the black knights have withdrawn.

620
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,080
Nobody is protecting Fan Xian

621
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,390
as of now.

622
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,520
We got information the other day that

623
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,360
Shangshan Hu traveled south

624
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,280
with his personal guards

625
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,950
and disappeared in the end.

626
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,120
He must have gone to save Xiao En.

627
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,870
Yes!

628
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,040
Then he will run into Fan Xian for sure.

629
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,760
Withdrawing the black knights now

630
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
will leave Fan Xian high and dry

631
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,000
against the Beiqi War God.

632
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,560
Don't you take him as your nephew?

633
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,520
You're jeopardizing his life

634
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,800
by doing so.

635
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,710
Don't let Fei Jie know

636
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,080
about Shangshan Hu.

637
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,360
What are you going to do to Fan Xian?

638
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,840
He is a smart guy.

639
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,760
It took me a lot of time

640
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,870
and arrangements

641
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,800
to win his trust.

642
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:17,710
This day is finally about to come.

643
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,910
Wang,

644
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,840
His Excellency Fan wants to meet you.

645
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,280
Your Excellency,

646
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,040
Gao Da and the swordsmen under him

647
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,840
are very reliable.

648
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,600
You can trust them

649
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,280
whatever you want to do.

650
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,190
My dad said

651
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,630
you are trustworthy.

652
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,390
I need your help with one thing.

653
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,800
At your service, Your Excellency!

654
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,560
I need to take Xiao En away.

655
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,190
What's that for?

656
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,000
The Lady Ye used to travel with Xiao En.

657
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,600
My mom?

658
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,230
She also told me that

659
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,040
she came to this world

660
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,520
because of Xiao En.

661
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,230
I need to ask him for something.

662
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,910
And you're critically important for it.

663
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,430
He is saved by people from Beiqi.

664
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,560
Beiqi is in the wrong.

665
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,670
They won't prevent us from

666
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,670
taking Yan Bingyun back.

667
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,950
Beiqi?

668
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,390
Shangshan Hu is Xiao En's adoptive son.

669
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,870
You know him, right?

670
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,280
Your Excellency, are you in contact with him?

671
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,390
I only want to borrow his name.

672
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,380
In the river of history,

673
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,580
time goes round and round.

674
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,940
Memories about the former and present lives

675
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,820
join each other in an endless way.

676
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,420
In the long drunken Milky Way,

677
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,140
one season follows another in a flash,

678
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,340
and the wild geese are flying south.

679
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,260
I just can't give up

680
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,260
to be with you for my whole life.

681
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,540
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

682
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,340
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

683
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,220
Year after year in the wandering,

684
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,780
I count the remaining years.

685
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,980
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

686
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,540
even though we have ended up the destiny,

687
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,220
I never feel regretful.

688
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,180
In such a chaotic world,

689
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,940
I still miss you as ever.

690
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,580
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

691
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,300
With a gentle heart,

692
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,860
I cherish our remaining years.

693
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,700
Even though we have to go through

694
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,660
all the hardships along the journey,

695
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:17,980
you always stay by my side,

696
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,740
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

697
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,660
Year after year in the wandering,

698
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,020
I count the remaining years.

699
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,380
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

700
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,180
even though we end up the destiny,

701
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,620
I never feel regretful.

702
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,540
In such a chaotic world,

703
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,500
I still miss you as ever.

704
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,180
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

705
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,940
With a gentle heart,

706
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,340
I cherish our remaining years.

707
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,140
Even though we have to go through

708
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,300
all the hardships along the journey,

709
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:58,580
you always stay by my side...
