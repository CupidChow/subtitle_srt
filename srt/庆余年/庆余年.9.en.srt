1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 9

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,830
How did they

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,870
move here?

18
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,830
I was afraid

19
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,590
someone else wants to kill them,

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,270
so I bought the house.

21
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,550
What if

22
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,800
I really wanted to kill them?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,120
What would you do?

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
You must be kidding.

25
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,670
I don't dare to do anything.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
Your lightness skill is amazing!

27
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,630
I'm nobody.

28
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm always at your service.

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,440
You're not Teng Zijing's relative or friend,

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,520
but you even deceived me

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,190
to protect his family.

32
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,270
Wang Qinian.

33
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,240
It's my fault. I'm sorry for my negligence of duty.

34
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,160
You're warm-hearted.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
It's perceptive of you to notice that.

36
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,880
I had duck blood soup

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,910
with vermicelli for dinner.

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,800
It makes me feel warm.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Stop playing the fool.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
Your Excellency. Give me a kick.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
I hope you've vented your spleen.

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,830
You're just a clerk.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,240
It proves the Investigator's Office is full of able persons.

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,080
No.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,600
You're the one who's beautiful in mind

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,830
and clever in appearance.

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,750
It doesn't make sense.

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,670
Sorry.

50
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,080
I'm poor in expression.

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,110
Don't tell anyone

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,470
about Teng Zijing's issue.

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
Teng Zijing?

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,910
Wasn't he killed

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,320
by you?

56
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,030
Your Excellency, did you forget it?

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,030
I'd like to thank you on behalf of him.

58
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,600
Nah. Don't say that.

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,030
What is it?

60
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,360
The house

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,670
cost me 123 taels of silver.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
This is the title deed.

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,750
Your Excellency,

64
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,320
we were destined to meet,

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,750
right?

66
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,550
Can you round the price up

67
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,960
to 130 taels?

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,830
That's too much.

69
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,720
How about 125?

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,630
You have to

71
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,470
round it up, anyway.

72
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,240
I save them.

73
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,440
It's worth it, right?

74
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,880
I don't have money with me.

75
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
Come to my mansion later.

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,830
No way!

77
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,000
I won't give you the title deed

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,270
unless you pay me.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,750
Your Excellency,

80
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,960
Guo Baokun works for the Crown Prince.

81
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
And his father is powerful.

82
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,030
It's okay you hit him,

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
but why did you tell him who you are?

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,190
I'm afraid

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,880
you'll get into trouble.

86
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,720
It's none of his business.

87
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,630
I did it.

88
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I will

89
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,630
accept responsibility for it.

90
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,480
Hey.

91
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
You just came back.

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,270
Do you want to leave your wife and son again?

93
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,600
Be a good father.

94
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,110
You did it for me.

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,760
Stop it.

96
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,880
Make your decision

97
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,350
after you listen to me.

98
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,640
Listen.

99
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,440
Why did I tell Guo Baokun

100
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
it's me

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,040
when I hit him?

102
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,510
Why?

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
I did it on purpose.

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't want to marry Lin Wan'er.

105
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,640
Only by making big trouble

106
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,720
can I break off the marriage contract.

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,350
Then I'll

108
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,880
marry Lady Drumstick.

109
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,390
So,

110
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,350
it has nothing to do with you.

111
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,110
Don't be moved.

112
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Why did you help me?

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
As I said,

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,000
I did it to break off my marriage contract.

115
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,110
Why did you help me?

116
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,440
I want to help my friend. Can't I?

117
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,110
There is a big difference between us.

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,790
Your father is Earl Sinan

119
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,070
and you're the Director-General of the Investigator's Office,

120
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,200
but I'm just an ordinary being.

121
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,880
Do you know there is a stone tablet

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,440
at the gate of the Investigator's Office?

123
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Yes.

124
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,040
It says

125
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,720
men are created equal

126
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,880
and there is neither lowliness nor nobleness.

127
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Nobody believes that.

128
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,440
I do.

129
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,110
But in this case...

130
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,160
All right. Guys,

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,830
so much for this.

132
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,200
I'll get you a false identity tomorrow.

133
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,270
Now,

134
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,550
I have to go back to the brothel.

135
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,790
His Excellency

136
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,640
is really something else.

137
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,920
Thank you for what you did.

138
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,760
You're welcome.

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,670
130 taels of silver.

140
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,510
When I pulled out your hair clasp,

141
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,350
I put a hair on your shoulder

142
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,510
after tying a knot.

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,640
Your pose remains unchanged,

144
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,760
but the hair is gone.

145
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,350
You woke up.

146
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,670
You can keep your breath under control,

147
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,920
but you can't control your heartbeat.

148
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,440
Your pulse is fast. You're nervous.

149
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,670
You even know how to feel the pulse.

150
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,390
It's nothing.

151
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,070
I can be considered a doctor, anyway.

152
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,070
But the hair thing is false.

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
You took the bait easily.

154
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,000
You should've been more careful.

155
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,920
You're versatile!

156
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,440
It usually takes some time

157
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,790
for a person to come around

158
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,510
after being drugged by me,

159
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,790
unless they've been taking such drugs

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,640
so that drug resistance happens.

161
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,110
Drug resistance?

162
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,200
I've never

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,350
heard of this phrase.

164
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
Who on earth are you?

165
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,950
Where did you go at midnight?

166
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,160
How about like this?

167
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,950
I won't ask you about your background.

168
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
I won't tell anyone

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,350
you once went out.

170
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
All I remember is

171
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
one night with you on my bed.

172
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,280
Fan!

173
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,320
Did you have a good time last night?

174
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,790
I almost can't walk now.

175
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,000
I need to catch up on my sleep when I go home.

176
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,590
Go ahead.

177
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,400
See you around.

178
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,000
He wasn't on the boat last night.

179
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,910
I saw him leave,

180
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,110
but I don't know where he went.

181
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,640
He punched a guy.

182
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,710
What?

183
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,440
That's why

184
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,550
I rushed here.

185
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,150
Fan Xian punched Guo Baokun last night.

186
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,670
It's something serious.

187
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,790
So,

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,150
are you here for Fan Xian?

189
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,350
Yes.

190
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,840
Sorry for any inconvenience.

191
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,200
Someone accused him of doing violence.

192
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,550
He's not home.

193
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,150
Madam,

194
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,910
we're ordered by the Magistrate

195
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,030
to do it.

196
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,590
You should go look for him.

197
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,030
If it's okay,

198
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
we'd like to

199
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,030
search your mansion.

200
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,350
It's not okay.

201
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,320
Madam,

202
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,670
we're under orders.

203
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,760
Show them the door!

204
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,280
There are visitors in the early morning.

205
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,080
Fan Xian!

206
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,400
Catch him!

207
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,590
Go away!

208
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,550
I am here!

209
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,760
Get lost.

210
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,550
I am here.

211
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,760
I won't let them hurt you.

212
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,470
What an awe-inspiring general!

213
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,640
It's nothing. Don't mention it.

214
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,590
Let me wipe them out!

215
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,520
-Get lost! -Mr. Fan.

216
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,710
Go!

217
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,550
Second Young Master.

218
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,280
All of you, get lost!

219
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,080
Second Young Master.

220
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,670
Cut the crap.

221
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,960
Quick. Go away.

222
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,550
Go away.

223
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,910
Do you know where you are?

224
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,710
I'm pissed off at the sight of you.

225
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,550
It's the Fan Mansion. Got it?

226
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,640
We're under orders.

227
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,880
What? Under orders?

228
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,790
Do you know who I am?

229
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
I'm Fan Sizhe.

230
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,790
Stop it.

231
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,910
You want to fight back?

232
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,470
You go to catch Fan Xian!

233
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,400
Guards!

234
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,760
Let's see if we'll outnumber you.

235
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Catch all of them!

236
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,520
Enough. Stop it.

237
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,110
I won't make things difficult for you.

238
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,200
Tell me why

239
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
you want to catch Fan Xian.

240
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,080
Madam,

241
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,880
he hit Guo Baokun

242
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,550
last night.

243
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,110
Impossible.

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,670
Fan Xian was at home last night.

245
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,880
He didn't go out.

246
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,910
But the Guo mansion

247
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,200
sent a written complaint this morning

248
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,520
which says clearly

249
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,400
it's Young Master Fan Xian.

250
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you mean I was lying?

251
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,790
Madam,

252
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,470
no matter it's him or not,

253
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,550
we need to take him

254
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,470
to the prefecture

255
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,440
to make things clear.

256
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,030
Who sent the written complaint?

257
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,030
The butler of the Guo mansion.

258
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,470
You want to take away

259
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,840
a Young Master of the Fan family

260
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,590
just because of a butler's complaint?

261
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,110
Let me tell you something.

262
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,470
Fan Xian will

263
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,320
go to the Prefecture of Capital City

264
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,550
only when the plaintiff

265
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,790
goes there.

266
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,550
By then, Fan Xian will

267
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,080
go to confront him.

268
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,910
You can leave.

269
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,790
Madam Liu Ruyu,

270
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,350
it's against the rules.

271
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,150
I'm following the rules of the Fan family.

272
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,150
Go away!

273
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,350
Get lost!

274
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,670
Want to rebel?

275
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,470
Go away! Go away! Go away!

276
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,030
Quick.

277
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,670
Quick.

278
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,550
Go away.

279
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,520
I'll keep hitting if you stay here.

280
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,710
Tell me the truth. Did you hit him?

281
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,550
Yes.

282
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,590
I'll prepare

283
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,550
a large amount of money

284
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,880
to get it fixed.

285
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,030
It's no big deal.

286
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,200
He's seriously injured.

287
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,440
How seriously?

288
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,260
=Guo Youzhi, Nanqing Minister of the Board of Rites=

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,910
Your Excellency,

290
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,710
Young Master is seriously injured.

291
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,400
How can they ask him to go to the prefecture?

292
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,320
It's ridiculous!

293
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,350
His Majesty trusts Fan Jian,

294
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,320
so I can't use force.

295
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,470
Kun'er has to show up

296
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,470
to push Fan Xian to go to the prefecture.

297
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,110
I'll go. (Chinese pronunciation: Wo qu)

298
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,470
Kun'er, what did you say?

299
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,400
I'll go.

300
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,000
Five seven, five seven. (Chinese Pronunciation: Wu qi, wu qi)

301
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,110
My wife. (Chinese pronunciation: Wu qi)

302
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
He must want to

303
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,350
see his wife.

304
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,710
Come on.

305
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,080
I said, I'll go!

306
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,400
He's not married.

307
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,110
He doesn't have a wife.

308
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll go.

309
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,790
You want to go?

310
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,440
Yes.

311
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,910
You're seriously injured.

312
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,200
You'll suffer more pain

313
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,840
if we carry you there.

314
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
Are you sure?

315
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,000
You must hate Fan Xian very much.

316
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,590
Yes.

317
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,350
He's playing with fire.

318
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,960
Come.

319
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,790
It's not good for me

320
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,350
to get involved.

321
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,320
Get the best lawyer in the capital city.

322
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,520
I won't leave this matter

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,550
at that.

324
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,200
Your Excellency,

325
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,110
I worked as a lawyer

326
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,350
before I came to the capital city.

327
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,030
I've never lost a case

328
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,230
over the years.

329
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,550
Let me get it fixed for you.

330
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,880
I have only one requirement.

331
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,150
Let Fan Xian pay the price

332
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,030
with his life!

333
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,030
Kill him!

334
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,030
Is it so serious?

335
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,000
I lost control of myself.

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,030
You'll be in trouble.

337
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,200
His father will put you into prison

338
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,350
to save face.

339
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,910
And he himself works for the Crown Prince,

340
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,200
who couldn't turn a blind eye to it.

341
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,440
You don't look like

342
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,790
an impulsive guy.

343
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,350
It's not been long since you came here.

344
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,000
How could you make such a big trouble?

345
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,280
He must have died

346
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,440
if I were impulsive.

347
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,350
You pack up

348
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,150
and go back to Danzhou.

349
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,030
They could do nothing

350
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,590
if they can't find you.

351
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,640
Why do you help me?

352
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,670
My surname is Liu,

353
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,230
but I'm a member of the Fan family.

354
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,670
Now I believe it's not you

355
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,670
that plotted the assassination in Danzhou.

356
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,640
Cut the crap.

357
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,840
Lose no time.

358
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,640
You have to leave now.

359
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,150
I've had some money prepared

360
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,150
in the backyard.

361
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,230
-You... -Madam.

362
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,550
I have to stay.

363
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,030
To go to the prefecture?

364
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,670
It's okay.

365
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,150
How can I let you do that?

366
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,790
You want to

367
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,030
make it bigger, don't you?

368
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,910
It pissed me off!

369
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,640
What are you doing?

370
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,150
Where is my broom?

371
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,840
Why do you need it?

372
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,350
Mom, those constables are here again.

373
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,910
They said Guo Baokun has been carried to the prefecture.

374
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,400
They asked Fan Xian to confront him.

375
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,790
I'll drive them away.

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,550
Don't bother.

377
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,520
I'll go there.

378
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,680
Step aside!

379
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,920
Excuse me.

380
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,110
Excuse me.

381
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,160
Excuse me, everyone.

382
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,760
I have to go to the prefecture.

383
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,190
Your Highness,

384
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,000
Guo Baokun has supported you

385
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,710
for a long time.

386
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,350
He is seriously injured this time.

387
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,710
You won't look on and do nothing, right?

388
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,920
Everything has to be done according to law.

389
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
Whether I go or not makes no difference.

390
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,160
You're the Crown Prince.

391
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,640
It makes a big difference.

392
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,710
If Fan Xian is declared guilty,

393
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,640
maybe His Majesty

394
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,590
won't let Wan'er marry him.

395
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,680
Then

396
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,760
you can keep

397
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,280
using Neiku to your advantage.

398
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,710
If you don't show up,

399
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,950
you'll let your subordinates down.

400
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,400
Now that you said so,

401
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,830
I'll go there.

402
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,070
=Mei Zhili, Imperial Magistrate of Prefecture of Capital City=

403
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,560
=Mei Zhili, Imperial Magistrate of Prefecture of Capital City=
Tell me your name.

404
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,740
=Mei Zhili, Imperial Magistrate of Prefecture of Capital City=

405
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,160
Your Excellency,

406
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,710
I'm He Zongwei.

407
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,830
I'm the plaintiff attorney.

408
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,830
I'm Fan Xian.

409
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,190
Fan Xian, do you know your sin?

410
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,400
Completely don't know.

411
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,230
Come. Show him

412
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,190
the written complaint.

413
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,470
Why does it say

414
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,190
I hit Mr. Guo Baokun?

415
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,190
Do you have any question?

416
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,680
Can you tell me

417
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,590
where Mr. Guo is?

418
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,310
Mr. Fan, please look here.

419
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,190
I was wondering

420
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,160
what it is.

421
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,880
Is it a human?

422
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,800
Your Excellency,

423
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
he injured Mr. Guo so severely

424
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,760
that he has to be wrapped like this,

425
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,070
but he's still making sarcastic remarks.

426
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,710
I just said it's a human.

427
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,680
Why do you think it's sarcasm?

428
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,400
Do you mean it's not a human?

429
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,880
He's violent and wicked.

430
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,350
Please give him a heavier punishment.

431
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,400
Hold on.

432
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,880
It says

433
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,110
all the servants fainted

434
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,520
after being drugged at that time.

435
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,350
And Guo Baokun was hit

436
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,470
while his head was covered in a bag.

437
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,880
Now that there were no witnesses,

438
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,430
why did you say it's me?

439
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,830
Because he heard your voice.

440
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:10,920
What did I say?

441
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,830
You told him who you are.

442
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,950
Why did I do that?

443
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,760
Villains are often swollen with arrogance

444
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,880
when they do violence.

445
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,400
Now that I told him who I am,

446
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,190
why did I cover his head

447
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,160
in a bag?

448
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,000
Isn't it

449
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,190
inconsistent?

450
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,040
Because you want to use this

451
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,560
as an excuse to clear your name.

452
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,590
If I guess right,

453
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,920
you'll say someone else did it in your name.

454
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,760
Your Excellency,

455
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,760
he just said

456
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,040
it's someone else that did it.

457
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,950
You can make a decision.

458
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,830
Look.

459
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,430
Mr. Guo also agrees.

460
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,310
Now that nobody

461
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,710
saw the assailant...

462
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,310
Your Excellency,

463
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
the assailant recited

464
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,680
a poem when he hit Mr. Guo.

465
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,760
"A thousand miles from home, I'm grieved at autumn's plight."

466
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,880
"I'll now and then for years, alone I'm on this height."

467
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,500
Good lines of verse!

468
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:56,640
=Guo Baokun, the son of Nanqing Minister of the Board of Rites=
Good lines of verse!

469
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:56,830
=Guo Baokun, the son of Nanqing Minister of the Board of Rites=

470
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,540
=Guo Baokun, the son of Nanqing Minister of the Board of Rites=
Your Excellency,

471
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:57,590
Your Excellency,

472
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,800
a poetry gathering was held yesterday

473
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,920
in Prince Jing's mansion,

474
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,560
where Fan Xian wrote a poem.

475
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,070
The two lines of verse are part of it.

476
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,350
The assailant recited it

477
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
when he hit Mr. Guo.

478
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,110
It proves

479
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,230
Fan Xian is the assailant.

480
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,350
It makes sense.

481
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,430
Your Excellency,

482
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,710
do I look stupid?

483
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,680
I don't think so. You're skilled in debate.

484
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,880
Then why did I

485
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
recite my poem

486
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,880
while hitting him?

487
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,470
Obviously,

488
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,560
someone wants to make me a scapegoat.

489
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,640
It was written yesterday.

490
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,800
Who else knew it?

491
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,070
There were lots of people at the poetry gathering.

492
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,350
They all heard me recite it.

493
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,430
Fan Xian, can you tell me

494
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,160
where you were last night?

495
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,040
To be honest,

496
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,070
I went to a brothel

497
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,710
last night.

498
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,800
Can anyone give witness?

499
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,000
Both Li Hongcheng, Prince Jing's son,

500
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
and Si Lili from Joy Tsin House

501
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,880
can do that.

502
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,040
Your Excellency, please summon them.

503
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
Why did you get

504
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,110
Prince Jing's son involved?

505
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,470
The assailant is savage and cruel.

506
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,040
Mr. Guo Youzhi also takes it seriously.

507
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,280
Please do your utmost.

508
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,160
Did you hear that?

509
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,040
Take the witnesses here.

510
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,880
It's beautiful.

511
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,680
Where is it made?

512
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,470
Really?

513
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,950
Look at the patterns.

514
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,470
It's bright-colored.

515
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,560
-I also want to... -Sister.

516
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,880
Who is he?

517
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,310
Excuse me.

518
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,760
Who is he? Why did he break in?

519
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,800
I think he's her younger brother.

520
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,470
Come over.

521
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,400
Sister, Fan Xian has gone to the prefecture.

522
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,640
You don't know that, right?

523
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,520
I did.

524
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,470
Aren't you worried about it?

525
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,350
You've been getting well

526
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,350
along with him.

527
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,640
I didn't expect to see you get worried.

528
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,920
My bookstore totally relies on him.

529
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,950
Of course I'm worried.

530
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,070
But it's no use.

531
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,640
What should we do?

532
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,470
To get him out of trouble.

533
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,070
But you're chatting

534
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,110
with them over tea.

535
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,350
Can you get him out by doing that?

536
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,280
Follow me.

537
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,760
Their families or relatives

538
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,800
are senior officials.

539
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,560
They're all fascinated by "Red Mansions".

540
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,640
I told them

541
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,760
it's Fan Xian that wrote it.

542
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,110
Sister,

543
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,590
it's urgent.

544
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,230
What's the point of mentioning the book?

545
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,680
Mei Zhili, the Imperial Magistrate,

546
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,160
is responsible for the case.

547
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,400
His daughter is also here.

548
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,920
She promised me

549
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,680
she'd plead with her dad.

550
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,800
It may not work in a short time,

551
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,920
but it'll make a difference

552
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,640
if she makes a scene

553
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
or even threatens to commit suicide.

554
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,920
Then Mei Zhili is bound to give in.

555
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,880
But,

556
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,710
are you sure

557
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
she'll do as you say?

558
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,470
I'll try my best to persuade her.

559
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,560
You also have a task.

560
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,710
I'm also a little worried.

561
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,070
If the result comes out today,

562
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,190
it'll be too late to do all this.

563
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,230
Yeah.

564
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,470
What to do now?

565
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,680
Go to the Prefecture of Capital City

566
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,400
and keep waiting outside.

567
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,950
Once the result is against Fan Xian,

568
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,280
you have to rush in to save him.

569
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,950
Okay.

570
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,520
Sister,

571
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,160
you asked me

572
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,310
to rush in alone

573
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,070
to save him?

574
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,230
Don't worry. I've made preparations.

575
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,710
Ruoruo, where are you going?

576
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,680
Wait for me for a while.

577
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,470
I'll be back soon.

578
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,520
Sister,

579
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,400
what is it?

580
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,040
With your bare hands,

581
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,230
you couldn't do anything.

582
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,350
It...

583
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,760
It's suitable for you.

584
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,310
Okay.

585
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,950
Once the result is against Fan Xian,

586
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,920
I'll rush in and kill them with it.

587
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,190
It's as sure as fate.

588
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,760
Mr. Fan and I stayed at Joy Tsin House last night.

589
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,000
We had a good talk while drinking.

590
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,520
Your Highness,

591
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,680
can you tell me

592
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,830
if you were with Fan Xian at midnight?

593
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,160
At that time,

594
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,760
Mr. Fan and Miss Si

595
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,830
went to the room.

596
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,070
Thank you, Your Highness.

597
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,830
Miss Si Lili.

598
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,920
Here I am.

599
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,000
Was Fan Xian in your room last night?

600
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,880
Yes.

601
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,800
Did he leave at midnight?

602
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,640
Night hours are extremely precious.

603
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,070
Mr. Fan couldn't be considered a man

604
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,110
if he had left, right?

605
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,350
Miss Si,

606
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,710
you have to tell the truth.

607
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,560
Mr. Fan was in my room

608
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,000
last night.

609
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,230
I don't dare to hide the truth.

610
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,040
Now that they're here to give witness,

611
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,230
it seems

612
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,160
it's someone else

613
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,520
that attacked Mr. Guo.

614
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,760
In this case,

615
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,710
Mr. Fan

616
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,520
has spared himself from suspicion.

617
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,470
I think I can close...

618
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,400
Your Excellency!

619
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,280
What's the matter?

620
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,590
Here arrives the Crown Prince!

621
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,070
Mr. Guo, Fan Xian is dead meat.

622
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,950
What are you doing?

623
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,000
Slant it a little.

624
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,680
One in the front and the other behind.

625
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,110
Hurry up.

626
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
Hold it up.

627
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,760
Your servant kowtows upon seeing Your Highness.

628
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,880
We're a family.

629
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,800
Rise.

630
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

631
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,430
Mr. Mei.

632
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,190
Rise.

633
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,950
Thank you, Your Highness.

634
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,640
Why are you here?

635
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,470
To watch you try the case.

636
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,400
It makes me terrified.

637
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,470
It...

638
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,920
Your Highness, please take a seat there.

639
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,400
Take a seat.

640
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,110
Sit.

641
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,470
I don't dare to.

642
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,430
Mei Zhili.

643
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,000
Here.

644
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,310
You're the Imperial Magistrate.

645
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,920
Don't forget it.

646
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,040
Yes, Your Highness.

647
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
All rise.

648
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,520
I mean them, not you.

649
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,680
Continue with your work. Don't mind me.

650
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,560
Yes, Your Highness.

651
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,110
Your Highness,

652
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,430
the trial is finished.

653
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Finished?

654
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,160
Mr. Mei is going to close it.

655
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,920
I'm spared from suspicion.

656
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,760
There are witnesses.

657
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,230
Who are they?

658
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,880
Prince Jing's son and Si Lili.

659
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,760
Hongcheng is a member of the royal family.

660
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
I believe what he said.

661
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,310
As for the woman,

662
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,310
who is she?

663
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,680
Your Highness,

664
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,830
she's a courtesan from Joy Tsin House.

665
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,880
Mei Zhili.

666
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,560
Here.

667
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,590
Here.

668
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,470
Who will lose face

669
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,190
when an Imperial Complier is hit?

670
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,880
It's the royal family!

671
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,040
Got it.

672
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,920
She's of humble origin.

673
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,280
How can you accept what she said

674
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,000
as evidence?

675
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,640
In my opinion,

676
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,160
it has to be investigated strictly.

677
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,040
What do you think?

678
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,280
Your Highness, you're right.

679
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,230
Absolutely.

680
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Si Lili,

681
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,350
Your testimony is confusing.

682
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,070
Guards!

683
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,950
Here.

684
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,880
Get instruments of torture.

685
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,590
Master, why are you back so late?

686
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,950
Fan Xian is still at the Prefecture of Capital City.

687
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,920
I knew.

688
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,470
Then why don't you go there?

689
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,590
Are you worried about him?

690
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,680
If he's declared guilty,

691
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,520
the Fan family will lose face.

692
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,160
He's at the Prefecture of Capital City.

693
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,110
As Assistant Minister of Revenue,

694
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,070
how can I go there?

695
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,880
So you'll turn a blind eye to it?

696
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,560
Of course not.

697
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,230
The situation is unclear.

698
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,400
We have to wait patiently.

699
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,280
It's worrying.

700
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,520
I just got news

701
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,430
that the Crown Prince has gone there.

702
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,520
Guo Baokun works for him.

703
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,590
He must be there to pressure Mei Zhili

704
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,760
to declare Fan Xian guilty.

705
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,470
I knew.

706
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,680
Don't panic.

707
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,710
Besides the Crown Prince,

708
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,350
someone else has also gone there.

709
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,560
But who can stand up to the Crown Prince

710
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,470
as an equal?

711
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,680
Is it...

712
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,110
Fan Xian is closely connected with Neiku.

713
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,830
He's been in the teeth of storms

714
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,830
since he came to the capital city.

715
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,470
His fate

716
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,400
depends on what he can do.

717
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
What if the result is bad?

718
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,470
In this case,

719
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,230
I'll help him survive, anyway.

720
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,350
How?

721
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,680
You're just Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

722
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,560
Do you mean you have someone else behind you?

723
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,470
Actually, I've been curious

724
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,430
why Fan Xian was chosen

725
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,040
to take over Neiku.

726
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,830
What secrets are lurking

727
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,520
behind all this?

728
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,640
Well.

729
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,800
The less you know about it, the better it'll be.

730
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,680
Let's wait for the result.

731
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,560
Get started!

732
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,110
Hold on.

733
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,400
Mr. Fan,

734
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,160
you don't have the right

735
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,310
to give orders at the prefecture, right?

736
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,400
She doesn't need to suffer

737
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,520
if you admit.

738
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,230
Okay.

739
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,310
Will you admit your guilt under torture?

740
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,640
Your servant kowtows upon seeing Your Highness.

741
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,830
All rise.

742
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,760
The Crown Prince is here.

743
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,470
How can you kowtow to me?

744
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,520
Your servant kowtows upon seeing Your Highness.

745
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,080
Chengze.

746
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,120
I've told you numerous times.

747
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,080
We're brothers. You don't have to do that.

748
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,360
You're the Crown Prince.

749
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,710
I have to show my respect.

750
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,910
Why are you here?

751
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,430
To see how influential you're.

752
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,470
With you sitting here,

753
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,320
the Imperial Magistrate

754
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,470
has to do as you say.

755
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,470
It's admirable.

756
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,040
He's the decision maker. I'm just an onlooker.

757
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,080
Really?

758
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,870
Yes.

759
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,800
You were going to close the case,

760
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,600
but why did you start to use torture suddenly?

761
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,560
It...

762
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,710
Go ahead.

763
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,670
Your Highness,

764
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,520
it's my decision.

765
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,430
It has nothing to do with the Crown Prince.

766
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,520
Mr. Mei, please do as you like.

767
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,630
I'm also an onlooker.

768
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,600
So...

769
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,150
Your Highness, sit down please.

770
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,230
Get started.

771
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,230
Don't bother.

772
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,630
Why?

773
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,360
Mr. Fan, do you have anything to say?

774
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,040
Thank you for showing mercy to me.

775
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,150
I'm just a weak woman.

776
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,190
I'm afraid I can't repay your kindness.

777
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,470
If you plead guilty now,

778
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,470
it means I was lying.

779
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,430
I did it for my own sake.

780
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,840
Guards, catch her.

781
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,230
Get started.

782
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,800
Let me repeat it. Si Lili,

783
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,230
did Fan Xian leave the boat last night?

784
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,600
He slept with me.

785
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,800
He didn't leave.

786
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
You're still lying.

787
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,190
Harder!

788
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,950
Mr. Mei,

789
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,630
she's a witness,

790
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,560
but not a suspect.

791
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,040
She just needs to answer your questions.

792
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,710
Why do you keep torturing her?

793
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,520
You're right, Your Highness.

794
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,120
Enough. If it goes on like this,

795
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,760
people will say she admits a confession by tortures.

796
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,630
In this case,

797
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,670
Guo Baokun

798
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,040
really got Fan Xian wrong.

799
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,040
Chengze, no hurry.

800
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,560
Don't jump to a conclusion.

801
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,120
Take him here.

802
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,280
Who is he?

803
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,600
Guo Baokun said that

804
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,150
the assailant kept asking him

805
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,190
about Teng Zijing's family.

806
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,230
As far as I know,

807
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,560
Teng Zijing worked for the Investigator's Office.

808
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,150
He was killed after the assassination in Danzhou,

809
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,670
according to Fan Xian.

810
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,870
So, I'm curious

811
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,600
who wants to find

812
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,910
his family

813
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,280
after his death.

814
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,150
It's more interesting upon further investigation.

815
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,430
It turns out Teng Zijing's family

816
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,360
has moved to somewhere outside the city.

817
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,600
I sent guys to look for them

818
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,390
and this guy was found.

819
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,870
Chengze,

820
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,760
guess who he is.

821
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,840
He's Teng Zijing

822
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,950
who was supposed to be dead.

823
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,120
Interesting, right?

824
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,600
In this case,

825
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,470
we've got to the bottom of it.

826
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,760
He's the assailant!

827
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,870
But Fan Xian reported that

828
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,870
Teng Zijing

829
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,910
was killed.

830
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,670
Maybe he was fooled

831
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,600
by this guy.

832
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,150
As far as I know,

833
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,800
this guy has been staying with Fan Xian

834
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,950
since he came to the capital city.

835
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,120
He also went to the poetry gathering, right?

836
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,520
I did see him.

837
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,870
He's Fan Xian's bodyguard?

838
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,710
Yes.

839
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,190
It's more interesting.

840
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,560
The Investigator's Office serves His Majesty.

841
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,630
Fan Xian

842
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,190
even reported fake news

843
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,230
and hired a former employee

844
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,710
of the Investigator's Office.

845
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,630
I won't talk about the criminal law today,

846
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,910
but by doing that,

847
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,670
Fan Xian,

848
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,080
you've deceived His Majesty.

849
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,430
I threatened Fan Xian with a knife

850
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,710
so that he had to do that.

851
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,560
If it was true,

852
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
why didn't he escape

853
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,910
or turn to help after coming to the capital?

854
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,040
He didn't dare

855
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,470
to risk his life.

856
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,600
As far as I know,

857
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,000
Chengze, you also went to the poetry gathering, right?

858
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,280
And you met Fan Xian in the backyard.

859
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,600
Is it true?

860
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,560
Yes.

861
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,190
Fan Xian, you met Chengze alone.

862
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,630
If you were under threat,

863
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,360
why didn't you turn to him?

864
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,000
So,

865
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,230
I'd be declared guilty

866
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,040
no matter whether I hit Guo Baokun or not.

867
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,470
Considering you're a great poet,

868
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,710
I'll spare your life.

869
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,630
But I can't marry Lin Wan'er, right?

870
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,520
I'm tired.

871
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,280
Chengze, do you have anything else to say?

872
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,910
Put him to torture!

873
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,280
I'd like to see

874
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,470
why Teng Zijing pretended to be killed

875
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,950
and what on earth

876
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,080
he aimed to do.

877
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,950
Guards. Put him to torture!

878
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,430
Hold on.

879
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,150
Your Highness.

880
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,520
Eunuch Hou?

881
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,670
I'm here with His Majesty's oral instructions.

882
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,520
"It's the Investigator's Office that

883
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,840
asked Teng Zijing to pretend to be killed.

884
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,150
I knew that,

885
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,360
so it's not an offense.

886
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,670
It's the Imperial Magistrate's duty to try a case.

887
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,870
The members of the royal family should go back

888
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,320
and mind your own business."

889
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,560
Your subject obeys.

890
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,470
Your Highness.

891
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,710
May I

892
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,190
take the liberty

893
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,870
to ask you a question?

894
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,940
In the river of history,

895
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,140
time goes round and round.

896
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Memories about the former and present lives

897
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,380
join each other in an endless way.

898
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,980
In the long drunken Milky Way,

899
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,700
one season follows another in a flash,

900
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,900
and the wild geese are flying south.

901
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,820
I just can't give up

902
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,820
to be with you for my whole life.

903
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,100
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

904
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

905
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,780
Year after year in the wandering,

906
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,340
I count the remaining years.

907
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,540
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

908
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,100
even though we have ended up the destiny,

909
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,780
I never feel regretful.

910
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,740
In such a chaotic world,

911
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,500
I still miss you as ever.

912
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,140
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

913
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,860
With a gentle heart,

914
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,420
I cherish our remaining years.

915
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,260
Even though we have to go through

916
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,220
all the hardships along the journey,

917
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:10,540
you always stay by my side,

918
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,300
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

919
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,220
Year after year in the wandering,

920
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,580
I count the remaining years.

921
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,940
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

922
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,740
even though we end up the destiny,

923
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,180
I never feel regretful.

924
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,100
In such a chaotic world,

925
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,060
I still miss you as ever.

926
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,740
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

927
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,500
With a gentle heart,

928
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,900
I cherish our remaining years.

929
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,700
Even though we have to go through

930
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,860
all the hardships along the journey,

931
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:51,140
you always stay by my side...
