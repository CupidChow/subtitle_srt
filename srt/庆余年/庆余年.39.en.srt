1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 39

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,510
Even if you're telling the truth,

17
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,760
tell me

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
how you'll get out of here.

19
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,190
Shen Zhong wouldn't

20
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,310
let me go easily.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,800
I have a subordinate called Wang Qinian.

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,800
Wang Qinian?

23
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,270
The clerk of the First Division?

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,230
He's already

25
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,310
chosen to work for me.

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,630
Before I came here,

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,870
I asked him to seek help.

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,590
It's more ridiculous.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,440
Here is Beiqi.

30
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,040
Who can you turn to?

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
Who can match the Embroidered Uniform Guards?

32
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,390
I finally see

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,030
why you're

34
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,910
severely tortured.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Mr. Yan,

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,470
nobody would like you

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,670
because of your character.

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,320
Be gentle.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,520
Sorry.

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,080
I forgot you're injured.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,320
Besides,

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
I took back what I said.

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,470
Someone does like you.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,030
I've told you.

45
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,320
I got close to you

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
just to take advantage of you

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,880
and find out more military information.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,470
I've never been into you.

49
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,470
Don't talk too much.

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,080
You're still weak.

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,880
I've been lying to you.

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,110
I know.

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,440
I tried to hate you,

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,600
but I still don't have the heart

55
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,440
to see you be tortured like this.

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,670
Stupid woman.

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,160
I'll get you a cup of water.

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
She's not stupid.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,750
She just loves you too much.

60
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,270
Your Excellency.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,720
Are they inside?

62
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,320
Yes. They're surrounded.

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,520
Why don't you go in?

64
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,110
Because Lady Shen is inside.

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,720
There is no hot water here.

66
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,240
Make do with it.

67
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,230
Your brother and I

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,270
will be enemies forever.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
You're helping me get out,

70
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,440
but I'm not sure what'll happen in the future.

71
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,670
If you kill my brother someday,

72
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,110
just kill me too.

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,390
Lady Shen cares about you so much.

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,350
Why are you iron-hearted and ruthless?

75
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,270
And, guys,

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
can you continue talking

77
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,720
after we get back to the mission?

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
There is hot water in my place.

79
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,000
Catch me.

80
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,480
Brother,

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,670
they said they wouldn't spare my life

82
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,790
unless they escape.

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,510
You're muddle-headed.

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,070
They are secret agents of the enemy.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,640
I... I was kidnapped.

86
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,110
I'm not an idiot!

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,950
Your Excellency Fan.

88
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,320
Well done.

89
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,320
You came in alone.

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
Aren't you afraid

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,390
I'd also kidnap you?

92
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,390
I just gave them an order.

93
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,550
They have to shoot arrows

94
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,550
at all of us

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,390
if you threaten me.

96
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,230
Brother!

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,440
Your Excellency Shen, you don't have to do that.

98
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,320
You have to hand over Yan Bingyun

99
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,270
to us sooner or later.

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
Now that I found him,

101
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,110
it's better to let me take him back.

102
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,110
No problem.

103
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,550
As long as he gives me

104
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,320
the list of spies in Shangjing,

105
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,720
he'll be set free immediately.

106
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,270
How about telling him about it?

107
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,550
Okay.

108
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,790
All the ministers and assistant ministers

109
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,950
of the six ministries of Beiqi

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,070
are secret agents of Nanqing.

111
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,830
If you kill them,

112
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,920
all will be at peace

113
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,350
and there'll be no spies here.

114
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,270
See?

115
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,110
Did you hear what he said?

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
I was kidnapped.

117
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,000
Your Excellency Fan, you're free to go.

118
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,320
He has to go with me.

119
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,070
No. Not now.

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm not asking for your permission.

121
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,000
Then both of you stay.

122
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,880
Guards!

123
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,600
Your Excellency Shen, if you kill me,

124
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,550
aren't you afraid the two countries will go to war again?

125
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,600
Nobody knows you're here.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,830
Your Excellency Fan disappeared suddenly.

127
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,670
We tried our best to look for you,

128
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,920
only to find your body.

129
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,880
I feel deeply grieved.

130
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,040
I'm bound to find the murderer

131
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,950
to avenge your death.

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,600
Kidnap me.

133
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,880
Kill him!

134
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
Your Excellency!

135
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,600
Guys, hold on.

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
I've got a helper.

137
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
How did you get a helper?

138
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,910
I get well along with people.

139
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,910
Saintess, why are you here?

140
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,710
Now that they found him,

141
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,550
the Embroidered Uniform Guards

142
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,550
lost this round.

143
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,030
Save face and let them go.

144
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,080
It's our own business.

145
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,200
Please stay out of it.

146
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,670
These are not my words.

147
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,710
His Majesty asked you to do that.

148
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,790
I only take orders from the Empress Dowager.

149
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
She also said so.

150
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Shall I wait here

151
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,000
so that you can go to the imperial palace to confirm it?

152
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,350
Let them go.

153
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Got it.

154
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

155
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,520
The Saintess of Beiqi is your helper.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,150
Do you think I'd buy your story?

157
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
Come on.

158
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,280
It's really weird.

159
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,710
Have a good rest.

160
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,550
Don't think too much.

161
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,550
Your Excellency,

162
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,790
I went to Miss Haitang

163
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,590
as you said.

164
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,440
As expected,

165
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,840
you really took him back.

166
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,790
Wang Qinian. It's really you.

167
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,670
Mr. Yan,

168
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,200
I haven't seen you for a long time.

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,910
Nanqing won a landslide victory.

170
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,230
You've made great contributions.

171
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,030
Even you gave in to Beiqi?

172
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
What does he mean?

173
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,230
Ignore him.

174
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,030
What's most incredible

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
about this

176
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,280
is the Saintess of Beiqi

177
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,710
helped us out.

178
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,590
I can understand why you're confused.

179
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,550
Actually, the Saintess

180
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,230
didn't aim to help us,

181
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,200
but to help His Excellency Fan.

182
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,320
They work for different countries,

183
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,440
but the two of them have feelings for each other.

184
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,910
Once a woman falls in love,

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,790
she'll do something beyond comprehension.

186
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,760
Do you think I can't hear you

187
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,640
because you lower down your voice?

188
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,110
How could they fall in love?

189
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,520
I have to

190
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,440
start the story

191
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,640
from his aphrodisiac.

192
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,230
Speaking of...

193
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,790
I can hear you.

194
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,470
Miss Duoduo,

195
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,960
trust me.

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,960
From today on,

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,910
I'll keep my mouth shut

198
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,520
and never spill the beans.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,230
You got it wrong.

200
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,760
Miss Duoduo,

201
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,960
I see. I see.

202
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
It generated because of the medication,
but it's restrained because of love.

203
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,670
Actually,

204
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,760
it's a beautiful love story.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,150
What a martial arts master!

206
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,200
It's not easy for His Excellency.

207
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,200
How can you do this?

208
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
What's wrong with the guy? Shame on him.

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,230
He ran away after harassing girls.

210
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
Aphrodisiac?

211
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,910
It's a misunderstanding.

212
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,400
We'll go to the back door.

213
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,910
Wang.

214
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,880
Gao.

215
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,710
You're still fighting.

216
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,350
There are too many challengers in a queue.

217
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,960
I've enjoyed myself fighting these days.

218
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,080
Tell His Excellency

219
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I've lost to nobody.

220
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,470
The Saintess drove the cart.

221
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,790
Who's inside?

222
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,110
Come over.

223
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,910
It's His Excellency Fan and Mr. Yan

224
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,960
that are sitting inside.

225
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,640
Is he saved?

226
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Yes, thanks to Miss Haitang.

227
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,840
Really?

228
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,710
As for the relationship

229
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,280
between His Excellency and Miss Haitang,

230
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,280
keep it a secret.

231
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,110
Don't tell anyone about it.

232
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,230
Wang,

233
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,790
please get one more challenger in for me.

234
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,080
He's saved.

235
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,080
-Mr. Yan. -Mr. Yan.

236
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,280
Mr. Yan.

237
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,280
That must be hard. You must've suffered a lot.

238
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,280
Yeah.

239
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,710
That's enough.

240
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,320
He's injured.

241
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,470
Take him to my room and let him have a good rest.

242
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,400
You can talk to him later.

243
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,590
Go.

244
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,110
Okay. Support Mr. Yan.

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,760
Gao!

246
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,760
Be careful.

247
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,840
Mr. Yan,

248
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,640
did they cruelly torture you?

249
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,910
Have a good rest now that you're back.

250
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,840
Mind your step.

251
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,960
Thank you, Saintess.

252
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,320
Why did you let Wang Qinian come to me?

253
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,280
To save us.

254
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,760
What if I hadn't shown up?

255
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,000
But you did.

256
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,640
It's because His Majesty asked me to do that.

257
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,200
Please convey my thanks to him.

258
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,550
He'll see you in a few days.

259
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,110
Gao, spare no effort.

260
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,350
For what?

261
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,230
To talk about killing Shen Zhong.

262
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,840
Why?

263
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,790
Without his verbal instructions,

264
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,550
you couldn't have saved Yan Bingyun.

265
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,910
But I have

266
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,200
taken him back.

267
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,760
I want nothing nowadays.

268
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,320
Why do I have to kill Shen Zhong?

269
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,350
Do you always

270
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,350
act shamelessly?

271
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,320
Anyway, I have to thank you.

272
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,550
I can't believe you said that.

273
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,840
It turns out you'd also lose your temper from embarrassment.

274
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,590
What are you talking about?

275
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,350
I'll teach Wang Qinian a lesson

276
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,350
and stop him talking nonsense again.

277
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,520
You're birds of a feather.

278
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,440
We're not.

279
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,150
I can't quite follow

280
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,910
Wang Qinian's brain circuits.

281
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,230
What's "brain circuits"?

282
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,280
It means mind and thoughts.

283
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,950
I'm leaving. Just wait to be called in.

284
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,950
Oh.

285
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,560
My senior fellow apprentice is coming here in a few days.

286
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,590
You'd better not wander around.

287
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,230
Is he dangerous?

288
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,560
Besides my master,

289
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,350
he's the number one martial arts master in Beiqi.

290
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,470
He's called Langtao.

291
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,560
Sugar-coated haws!

292
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,070
Knickknacks!

293
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,920
=Langtao, first apprentice of Great Master Ku He=

294
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,300
=Langtao, first apprentice of Great Master Ku He=
What's wrong with him?

295
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,560
What's wrong with him?

296
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,760
Blood!

297
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
He's bleeding.

298
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,760
He's killed.

299
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,190
Most of the officials here

300
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,110
are from Court of State Ceremonials.

301
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,470
We're a mission.

302
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,070
Of course it's mainly composed
of staff of Court of State Ceremonials.

303
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,040
Are you really the envoy?

304
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,230
Definitely.

305
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,160
Unbelievable. Beiqi even agreed to set me free.

306
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,920
We exchanged someone else for you through negotiations.

307
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,710
Who?

308
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,430
Xiao En.

309
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,190
You exchanged Xiao En for me?

310
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,710
Idiot!

311
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,070
Is Xiao En

312
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,160
still under control?

313
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,920
We exchanged him for you,

314
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,310
so we handed him over to Shen Zhong.

315
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
Did you get the secret

316
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,310
out of him?

317
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,800
No.

318
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,950
Do you know who Xiao En is?

319
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,880
Yeah.

320
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,680
Then why did you let him come back to Beiqi?

321
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,230
To get you back.

322
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,350
I just told you.

323
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,040
Just let me die.

324
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,070
How can you lay by trouble for the future

325
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,110
because of me?

326
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,160
Don't you want to live?

327
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,070
Since I joined the Investigator's Office,

328
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,430
I've known

329
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,040
I may die anytime for the national interest.

330
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,830
Which idiot made the decision?

331
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,070
His Majesty and Head Chen.

332
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,590
His Majesty also said

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,280
Xiao En is old but you're young,

334
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,880
so it's a good deal

335
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,470
for Nanqing.

336
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Sit here.

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,160
But His Majesty did ask me to

338
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,920
kill Xiao En on the way.

339
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,710
In this case,

340
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,760
why didn't you do it?

341
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,070
He's under control of Shen Zhong.

342
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,000
How can I do it?

343
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,920
The Investigator's Office will do anything it's ordered to

344
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,880
no matter how difficult it is.

345
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,430
Listen to me.

346
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,230
Shen Zhong is quite cruel

347
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,350
to Xiao En.

348
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,400
They're not in the same camp.

349
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Xiao En

350
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,880
couldn't have a chance to make trouble.

351
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,040
Now that His Majesty asked us to kill him,

352
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,350
we have to do it.

353
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,190
Here is Shangjing.

354
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,920
It's already risky to save you.

355
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,760
Do you want to disobey His Majesty's order?

356
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,400
I have no choice. I just can't do it.

357
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
How about you doing it?

358
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,520
Where are you going? What do you want to do?

359
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,950
I'm going to kill Xiao En.

360
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,280
Are you crazy?

361
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
How can you do it like this?

362
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,230
It doesn't matter if I can do it.

363
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,110
Someone has to carry out the orders.

364
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,590
But if you go out like this,

365
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,830
you'll die before you find Xiao En.

366
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,400
I am already dead

367
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,640
when I was arrested.

368
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,070
Why are you taking it so lightly?

369
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,760
Have you thought about your parents?

370
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,590
It's all for the sake of Nanqing.

371
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,230
For the sake of Nanqing, right?

372
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,680
Do you know what a high price

373
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,800
Nanqing paid to save you?

374
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,110
How dare you

375
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,280
try to let yourself

376
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,470
be killed here?

377
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,800
His Majesty ordered you

378
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,160
to go back to Nanqing safe and sound.

379
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,430
If you die like that,

380
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,710
both of us will be betrayers of Nanqing.

381
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,640
No. You'll be a betrayer.

382
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,710
You'll be a betrayer!

383
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,830
It's for the sake of Nanqing.

384
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,350
For the sake of Nanqing.

385
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,470
Even if it's for the sake of Nanqing,

386
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,000
we shouldn't

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,920
take our lives lightly.

388
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,000
You can do something for Nanqing in another way.

389
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,350
How about like this?

390
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,560
I promise you.

391
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,800
I'd find a chance

392
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,070
to kill Xiao En.

393
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,280
Besides,

394
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,520
Shen Zhong is

395
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,830
Commander-in-chief of the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

396
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,430
Let's also kill him

397
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,400
and make Beiqi fall into a state of chaos.

398
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
What do you think?

399
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,310
How will you kill Shen Zhong?

400
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,350
To cooperate with others.

401
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,350
Will Haitang join hands with you to kill their official

402
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,430
because she loves you?

403
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,640
Come on.

404
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm going to join hands with the little emperor.

405
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,350
Does the emperor of Beiqi

406
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,880
plan to root out the Empress Dowager's
underlings and seize power?

407
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,830
You prove yourself to be an experienced spy.

408
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,070
You're thinking quickly.

409
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,040
Tell me everything that's happened

410
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,710
since you came here.

411
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,160
No problem.

412
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,070
Take off your clothes and lie down.

413
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,230
I'll apply medicine to your wounds.

414
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,230
Why is Shen Zhong anxious to see me?

415
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,430
What's the matter?

416
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,230
He didn't tell me about it.

417
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,520
Is Langtao back to Shangjing?

418
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,280
I don't know.

419
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,520
Show me the way.

420
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,280
Got it.

421
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,830
Shout if it hurts.

422
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,710
Hearing what you said,

423
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,590
I think there're several things that don't make sense.

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,430
Are you still thinking about that?

425
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,470
Xiao En had a chance

426
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,560
to kill you on the way.

427
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,590
Why didn't he do it?

428
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,430
I don't know, either.

429
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,880
I remember

430
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,160
he mentioned Danzhou specially,

431
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,350
so I told him

432
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,430
I was brought up there.

433
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,590
And then?

434
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,470
He never mentioned it again.

435
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,590
If Xiao En is interested in Danzhou,

436
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,350
why didn't he make detailed inquiries?

437
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,520
How do I know that?

438
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,470
When you go back, remember to tell Head Chen

439
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,680
Xiao En's secrets

440
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,640
may have something to do with Danzhou.

441
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,640
Focus on getting yourself better,

442
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,830
or you can't go back.

443
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,640
Let's talk about it later.

444
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,190
Now tell me something about He Daoren.

445
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,920
I also didn't expect

446
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,640
Head Chen even bought over a Ninth Dan swordsman.

447
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,590
Has He Daoren

448
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,310
ever contacted you?

449
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,830
No.

450
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,400
Maybe Head Chen bought over He Daoren

451
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,710
just to give you a hand,

452
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,520
but you got him into big trouble.

453
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,680
Is that in your imagination?

454
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,160
Because of the excuse

455
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,190
he used to cheat Shen Zheng,

456
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,470
he'll be killed.

457
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,310
Fan Xian,

458
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,230
you underestimated Shen Zhong.

459
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,640
Your Excellency, Mr. He is here.

460
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,310
Your Excellency Shen, I wonder what's worrying you.

461
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,680
Two things.

462
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,470
One

463
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,280
is about Yan Bingyun of course.

464
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,110
Your Excellency Shen, don't need to blame yourself.

465
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,880
He'll be set free sooner or later.

466
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,640
It's all my sister's fault.

467
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,190
She's really muddleheaded.

468
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,430
She's young.

469
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,830
A girl at her age

470
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,710
usually focuses on love.

471
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,280
I'm ashamed of her doing that.

472
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,160
She must've been laughed at.

473
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
I wonder what's the other thing

474
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,040
that worries you.

475
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,520
Of course it's something about you.

476
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,350
Why did you say that?

477
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,160
As a Ninth Dan martial arts master in Shangjing,

478
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
you failed to keep Fan Xian under watch.

479
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,830
It's really weird.

480
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,920
As I said,

481
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,710
someone wearing a mask

482
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,680
stopped me that day.

483
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,920
Didn't you also suspect

484
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,070
it's Shangshan Hu?

485
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,400
I...

486
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,280
I just tried to give you an out.

487
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,520
That guy's timing

488
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,680
was perfect.

489
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,950
It means he had kept in contact with Fan Xian.

490
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,040
But since Fan Xian

491
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,070
came to Shangjing,

492
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,880
he's always been monitored.

493
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,520
Mr. He,

494
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,560
how do you think he managed to

495
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,070
communicate with Shangshan Hu?

496
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Your Excellency Shen, what do you mean?

497
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,680
That guy appeared at the perfect time.

498
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,800
It was really weird.

499
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,920
What if there was no such a person at all?

500
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,070
What if

501
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,070
it was a lie you made up

502
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,920
and it's you that let Fan Xian go?

503
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,640
Are you suspicious of me?

504
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,070
Yes.

505
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,880
In this case,

506
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,800
why didn't you put your cards on the table last time?

507
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,640
You're a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

508
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,110
In case we fell out,

509
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,590
I was not sure if I could defeat you.

510
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,760
So,

511
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,590
are you sure you can do it this time?

512
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,920
Langtao.

513
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,310
You'd better lie down and have a rest.

514
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Now that you asked He Daoren to do that,

515
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,760
Shen Zhong is bound to suspect him.

516
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,470
Just because I have no contact

517
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,310
with Shangshan Hu?

518
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,680
Shen Zhong is suspicious.

519
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,920
One loophole is enough.

520
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,350
Loophole?

521
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,880
Come in.

522
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,640
Your Excellency, Tan Wu...

523
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,040
I want to drink some water.

524
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,190
Have you finished fighting?

525
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,680
No. There is still a long queue.

526
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,040
I have a tight schedule.

527
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,280
They're all here to challenge you.

528
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,950
I appreciate your hard work.

529
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,830
I've enjoyed myself. I don't think it's tiring.

530
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,280
It's alright. If you have something to report,

531
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,470
you can say it in the presence of Mr. Yan.

532
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Shangshan Hu's subordinate asked me

533
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,920
when we'll take action.

534
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,110
Tell him

535
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,950
I'll give him a reply in two or three days.

536
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,640
Okay. I'll do that.

537
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,590
I'll leave you alone.

538
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,590
Have you kept in contact with Shangshan Hu?

539
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,190
He Daoren

540
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,230
works for Head Chen.

541
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,800
I won't let him lose his life for nothing.

542
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,230
With eyes watching,

543
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,000
how did Shangshan Hu

544
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,830
make contact with you?

545
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,400
Men can communicate with each other

546
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,350
through fighting.

547
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,590
Sorry for having kept you waiting.

548
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,590
=Tan Wu, Shangshan Hu's Deputy General of Beiqi=

549
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,560
It's okay.
=Tan Wu, Shangshan Hu's Deputy General of Beiqi=

550
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:40,700
=Tan Wu, Shangshan Hu's Deputy General of Beiqi=

551
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,430
Let's get started!

552
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,950
You'll get a reply

553
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,760
in two or three days.

554
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll report it to Grand General

555
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,710
and wait for the good news.

556
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,310
My master had an estimate of my capabilities.

557
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,400
Master Ku He?

558
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,590
Master said

559
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,800
among all Ninth Dan martial arts masters,

560
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,800
I'm ranked the third.

561
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,470
The top two

562
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,160
are not in Beiqi.

563
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,000
If you fight me,

564
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,590
you'll definitely die.

565
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,070
I've never betrayed Beiqi.

566
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,230
Then put down your sword.

567
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,280
Let's have a talk.

568
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,470
If I put down my sword,

569
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,520
I'd place myself at the mercy of you.

570
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,950
Your Excellency!

571
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,160
We found that

572
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,760
Shangshan Hu's subordinate Tan Wu

573
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,430
is fighting at the gate of the mission's residence.

574
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,040
Why didn't you report it until today?

575
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,560
He went there on the first day.

576
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,070
Then he never showed up again.

577
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,070
The guys who kept the mission under watch

578
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,350
thought he was there just to fight,

579
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,430
so they didn't report it.

580
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,000
But Tan Wu showed up again today.

581
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,950
Those guys

582
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,280
neglected their duties.

583
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Punish them at hard labor for a year.

584
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,070
Got it.

585
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,000
So, Shangshan Hu

586
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,680
really has kept in contact

587
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,230
with Fan Xian.

588
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,520
It may not be true.

589
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,190
Maybe

590
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,680
it's a trap set by me.

591
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,560
I thought too much.

592
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,590
Mr. He, please forgive me.

593
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,710
It's all for the sake of Beiqi.

594
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,110
If you're angry,

595
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,190
you can stab me

596
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,520
to vent your anger.

597
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,230
The timing is perfect.

598
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,800
Why did Tan Wu

599
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
reappear today?

600
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,160
He's here to discuss

601
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,230
the cooperation.

602
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,350
What will you do?

603
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,950
To save Xiao En.

604
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,560
Why do they want to cooperate with you?

605
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,920
Shangshan Hu doesn't know

606
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,310
where Xiao En is imprisoned.

607
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,950
Our cooperation is based on the premise

608
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,560
I find out where Xiao En is.

609
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,000
Why does he believe you can do that?

610
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,640
He didn't at the beginning,

611
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,560
so I asked him to wait.

612
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,070
If I save you,

613
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,430
my capabilities will be proven.

614
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,680
So, you asked He Daoren to tell lies

615
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
to save me.

616
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,950
When you do that,

617
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,710
Tan Wu would show up,

618
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,400
which in turn

619
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,470
would spare He Daoren

620
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,040
from suspicion.

621
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,400
These things linked with each other
and interacted as both cause and effect.

622
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,680
You're really capable.

623
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,950
You can say such words more often.

624
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,280
So, you know where Xiao En is?

625
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,000
No.

626
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,950
Can you find him?

627
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,040
No.

628
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,230
I found you

629
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,040
just because Lady Shen loves you.

630
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,120
I don't love her.

631
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,560
I got closer to her

632
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,950
just to collect military information.

633
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,710
Enough. Enough.

634
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,800
You don't need to explain it to me.

635
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,230
Now that you can't find Xiao En,

636
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,390
you're deceiving Shangshan Hu.

637
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,230
No.

638
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,040
I sincerely want to cooperate with him

639
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,910
and get Xiao En out.

640
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,670
Don't you want to kill Xiao En?

641
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,950
You can't do that if we can't get him out.

642
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,870
How will you get him out if you can't find him?

643
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,950
Haitang Duoduo told me

644
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,630
the little emperor of Beiqi wants to see me.

645
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,430
What on earth do you want to do?

646
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,840
It doesn't matter what I want to do.

647
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,190
It matters what relevant parties of Beiqi

648
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,520
want to do.

649
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,470
I'm just helping them

650
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,320
achieve their goals respectively.

651
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,560
As the Saintess, you're showing me the way personally.

652
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,230
I feel flattered.

653
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,390
Or are you

654
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,360
under the Empress Dowager's order

655
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,910
to keep watch on me and the little emperor?

656
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,190
You're talkative.

657
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,710
I can't believe

658
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,910
you're a double agent.

659
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,600
Come on. Is it related to you?

660
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,520
No.

661
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,840
I'm already engaged.

662
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,560
You're the Saintess.

663
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
Can't you be more like a lady?

664
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,390
Your Majesty, here I am.

665
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,430
Good job.

666
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,360
Shen Zhong took strict precautions against you,

667
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,040
but you really managed to

668
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,840
find Yan Bingyun's whereabouts.

669
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,710
Your thought and skills

670
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,150
are outstanding.

671
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,280
I'm just lucky.

672
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,230
If Shen Zhong didn't have a sister,

673
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,390
how would you find Yan Bingyun?

674
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,150
Of course to turn to you.

675
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,430
How do you know if I'd help you out?

676
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,950
You want me

677
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,080
to kill Shen Zhong.

678
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,520
We should help each other.

679
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,870
It'll be a story on everyone's lips.

680
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,000
So, do you agree to kill Shen Zhong?

681
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I have a condition.

682
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,520
Go ahead.

683
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,670
I want to know where Xiao En is.

684
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,390
And then?

685
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,870
To get him out.

686
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,000
How?

687
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,560
By cooperating with Shangshan Hu.

688
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,040
Xiao En was a high-ranking official of Beiqi.

689
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,870
Exactly.

690
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,390
Shangshan Hu is a famous general of Beiqi.

691
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,520
He's important.

692
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,230
You want to collude with our general

693
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,520
to break into a jail and rescue a prisoner.

694
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,320
And you're telling His Majesty about it.

695
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,710
I'm not just telling him.

696
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,190
I'm turning to him.

697
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,950
Your Majesty, you tell me where Xiao En is.

698
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,230
Shangshan Hu and I will get him out.

699
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,470
We can be considered partners.

700
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,280
You want to break into a prison of Beiqi

701
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,910
and conspire with the emperor of Beiqi?

702
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,910
As I said,

703
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,840
we should help each other.

704
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,840
As I said,

705
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,870
he's extremely daring.

706
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,760
Mr. Fan, tell me

707
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,670
why I should conspire with you.

708
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,600
Your Majesty,

709
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,800
what will Shen Zhong do

710
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
if Shangshan Hu tries to save Xiao En?

711
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,600
He'll do all he can to stop it.

712
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,870
Who is better at martial arts,

713
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,040
Shen Zhong or Shangshan Hu?

714
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,560
Shen Zhong is no match for Shangshan Hu.

715
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,280
Okay.

716
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,560
While Shangshan Hu wants to save Xiao En,

717
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,710
Shen Zhong is bound to stop it.

718
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,230
In this case, they're sure to fight.

719
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,470
Do you want to see Shen Zhong be killed

720
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,280
by Shangshan Hu?

721
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,230
Yes, for your sake.

722
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,150
If Shen Zhong is killed,

723
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,600
Shangshan Hu deserves the harshest punishment.

724
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,710
So, you can arrest him

725
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,430
and execute him later.

726
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,710
You want to kill

727
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,760
both Shen Zhong and Shangshan Hu.

728
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,600
Are you aiming to

729
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,150
weaken Beiqi?

730
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,760
Shangshan Hu doesn't take orders from you

731
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,120
or from the Empress Dowager.

732
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,560
And he enjoys an awe-inspiring reputation in the military.

733
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,870
Can you set your mind at rest

734
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,430
if he's alive?

735
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,520
Mr. Fan, you're really brainy.

736
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,670
I kind of agree.

737
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,150
What if Shen Zhong survives?

738
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,280
Even if he's not killed,

739
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,000
he's neglected his duties because Xiao En is saved.

740
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,600
By then,

741
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,080
you can punish him and remove him from office.

742
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,950
In that case,

743
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,600
he can be killed any time.

744
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,760
You've considered

745
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,910
everything about it.

746
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,470
It took me lots of efforts

747
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,280
to think of these ideas.

748
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,280
It's for the sake of you.

749
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,190
You did all this

750
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,230
for the sake of me?

751
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,390
Or else?

752
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,710
Your Majesty,

753
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,870
you haven't told me where Xiao En is.

754
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,360
Is he going to the bathroom?

755
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,950
Xiao En is imprisoned out of town.

756
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,040
I'll tell you

757
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,520
the specific place when I see you out.

758
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,560
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

759
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,910
We're cooperation partners!

760
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,710
Did Fan Xian go to see Shangshan Hu?

761
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,760
Exactly.

762
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,150
Not in a sneaky way?

763
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,230
No. He was fully at ease.

764
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,760
Where did he go before that?

765
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,190
The imperial palace. He was called in by His Majesty.

766
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,320
Called in again?

767
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,150
What did they talk about?

768
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,840
According to a message from the Empress Dowager,

769
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,760
the Saintess stayed with them.

770
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,600
They just talked about some poems and essays

771
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,000
instead of anything else.

772
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,280
Why did Fan Xian go to see Shangshan Hu?

773
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,600
And he did it openly, not afraid of being seen.

774
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,950
You came to see me

775
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,280
openly like this.

776
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,190
Shen Zhong is bound to find it out.

777
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,080
Won't he find it out

778
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,190
if we meet in a concealed place?

779
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,080
Even if I choose a concealed place,

780
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,080
your subordinate Tan Wu

781
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,800
showed up twice at the gate of the mission's residence.

782
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,710
Do you think Shen Zhong wouldn't notice it?

783
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Besides,

784
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,950
even if I don't come to see you,

785
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,600
will Shen Zhong stop

786
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,520
taking strict precautions against you?

787
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,040
Now that you dare to see me,

788
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,560
I don't think you're afraid of

789
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,430
Shen Zhong.

790
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,760
Am I right?

791
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,560
I really want to kill you.

792
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,320
Why do you say that?

793
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,520
Judging from your style,

794
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,120
you'll be a formidable enemy of Beiqi.

795
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,760
How will you save Master Xiao En

796
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,360
if I'm dead?

797
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,150
Have you found out where he is?

798
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,950
Exactly.

799
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,230
How did you find it out?

800
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,320
It's not important.

801
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,280
Where is he?

802
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,230
I think

803
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,470
it's better to figure out a plan first.

804
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,360
We shouldn't do it hastily, right?

805
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,190
What do you want to do?

806
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,670
Shen Zhong is so cruel

807
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,470
to Master Xiao.

808
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,390
Do you want to take revenge?

809
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,000
Go ahead.

810
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,760
Actually, it's easy to guess.

811
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,360
What he wants

812
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,520
is just Xiao En.

813
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
But Fan Xian doesn't know

814
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,430
where Xiao En is imprisoned.

815
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,710
Do you know why

816
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,710
I detained Xiao En?

817
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,870
No. I don't.

818
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,430
Just for this moment.

819
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,230
Go to

820
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,190
get He Daoren and Langtao here.

821
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,320
Got it.

822
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,700
In the river of history,

823
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,900
time goes round and round.

824
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,260
Memories about the former and present lives

825
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,140
join each other in an endless way.

826
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,740
In the long drunken Milky Way,

827
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,460
one season follows another in a flash,

828
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,660
and the wild geese are flying south.

829
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,580
I just can't give up

830
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,580
to be with you for my whole life.

831
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,860
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

832
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

833
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,540
Year after year in the wandering,

834
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,100
I count the remaining years.

835
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,300
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

836
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,860
even though we have ended up the destiny,

837
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,540
I never feel regretful.

838
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,500
In such a chaotic world,

839
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,260
I still miss you as ever.

840
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,900
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

841
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,620
With a gentle heart,

842
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,180
I cherish our remaining years.

843
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,020
Even though we have to go through

844
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,980
all the hardships along the journey,

845
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:17,300
you always stay by my side,

846
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,060
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

847
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,980
Year after year in the wandering,

848
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,340
I count the remaining years.

849
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,700
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

850
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,500
even though we end up the destiny,

851
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,940
I never feel regretful.

852
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,860
In such a chaotic world,

853
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,820
I still miss you as ever.

854
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,500
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

855
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,260
With a gentle heart,

856
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,660
I cherish our remaining years.

857
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,460
Even though we have to go through

858
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,620
all the hardships along the journey,

859
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:57,900
you always stay by my side...
