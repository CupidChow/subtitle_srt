1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 32

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,080
Your Majesty, everyone is here.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,630
We can start the meal.

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
This is a family meal.

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,230
Help yourselves!

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,120
Your Majesty,

21
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,120
since it's a family meal,

22
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,510
my presence is improper.

23
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,190
You're thick-skinned. It's alright!

24
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,440
Go ahead with it!

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,320
I don't feel myself today

26
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,470
and can't eat anything.

27
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,000
So, I don't eat

28
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,630
and I'll watch you eating.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,390
We haven't had any gathering for a long time.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,960
I've got a lot of memorials to handle.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,000
So liquor won't be served. There you go!

32
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,360
Help yourselves!

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,160
This is not on imperial court.

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
Don't stand on ceremony.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,080
He was rigid ever since he was young.

36
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,110
Now he is still a piece of wood.

37
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,390
Look at him!

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,550
Never showed much table manners from childhood.

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,360
He is still like this.

40
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,470
Fan Xian!

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,470
Yes, Your Majesty!

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,000
Who do you think is more promising of them two?

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,160
This is a family meal. You can speak at will!

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,750
No conviction?

45
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,720
No!

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
Then I'm gonna say it.

47
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,390
Your Majesty, are you playing a joke with me?

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,030
This question will put me

49
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,320
in a deep trap.

50
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,960
No matter how I answer it,

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
it's leading me to death.

52
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,190
Loyal ministers don't fear death.

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,160
If all loyal ministers die,

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
there would be only sinister ministers left.

55
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,080
Are you the loyal type

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,190
or the sinister type?

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,390
It's up to Your Majesty.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,030
I'm OK either way.

59
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,470
How do you two

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,190
think of him?

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,390
Spectacularly talented and important to the kingdom.

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
Loyal ministers and sinister ministers are common.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,720
But crafty loyal ministers are rare.

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,880
Important

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
and rare!

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,390
They are really high comments to him.

67
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,480
He deserves

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
however high comments.

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,950
If so,

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
he should be protected

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,230
in future.

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,070
No matter whichever one of you take over the throne,

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,600
he should be an important minister on court.

74
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,070
Your Majesty is still young and strong.

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,440
You'll live a long life.

76
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,720
I agree.

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
Live a long life?

78
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,480
If I live a long life,

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,230
will you be happy

80
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,670
or unhappy?

81
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,510
Come on! Take a seat!

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,760
Go on with it!

83
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,230
Hurry!

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,110
Do you like it?

85
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,390
Your Majesty,

86
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,070
I don't know.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,920
You don't know?

88
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,110
I was too nervous to feel the taste of it.

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,760
All the officials from the six divisions

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,950
reported the other day that

91
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,760
you leaked highly confidential information

92
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,790
which is related

93
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,440
to Yan Bingyun's being trapped in Beiqi.

94
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,550
Do you know it?

95
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,760
I've heard of it.

96
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,040
Me too.

97
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,160
You have a lot of followers

98
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,390
with a wide network of adherents.

99
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,160
It's bad enough

100
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,390
if it's spread out there

101
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,550
for just a few days.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,760
I have no adherents,

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,720
but I'll still eradicate the misunderstandings

104
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,760
from an impartial standpoint.

105
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,760
I do have some friends

106
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,070
on the court.

107
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,600
I'll warn the ones who need to be warned

108
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,160
and persuade the ones who need to be.

109
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,790
I'll stop the rumor from confusing the masses.

110
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,200
Fan Xian,

111
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,950
you need to prove yourself innocent

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,920
and resolve this.

113
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,160
How do Your Majesty want me to handle it?

114
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,350
Escort Xiao En to Beiqi

115
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,480
and get Yan Bingyun back .

116
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,510
We are in short of a leader.

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,550
Your Majesty want me

118
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,440
to go to Beiqi for the exchange?

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,230
Only your personal participation

120
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,070
can erase the misgivings on court.

121
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,270
Is that an imperial edict?

122
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,040
It's a suggestion

123
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,000
which depends on you.

124
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,640
Remember what I said.

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,230
No matter what you're requested,

126
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,670
don't promise

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
unless you're clearly requested to with an imperial edict.

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,070
Fan Xian, you had been to the Lin's Residence

129
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,270
before coming to the palace?

130
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,350
Yes, I did.

131
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,000
Prime Minister has a lot of practical experience.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,760
You should listen to him.

133
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,040
If I don't want to go to Beiqi,

134
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,830
does that constitute disobedience to the imperial edict?

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,720
No!

136
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,200
But your engagement has to be changed.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,670
What do you mean?

138
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,200
There are a lot of misgivings from the six divisions on you.

139
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,550
If you marry Lin Wan'er

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
and take over the Neiku,

141
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,270
that doesn't make much sense.

142
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,440
It's not too bad for you.

143
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
If that's the case,

144
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,880
you can fix another marriage contract

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,110
as there are a lot of good ladies in the capital city.

146
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I'd like to go to Beiqi.

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,480
Think about it. Think about it.

148
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,230
I'm not forcing you.

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,390
You must think about it carefully.

150
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,950
I really want to go. I can't wait.

151
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,720
Alright!

152
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,230
Ask Chen Pingping for the schedule.

153
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,510
I'll hold the wedding for you

154
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,510
after you come back from Beiqi.

155
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,720
Thank you, Your Majesty!

156
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,110
I'm a bit tired and need a rest.

157
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,640
Finish it by yourselves.

158
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm fine!

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,230
I'm fine!

160
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
By the way, Fan Xian,

161
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,030
I prepared a gift for you.

162
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,260
=Xinyang=

163
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,760
Rise!

164
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,710
Are you waiting for me?

165
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,960
I want to say goodbye here to Your Highness.

166
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,550
You lost the title as Director

167
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,960
and got banished to defend the remote boarders

168
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,280
because of me.

169
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,080
It's hurting me

170
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,400
inside my heart.

171
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,640
Fan Xian was assigned by His Majesty to go north.

172
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,550
The journey starts immediately.

173
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,590
Got that!

174
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,960
Your Highness, a message from the court

175
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,840
says Fan Xian will lead a mission to go north.

176
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,550
Very good!

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,760
The boarder is remote and deserted.

178
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,880
It's inevitable to have accidents.

179
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,670
My place of stationing

180
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
is also on the way to the north.

181
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,150
As soon as I get Fan Xian's schedule,

182
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,320
I'll have that delivered to you very fast.

183
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,790
I'll wait for that.

184
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
What are you looking at?

185
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,080
Eh!

186
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,710
Look at these flowers.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,440
There is abundant water and sunshine.

188
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,000
Why are they all withered?

189
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,910
The horrifying Head Chen

190
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,910
is now worried about the flowers by the side of the wall.

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,790
They were planted by your mom years back.

192
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,230
If you're worried,

193
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,150
we can have it trimmed by a gardener

194
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,670
or moved into a flowerpot.

195
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,280
Your mom said

196
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,110
it has its own destiny.

197
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,640
Let it grow as it likes.

198
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,400
So it's always left unattended?

199
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,280
Yeah!

200
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,640
No matter how far I go these years,

201
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
I had been thinking about them.

202
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,110
Yeah!

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,110
No matter how far I go recently,

204
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,150
I had been thinking about them.

205
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,670
I was afraid of losing them after I came back.

206
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,790
They may not be able to

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,880
go through this winter.

208
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,320
You miss her?

209
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,760
It's alright! These flowers can still be saved.

210
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,590
They are in lack of potassium.

211
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,960
Potassium?

212
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,640
I've grown some medical herbs

213
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,470
while I was learning poison from the teacher.

214
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,840
I will make some medicine powder

215
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,000
and save these flowers with it.

216
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Don't worry. I am its destiny.

217
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,350
Your mom planted them and you save them.

218
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,440
That's also destiny.

219
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,150
The journey this time

220
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
is both a test and an opportunity.

221
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,030
But bear in mind

222
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,910
to get Yan Bingyun back

223
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,080
in a safe way.

224
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,550
Got it.

225
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,320
One more point.

226
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,790
Stay vigilant to one person.

227
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,710
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

228
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,110
You must be careful with him.

229
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,000
He is a very dangerous person.

230
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,280
It mustn't be someone good

231
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,350
who can be remembered by you.

232
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,440
All the rest documents

233
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,110
have been put on your carriage.

234
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
Read them on the way.

235
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,880
You must memorize the political situation of Beiqi.

236
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,590
Sure!

237
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,550
You're leaving for Beiqi

238
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,840
in a few days.

239
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,640
I'll send people to protect you secretly

240
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,110
in case Princess Royal does something bad to you.

241
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,790
Sure!

242
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,520
Have you met Lin Ruofu?

243
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,440
Yes!

244
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,550
What did he say?

245
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,150
He asked me

246
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,960
not to promise anything

247
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,200
required by His Majesty.

248
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,110
But you promised it all.

249
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,520
His Majesty said

250
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,000
if I don't go to Beiqi,

251
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,710
my marriage will be changed.

252
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,840
Even though the task of visiting Beiqi

253
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,080
is important this time,

254
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,760
it is not as important

255
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,760
as your life.

256
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,280
I think you're a good person.

257
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,110
Me?

258
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,350
A good person?

259
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,910
It's your first time

260
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,030
to say something like this over the years.

261
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,470
I have a good sense of judgement which can save a lot of trouble.

262
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,520
After you come back from the north,

263
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,710
you can gradually take over

264
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,550
the Investigator's Office.

265
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,230
By then, the Neiku and the Investigator's Office

266
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,840
will be all in your hands.

267
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,350
I'll assist you secretly

268
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,440
to turn you into the No.1 minister of Nanqing.

269
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,470
No one will be able to jeopardize

270
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,110
your safety by then.

271
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,590
Not even His Majesty?

272
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,670
You shouldn't ask like that.

273
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,550
I'll keep my mouth shut!

274
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,590
Let's go!

275
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,670
Someone is waiting for you in the Bagua Hall.

276
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,150
Waiting for me?

277
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,880
You'll see after you arrive.

278
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,440
I think

279
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,230
poison A4 is the best.

280
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,350
I think B3

281
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,280
is the most difficult to detoxicate.

282
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,420
What if

283
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
=Senior Fellow Apprentice Leng, Acting Director=
What if

284
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:56,550
What if

285
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,400
you poison yourself?

286
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,200
Well...

287
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,280
Junior Fellow Apprentice, do you still remember me?

288
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,520
Senior Fellow Apprentice Leng?

289
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,710
Yeah! Yeah!

290
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,320
Mr. Fei is away.
I'm in temporary charge of the Third Division.

291
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,960
I heard you're going to Beiqi?

292
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,150
The Third Division

293
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,200
prepared something for you.

294
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Come and check it out.

295
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,150
Nice to meet you, Senior Fellow Apprentices!

296
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,200
Nice to meet you, Junior Fellow Apprentice!

297
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,520
Let's catch up later.

298
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,470
Come over here.

299
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,110
You are in pretty good shape.

300
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,350
This is the right size.

301
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,200
Come on. Have a try!

302
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,840
What is it?

303
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,080
See!

304
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,790
It is fire-proof when worn inside.

305
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,880
But it can't resist constant burning.

306
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,640
It can also defend you from

307
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,110
the harm of some sharp weapons.

308
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,400
If your enemy

309
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,470
uses machete axe,

310
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,520
you'd better evade from that.

311
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,470
This is a newly-developed crossbow.

312
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,960
Pad here and it'll shoot the arrows.

313
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,560
Wrong direction.

314
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,070
It's very hidden

315
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,400
but not so destructive.

316
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,110
It is deadly only if shot to lethal parts.

317
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,110
Never mind!

318
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
A4 poison is easy to be detoxicated.

319
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,110
He will come back to life

320
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,190
after a while.

321
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,920
Umbrella cover made of asbestos cloth.

322
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,400
Very strong umbrella structure.

323
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,230
Open it when falling down from high.

324
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,880
It'll help reduce the speed of falling.

325
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,040
This rope can sustain

326
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,560
the weight of four to five people

327
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,470
without a problem.

328
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
You can strangle a few people

329
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,110
with it when you feel bored.

330
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
This looks just like a jade pendant.

331
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,640
You can smash it in times of emergency

332
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,230
and hide yourself.

333
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,190
I have put some piquant powder as well

334
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,070
which can stop the enemies.

335
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,350
Open the door quickly!

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,950
No!

337
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,400
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

338
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,950
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

339
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,040
Don't swing it. There are needles in it.

340
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,710
Look!

341
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,070
It's C6 poison on them

342
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,110
which is not lethal but will make you itchy.

343
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,800
Itchy.

344
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,470
Given that you're not going on a battlefield,

345
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,920
you don't need to

346
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,190
carry these big articles.

347
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,310
These are already enough.

348
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,110
By the way,

349
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,110
Mr. Fei has also said that

350
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,070
you've learned the essence of applying poison,

351
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,880
so we didn't prepare any poison for you.

352
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,950
Senior Fellow Apprentice, I don't have the ingredients.

353
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,280
Tell me what you need.

354
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,280
Maokouzi, arsenic stones

355
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,830
nux vomica, and Nanhai camphor tree.

356
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,760
Wait a second!

357
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,160
Maokouzi is too bitter.

358
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,000
It's not a good choice.

359
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,830
Arsenic stones and nux vomica

360
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,800
should not be hard to find.

361
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,520
It's not convenient to buy these given my identity.

362
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,640
It can catch others' attention too easily.

363
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,470
OK! OK! OK!

364
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,070
That's not a problem. The Third Division has got plenty.

365
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,560
You probably need to bring

366
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,350
some chloroform as well.

367
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,680
New poison?

368
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,760
Newly developed knockout drops.

369
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,000
Mr. Fei has tested it before.

370
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,190
He said it works better than nux vomica.

371
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,040
Is it easy to detoxicate?

372
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,880
As easy as it is for Youyexiang.

373
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,040
So that explains it.

374
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
Can we replace the arrow poison

375
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,000
with arsenic stones?

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,190
That works much faster.

377
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,310
Murder!

378
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,710
Your Excellency, please get off the carriage!

379
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:22,760
What happened?

380
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,070
There are enemies ahead trying to attack us.

381
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,880
Who are they?

382
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,560
I didn't see clearly.

383
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,470
We've lost touch

384
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,640
with most of the people protecting Your Excellency.

385
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,680
They are very terrific people.

386
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,920
How about Your Excellency leaving first?

387
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,710
I'll defend at the back.

388
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,470
Your Excellency. Leave first.

389
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,710
Everyone from the Third Division comes here.

390
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,640
People protecting Your Excellency are completely annihilated.

391
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,590
Your Excellency. Go now!

392
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,740
Mr. Fei!

393
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,190
=Fei Jie, Director of the Third Division=
Teacher!

394
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,700
=Fei Jie, Director of the Third Division of
the Investigator's Office=

395
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,110
It stinks!

396
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,430
The Third Division's crossbow.

397
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,400
No. 3 poison. Oh no!

398
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,950
No. 4 poison.

399
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,350
You're back!

400
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,880
Just now

401
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
I saw a lot of sneaky people

402
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,160
around you.

403
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,680
It's alright now.

404
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,110
I've knocked them down.

405
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,520
Why do you look at me like that?

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,830
They are from the Sixth Division?

407
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,230
They protected me.

408
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,470
The Investigator's Office has too many people.

409
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,560
I don't know them all.

410
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,040
They are not dead, are they?

411
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,760
No!

412
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,310
My poison is not lethal.

413
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,830
Let's go!

414
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,070
Your Excellency!

415
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,640
Mr. Fei!

416
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,830
Well, he...

417
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,800
I'm serving

418
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,710
His Excellency Fan now.

419
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,430
Let's go together.

420
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
Mr. Fei, haven't seen you for ages.

421
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,590
Your Majesty!

422
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,950
Are you here to argue?

423
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,560
I dare not to.

424
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,470
Then you're here for Fan Xian.

425
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,110
Beiqi is our enemy after all.

426
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,520
It doesn't have to be him

427
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,230
for the visit.

428
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,230
Minister Lu has left his position
for his hometown due to sickness.

429
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,710
You can take his place

430
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,640
as the Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

431
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,280
I'm here not for promotion.

432
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,070
I can give up the Assistant Minister

433
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,950
if I can stop Fan Xian from going north.

434
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,800
You want to breach the laws
and regulations of the imperial court?

435
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,590
What if he gets killed?

436
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,760
He should take up more challenges

437
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,190
as a young man

438
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,070
otherwise how will he take up bigger responsibilities?

439
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,110
Then leave the bigger responsibilities.

440
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,070
Do you know what I like about you?

441
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,590
A lot of people don't wish him to go!

442
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,920
You are the only one who comes to me for it.

443
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,520
If someone else comes for it,

444
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,350
it's a disobedience to the law.

445
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,350
Who do Your Majesty mean?

446
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,830
You have to take over the position

447
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,590
of Minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

448
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,040
So does Fan Xian with his visit.

449
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,400
Your Majesty!

450
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,520
No bargaining!

451
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,470
Then please allow my personal guards

452
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,830
to protect him on the way north.

453
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,000
Don't do this again!

454
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,760
You want me to help you stand up?

455
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,160
Leave!

456
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,640
=Rouge Shop=

457
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,470
No problem!
=Rouge Shop=

458
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,020
Help me out! Which one looks better?
=Rouge Shop=

459
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,800
Help me out! Which one looks better?

460
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,400
Does this one look good?

461
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,310
Let me see!

462
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,880
Let me do it for you!

463
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,950
Let's exchange.

464
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,520
How about that one?

465
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Much better now!

466
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,070
That one is really nice.

467
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,710
-What about this one? -This?

468
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,560
No problem. Most people like it.

469
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,470
That's not the look that I want.

470
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,520
This one doesn't look good!

471
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,230
I think it's pretty.

472
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,920
How do you guys get in?

473
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,680
My grandson is getting married.

474
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,880
We want to prepare some rouge for the bride.

475
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,430
He's shy.

476
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,680
Get out of the way!

477
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,560
Let the boss help us with it.

478
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,520
Handsome boy! Handsome boy!

479
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,070
You're really gorgeous!

480
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,590
We all like you.

481
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,520
His daughter doesn't deserve you.

482
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,920
My daughter does!

483
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,880
Don't go!

484
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,230
She is an absolute beauty!

485
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,000
What a pity!

486
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,430
He didn't even talk to us.

487
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,710
Let's go! Let's go!

488
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,310
I'm so envious.

489
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,350
Take your seat!

490
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,470
Just like what it was in Danzhou.

491
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,070
I'll be fine to stand.

492
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,470
Who runs the shop?

493
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,950
Me!

494
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,760
You run a rouge shop?

495
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,280
I went to apply poison in Beiqi the other year.

496
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,430
My target was a woman.

497
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,560
I had the idea

498
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,400
to make some poisonous rouge.

499
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,920
But that was awfully made.

500
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,800
She didn't like it

501
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,710
and refuse to use it.

502
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,590
That was an accident

503
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,590
which almost caused big trouble.

504
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,000
Then you opened up this shop?

505
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
Your Excellency may not know that

506
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,000
these women

507
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,920
might be very picky

508
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,800
with the choice of rouge.

509
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,350
But when it comes to the payment,

510
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,640
they are really generous

511
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,710
and ostentatious.

512
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,070
My wife is just like that.

513
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,350
Mr. Fei is really wise

514
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,800
to run such a lucrative shop.

515
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,470
It has nothing to do with money.

516
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Then why do you run this shop?

517
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,110
Ever since then,

518
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,680
I always have that incident in mind.

519
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,000
If it ever happens again,

520
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,110
there can't be any mistakes.

521
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,920
So the shop sustains.

522
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,590
For many years?

523
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,400
For a lot of years.

524
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,680
How serious was that incident

525
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,920
that you still remember it now?

526
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,310
That incident

527
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,760
took the legs of Chen Pingping.

528
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,040
Everyone poisoned?

529
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,040
Yes!

530
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,710
After I woke up,

531
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,400
Director-General Fan was already gone.

532
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,830
I've sent my people to search for him.

533
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,190
Head,

534
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,920
should we send people from the First Division as well?

535
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,830
The guy who kidnapped Director-General Fan

536
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,950
is super vicious.

537
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,310
We'd better search for him through the whole city.

538
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,710
Did anyone see his face?

539
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,280
Yes!

540
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,230
Tell me about it.

541
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,880
Xiao En was the King of Spy

542
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,280
in Beiqi at the time.

543
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,160
He's constantly moving from place to place.

544
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,070
It took a lot of manpower

545
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,760
to get the intelligence that his son would get married.

546
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,400
Chen Pingping led an army and travelled a thousand miles

547
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,830
to capture him alive.

548
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,470
I've heard about that.

549
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,400
I arrived first that time.

550
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,190
Xiao En and his son were pretty vigilant.

551
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,280
I planned to poison his daughter-in-law

552
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,560
so that I can threaten him and his son.

553
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,830
But the rouge went wrong.

554
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,470
The Investigator's Office

555
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,640
lost half of its manpower in that battle.

556
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,310
His son and daughter-in-law died on site.

557
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,950
Chen Pingping lost his legs.

558
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,430
I always think

559
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,310
if I didn't make the mistake.

560
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,070
Will the situation be any different

561
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,830
from what it is now?

562
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,280
It will be the same.

563
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,710
How could people like Xiao En

564
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,520
surrender himself

565
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,230
just because his daughter-in-law got poisoned?

566
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,110
No one will know

567
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,760
if it would be the same or not.

568
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
I heard that

569
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,590
you're going to escort Xiao En to Beiqi.

570
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,470
Yes.

571
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,950
To get Yan Bingyun back.

572
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,430
Which jerk comes up with such a lousy idea?

573
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,230
Don't go!

574
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,230
It is His Majesty's idea.

575
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,400
You must flee from the capital city.

576
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,430
Get prepared.

577
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
We set out tonight.

578
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,400
Teacher!

579
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,280
Xiao En deeply hates the Investigator's Office.

580
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,520
We can't hold back the relationship

581
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,800
between you and me or Chen Pingping from him.

582
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,310
How will you cope with Xiao En

583
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,920
after you get to Beiqi?

584
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,430
Teacher, I can manage it.

585
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,470
Just listen to me on this.

586
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Leave tonight.

587
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,560
I'll sort out the route of fleeing.

588
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,640
No!

589
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Mr. Fei, how about me?

590
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,350
Wait for us.

591
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,110
Flee with us together at dusk.

592
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,070
No,

593
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,430
my wife and daughter

594
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,640
are all in the capital city.

595
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,520
What does that have to do with me?

596
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,470
Teacher,

597
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,640
neither the Investigator's Office

598
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
nor the Imperial Guards will let me go!

599
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,520
I'll kill

600
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,000
whoever stands in our way.

601
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,680
Including me?

602
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
How do you know this place?

603
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,400
I know it all the time.

604
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,230
Fan Xian can't go to Beiqi.

605
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,000
You know the consequence to act against the imperial edict.

606
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,560
If Fan Xian flees,

607
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,800
he will have no ground to stand in Nanqing

608
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,160
for the rest of his life.

609
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,310
That's not any worse than dying in Beiqi.

610
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,280
So what?

611
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,950
You want him to be like you

612
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,110
who travels around the world

613
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,880
and never be able to see

614
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,000
families or friends?

615
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,430
I am old.

616
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,230
Over all the years I've spent in the Investigator's Office,

617
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,040
I've seen enough of this type

618
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,560
of life and death farewell.

619
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,640
I can't watch him dying.

620
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,710
Besides,

621
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,110
after I die,

622
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,280
there is gotta be someone burying me.

623
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,160
I can't find anyone else

624
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,280
other than Fan Xian.

625
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,880
If only one person can live in the world,

626
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,400
I will surely choose Fan Xian.

627
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,230
Then why do you let him

628
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,760
escort Xiao En to Beiqi?

629
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,230
Do you know?

630
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,640
After he comes back this time,

631
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,470
the future of the capital city

632
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,160
will all be in his hands.

633
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,160
That's too dangerous, Head Chen.

634
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,560
Whose life isn't dangerous?

635
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,760
If he shall live

636
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
under your shadow and mine,

637
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,590
he'll be ruined.

638
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,830
Don't worry!

639
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,640
I'll ensure his safety.

640
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,680
Stand up!

641
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,680
I'll trust you if you stand up now.

642
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,920
It was because of me back then

643
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,880
that you lost your legs.

644
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,430
Your Excellency!

645
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,680
Teacher,

646
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,710
I'm willing to go to Beiqi.

647
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,520
Li Yunrui betrayed Yan Bingyun

648
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,040
to destroy me.

649
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm the cause of it.

650
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,190
So I have to get him back.

651
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,070
So beautiful!

652
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,920
Didn't you say

653
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,040
you have important things to tell me?

654
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,760
Why don't you talk?

655
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm going to Beiqi.

656
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,400
I know.

657
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,950
Actually, I don't want to go.

658
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,880
Then don't!

659
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,680
The worse result is to disappoint His Majesty's will

660
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,160
and go back to Danzhou with you.

661
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,760
If I don't go to Beiqi,

662
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,280
the marriage contract will be gone.

663
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,520
That's the idea of His Majesty?

664
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,560
Who else's could it be?

665
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,760
We can elope.

666
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,470
I've saved up a little bit of money.

667
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,190
If we keep ourselves frugal,

668
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,430
it's enough for our whole lives.

669
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,110
The only thing is the Investigator's Office may come after us.

670
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,160
How about

671
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,470
going out on the sea?

672
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,190
Set out on sail with a large boat.

673
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,560
We stop at wherever it goes

674
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,430
until no one

675
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,800
can find us.

676
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,560
Setting out on sail

677
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,880
means never being able to come back.

678
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,880
Aren't you afraid?

679
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,160
You will protect me, right?

680
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,640
You're too adorable. I couldn't hold it.

681
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,760
I'm serious.

682
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,670
If you elope with me,

683
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,470
do you know how many people will laugh at you?

684
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,360
I don't care.

685
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,120
I do!

686
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,560
Wait for me to come back.

687
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,470
After I come back from Beiqi,

688
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,190
let's get married.

689
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,230
I don't want you

690
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,630
to force yourself

691
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,040
into something you don't like for me.

692
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,000
Not at all.

693
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,670
Knowing that we can get married after I come back,

694
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,230
I wish I could set out tonight.

695
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,280
Aren't you afraid of being watched?

696
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,000
No!

697
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
I've sent them away.

698
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,230
You sent them away?

699
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,320
So you did plan it.

700
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,760
Come on! I'm about to leave.

701
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,040
Take it as a farewell gift.

702
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,120
Wait! Stand straight.

703
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,600
Put your hands at the back and don't move.

704
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,230
We must agree on three points of law.

705
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,760
Firstly, don't flirt with any other ladies in Beiqi.

706
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,870
No one but you would accept me.

707
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,230
What if there is someone?

708
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,950
I accept no one but you.

709
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,600
I couldn't hold it.

710
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,080
Why do you laugh?

711
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,150
No, I don't.

712
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,760
I couldn't help enjoying the aftertaste.

713
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,230
You said three points of law.

714
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,470
So what are the rest two points?

715
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,320
I haven't come up yet.

716
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,670
No worries. Take your time.

717
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,120
What are you doing?

718
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,430
I miss you already.

719
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,630
You haven't left yet.

720
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,950
I start to miss you even before I leave.

721
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,120
Fine, but hold you mouth back from me.

722
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,670
Sure, whatever you say.

723
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,080
Listen to me carefully.

724
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
You must come back alive

725
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,390
from this journey.

726
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,320
I'll be waiting for you here

727
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,190
with cherry flowers.

728
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,910
Xie Bi'an

729
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,190
is not only good sword

730
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,600
but also a scary one.

731
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,670
Let him in.

732
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,150
You sent Wan'er back?

733
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,950
I don't remember having such pavilion before.

734
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,950
Just built it.

735
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,470
Watch out!

736
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,560
There is no base!

737
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
This will be removed after the drink.

738
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,520
This is just for a drink?

739
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,430
You can't leave me waiting

740
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,600
in the middle of the road, right?

741
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,520
So I built this pavilion.

742
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,670
Why do you look at me like that?

743
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,430
As a prince,

744
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,280
wouldn't it be a breach of duty

745
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,280
if I don't live extravagantly?

746
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,600
That makes sense.

747
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,950
A toast to you.

748
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,470
Good liquor.

749
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,230
Is it?

750
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,910
With the support of this scenery,

751
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,360
any liquor can be good.

752
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,080
When do you set out?

753
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,560
In a couple of days.

754
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,320
When you come back,

755
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,120
you'll enjoy enviable reputation.

756
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,190
By then, the imperial examinations
held in spring will start soon.

757
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,760
I'll plead His Majesty

758
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,000
to appoint you as the examiner.

759
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,280
I don't have any reputation.

760
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,080
The title of the Poetic Genius Fan is enough.

761
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,320
Once you organize the imperial examinations held in spring,

762
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,190
you'll become the examiner of those students.

763
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,190
It's hard to fully describe

764
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,040
the advantages behind it.

765
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,000
Feel it yourself.

766
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,280
I'm just curious

767
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
why Your Highness give such a good chance

768
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,230
to me.

769
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,710
You're not hateful

770
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,150
and can drink with me together.

771
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,000
Even if you follow the Crown Prince in the end,

772
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,390
we can still be friends.

773
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,230
Your Highness is most generous.

774
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
This world is full of common people.

775
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,520
There aren't many people

776
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,000
with whom you can open your heart.

777
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,080
I've read your poems.

778
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,390
"The capital city has so many officials.

779
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,760
Only this one guy looks frustrated and unhappy."

780
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,840
There are certain sincerity behind it.

781
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,360
There are a lot of routes to the north.

782
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,360
The guardian at Fengming Pass is my follower.

783
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,360
If you go through there, I'll ask him to protect you.

784
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,040
Thank you,

785
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,630
but we probably won't go through Fengming

786
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,760
this time.

787
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,430
Because it's a long route.

788
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,560
Then forget about it.

789
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,280
The feast is over and now it's time to move apart.

790
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,630
It is a pretty good day.

791
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,600
I'll wait for your return.

792
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,000
See you!

793
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,040
Don't tell anyone

794
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,800
about which pass you'll go through

795
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,950
for today's journey.

796
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,040
Keep the decision to yourself only.

797
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,390
I understand.

798
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,800
Your poison technique is better than ever.

799
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,120
This is newly made.

800
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,870
Smash it at critical moment.

801
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,670
It won't take any lives

802
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,630
or hurt anyone physically,

803
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,950
but even Great Masters

804
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,080
will sleep quite a while from it.

805
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,760
Thank you, Teacher!

806
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,470
No problem.

807
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,630
Just don't show off with it.

808
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,460
In the river of history,

809
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,660
time goes round and round.

810
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,020
Memories about the former and present lives

811
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,900
join each other in an endless way.

812
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,500
In the long drunken Milky Way,

813
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,220
one season follows another in a flash,

814
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,420
and the wild geese are flying south.

815
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,340
I just can't give up

816
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,340
to be with you for my whole life.

817
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,620
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

818
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

819
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,300
Year after year in the wandering,

820
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,860
I count the remaining years.

821
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,060
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

822
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,620
even though we have ended up the destiny,

823
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,300
I never feel regretful.

824
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,260
In such a chaotic world,

825
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,020
I still miss you as ever.

826
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,660
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

827
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,380
With a gentle heart,

828
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,940
I cherish our remaining years.

829
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,780
Even though we have to go through

830
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,740
all the hardships along the journey,

831
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:24,060
you always stay by my side,

832
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,820
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

833
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,740
Year after year in the wandering,

834
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,100
I count the remaining years.

835
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,460
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

836
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,260
even though we end up the destiny,

837
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,700
I never feel regretful.

838
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,620
In such a chaotic world,

839
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,580
I still miss you as ever.

840
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,260
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

841
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,020
With a gentle heart,

842
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,420
I cherish our remaining years.

843
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,220
Even though we have to go through

844
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,380
all the hardships along the journey,

845
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:04,660
you always stay by my side...
