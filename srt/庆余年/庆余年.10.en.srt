1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 10

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,400
"It's the Investigator's Office that

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,830
asked Teng Zijing to pretend to be killed.

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,040
I knew that,

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,230
so it's not an offense.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,550
=Eunuch Hou, private servant of Emperor Qing=
It's the Imperial Magistrate's duty to try a case.

21
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,760
The members of the royal family should go back

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,190
and mind your own business."

23
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,440
Your subject obeys.

24
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,360
Your Highness.

25
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,600
May I

26
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,080
take the liberty

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,750
to ask you a question?

28
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,390
Speak.

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,550
Do you know that

30
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,320
I was assassinated in Danzhou not long ago?

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,190
Your Excellency.

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,880
Here I am.

33
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,190
His Majesty ordered you to meet him in the palace.

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
Now... now?

35
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,670
Well, are you not available?

36
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,670
No no no. I don't dare.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,550
I will obey the order.

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,440
Then follow me.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,030
As you wish.

40
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,320
Please wait, Eunuch Hou.

41
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,390
Do you have something to say?

42
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,910
What about us?

43
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,080
The judge has already left.

44
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,960
Now you should go back home

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,550
and mind your own business.

46
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,720
The capital city is not big,

47
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,880
we will meet some day.

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,800
Please rise.

49
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll take you back.

50
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,670
Mr. Fan, you have a promising future,

51
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,720
I don't dare to destroy it.

52
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,440
Let's gather at the Joy Tsin House the other day.

53
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,920
Who on earth are you?

54
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,350
I won't ask you about your background.

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,480
Then I won't tell anyone

56
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,640
you once went out.

57
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,550
All I remember is

58
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,230
one night with you on my bed.

59
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,670
Let's go out first.

60
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,320
Sir.

61
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,880
I can't help it.

62
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,670
The case

63
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,350
is closed.

64
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,100
=Prefecture of Capital City=

65
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,270
Did the Investigator's Office ask you to play dead?

66
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,320
Of course not.

67
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,440
Then why did His Majesty

68
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,390
give the order?

69
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,880
I have no idea.

70
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,390
Could it be that His Majesty appreciates you

71
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,440
and wants to get you out of the trouble?

72
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,480
I have been here for just a few days

73
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
and I haven't even seen His Majesty.

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,350
What does he appreciate me for?

75
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,440
It's so weird.

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,600
Anyway,

77
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,880
you come back to life again

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,950
and can show up in public

79
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,040
from today on.

80
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,160
What's your plan?

81
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,480
That's true.

82
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,510
Don't talk about me.

83
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,550
Go back home now and let your families know you are safe.

84
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,760
If you have time,

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
welcome to my house.

86
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,950
Alright.

87
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,110
Fan Xian.

88
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,200
Fan Xian.

89
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,390
I will be waiting for you at home.

90
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,640
What's wrong?

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,790
I heard that His Majesty sent people here.

92
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,830
It matches you well.

93
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,720
Am I impressive?

94
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,880
Boss.

95
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,830
Has Young Master Guo come here today?

96
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,350
You don't know that?

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,510
I heard that Young Master Guo

98
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,640
was beaten last night

99
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,350
and severely injured.

100
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,950
Guo Baokun was beaten?

101
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,510
What about his servant?

102
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,640
Was he injured?

103
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,790
Young Master Guo only takes hatchet men with him

104
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,390
when he goes out.

105
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,790
He never takes a servant with him.

106
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,790
Are you sure?

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,230
Young Master Guo is

108
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,550
one of our regulars here.

109
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,880
I've never seen him

110
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,670
take a servant with him.

111
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,830
Did Wan'er make a mistake?

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
I wonder Young Master Fan

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,880
who beat him

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,830
would admit his crime or not.

115
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,790
What are you saying?

116
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,390
Who did it?

117
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,720
Boss. Boss.

118
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,320
The case is closed.

119
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
What crime has the Imperial Magistrate

120
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,640
sentenced against Young Master Fan Xian?

121
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,040
He is not guilty.

122
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,760
Si Lili from the Joy Tsin House

123
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,670
testified for him on the court.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,510
She said that Young Master Fan

125
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,600
slept at the Joy Tsin House that night.

126
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,790
So he couldn't

127
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,720
beat Guo Baokun.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Say that again!

129
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,390
Hey, kid.

130
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,070
Could I ask you something?

131
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,790
Is there a village not far away?

132
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,830
I've been here once at night,

133
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
but I almost forget it.

134
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,600
Thank you.

135
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,160
So delicious.

136
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,640
Kid.

137
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,000
Gimme your candied haws. Let me check it out.

138
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,710
Give it back!

139
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,880
Give it back!

140
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,590
Give it back!

141
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,520
It was mixed with little poison,

142
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,640
so he will only suffer from diarrhea.

143
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,000
Wait.

144
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,550
Tell me

145
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,710
who gave you this string of candied haws?

146
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,400
Don't look at me that way.

147
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,230
How about this? I give you the money.

148
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,350
And you give me this string of candied haws, okay?

149
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,710
Anyway, it tastes good.

150
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,790
You didn't go back?

151
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,790
I ask Fan Sizhe to go back.

152
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,230
Sit.

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,440
You make it for your son?

154
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,670
Boys

155
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,670
like this kind of stuffs.

156
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,640
Good. It's so delicate.

157
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,400
He has never seen me before

158
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,280
let alone call me dad.

159
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,350
Maybe it is because

160
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,520
you were not home for years.

161
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,470
I owe him.

162
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,030
Things will be better.

163
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,230
And you don't need to hide in the future.

164
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,910
Even His Majesty knows you are still alive.

165
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,110
Did you say you want to leave the capital city?

166
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,470
You can get prepared for it now.

167
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,030
Where could I go?

168
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,350
Just figure it out yourself.

169
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,640
If you make the decision, just tell me.

170
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,790
I will prepare a carriage for you.

171
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,550
The capital city is not a safe place.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,350
It's good for you to leave here earlier.

173
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,520
Or your families

174
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,670
will always worry about you.

175
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,110
What about you?

176
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,640
My Lady Drumstick is in the capital city.

177
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,280
I don't want to leave now.

178
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,280
Well, you haven't told me

179
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,230
why you asked me here?

180
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,760
You haven't met my families, have you?

181
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,640
I came here in a rush

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and didn't prepare any gifts for them.

183
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,200
No need.

184
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,640
Honey.

185
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Fan Xian is here.

186
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,000
Greetings to you, Your Excellency.

187
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Please don't be so polite.

188
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,840
According to the seniority,

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,110
I should call you sister-in-law.

190
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,350
You have a noble identity.

191
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,710
I don't dare to accept that.

192
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,960
At the gate of the Investigator's Office,

193
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,840
there is a stele,

194
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,520
inscribing that men are created equal

195
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,440
and there is neither lowliness nor nobleness.

196
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,590
Where is our son?

197
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,230
He came back just now.

198
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,520
Come here. we have a guest.

199
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,550
Say hello to our guest.

200
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,910
Sword.

201
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,470
I made it for you. Do you like it?

202
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,880
Yes, I do.

203
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,030
Alright. Don't play the sword.

204
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,440
Come here. Call him uncle.

205
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,110
This uncle is so weird.

206
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,790
He took my candied haws.

207
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,030
Your Majesty. Mei Zhili has arrived.

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,470
Bring him here.

209
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,910
Your Majesty.

210
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,710
Sit.

211
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
=Mei Zhili, Imperial Magistrate of Prefecture of Capital City=

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,030
I don't dare. I am terrified.

213
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
Obedience is better than politeness.

214
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,320
Sit.

215
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,710
Well.

216
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,320
This is not the front hall.

217
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,000
I ask you to have a seat. Then just sit down.

218
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
Gratitude, Your Majesty.

219
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,790
You like drinking mud honey?

220
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,030
Your Majesty, you are so kind to me.

221
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,230
I feel so grateful.

222
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,150
Today let's ignore who we are.

223
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,030
We are just friends.

224
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,790
Have a seat.

225
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,760
I still remember the time when we first met,

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
especially when I was the crown price.

227
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,080
You also have greying temples.

228
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,400
One year ends and another begins. Nobody could avoid it.

229
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,960
You have been working so hard. Thank you.

230
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,000
Your Majesty, it's my job.

231
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,760
That year, I was not in an important position.

232
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,150
If not Your Majesty trusted me,

233
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,910
I won't make it today.

234
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,710
Do you still remember it?

235
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,590
I remember it.

236
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,030
When Your Majesty ascended the throne,

237
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,030
people all said the Imperial Magistrate

238
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,550
took charge of all affairs in the capital city.

239
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,200
And the position is always taken by
offsprings of the royal family.

240
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,960
If you didn't hold your own opinion against the others

241
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,080
and ordered me to

242
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,320
take such an important position,

243
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,150
if I don't make painstaking efforts,

244
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,710
I will feel sorry for your trust.

245
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,350
These years,

246
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,790
I have been always driven by it to do my job.

247
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,710
It keeps me on my toes.

248
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,470
Many memories arise as if it were yesterday.

249
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,710
I always think about that

250
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,400
since we have such a connection,

251
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,840
we should have a good ending.

252
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,350
What a pity!

253
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,320
We always get the opposite of what we want.

254
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,350
Your Majesty. I confess.

255
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,400
We're just chatting.

256
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,840
Why do you confess?

257
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
What do you confess for?

258
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,080
I...

259
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,230
I shouldn't interrogate Fan Xian.

260
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
You received the written complaint.

261
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,000
As the Imperial Magistrate,

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,280
you should do your job.

263
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,350
When the Crown Prince visited the court,

264
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,470
I disobeyed the criminal law and got confused.

265
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,840
The Crown Prince visited the court.

266
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,910
You didn't know how to deal with it. I understand.

267
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,640
When you took the position that year,

268
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,400
you wrote

269
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,440
in your first memorial that

270
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,550
the most important thing to be an official was

271
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,080
loyalty.

272
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,150
Your Majesty.

273
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,320
I might be incompetent,

274
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,230
but my loyalty to Your Majesty

275
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,840
is so obvious that everyone could tell.

276
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Mei Zhili.

277
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,030
I heard that you know

278
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,840
how to predict fate through physiognomy.

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,760
No.

280
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,960
Come.

281
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,790
Have a look at me.

282
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,550
I... Well.

283
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
I...

284
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,590
Tell me if my time is up or not.

285
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,520
Your Majesty, why do you say these words?

286
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,960
If I die,

287
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,760
you still have time to choose the Crown Prince.

288
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,280
No.

289
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,110
As a minister to three kings,

290
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,110
you will get a good fame.

291
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,280
Your Majesty.

292
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,470
I've contributed my sincere heart to you.

293
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,230
It never happened.

294
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,640
Sincere heart?

295
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,000
When the Crown Prince wanted to catch Teng Zijing,

296
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,350
did you ask the Inspector

297
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,760
to investigate his whereabouts?

298
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,280
Did you order people to arrest him?

299
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,550
If not,

300
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,440
well, it's me who was convinced by the rumors.

301
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,760
I should say sorry to you.

302
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,910
Your Majesty.

303
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,550
I confess. I am guilty.

304
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,840
If you punish me by the law, I will never complain.

305
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,150
You are a senior official,

306
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,440
if I punish you by law,

307
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,640
you may think I am cold-hearted.

308
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,440
I understand.

309
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,030
What do you understand?

310
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,080
When I come back home today,

311
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,640
I may probably fall into a well by accident.

312
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,910
But my families

313
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,080
know nothing about the case,

314
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,080
I beg you to show some mercy.

315
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,150
Alright.

316
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,470
You haven't drunk the mud honey.

317
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,710
Your...

318
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,110
Don't be terrified.

319
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,800
I will have a cup of mud honey with you.

320
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,950
Mei Zhili.

321
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,000
For old time's sake,

322
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,470
don't jump into a well after you go back home.

323
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
Write a memorial to apply for

324
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,950
resigning from office and returning to your hometown.

325
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,400
Don't get up too early tomorrow morning.

326
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,000
I promise you can return to your hometown with honor

327
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,110
and lead a peaceful life in the future.

328
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,230
Thanks for your kindness, Your Majesty.

329
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,470
It is now too late to repent.

330
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,640
I wish you can keep healthy.

331
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,190
Please take care of yourself.

332
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,520
Ask the Investigator's Office

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,070
to keep an eye on Mei Zhili,

334
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,950
and kill him on his way to his hometown

335
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,310
as a bandit.

336
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

337
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
In the hall today,

338
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,880
what Fan Xian did has been known

339
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,560
by all people in the capital city.

340
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,710
I've heard about that.

341
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,520
He wrote the line A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

342
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,520
he beat someone on the street

343
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,950
and a famous prostitute even suffers calamities because of him.

344
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,310
It's extraordinarily bustling.

345
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,280
Fan Xian is really good at poetizing.

346
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,830
But he is

347
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,280
too arrogant and rude.

348
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,230
Now everyone knows that

349
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,190
Fan Xian indulges in dallying with prostitutes

350
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,710
and beat people on the street.

351
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,880
If Wan'er marries him,

352
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,310
I'm afraid that

353
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,800
he will bring shame on the imperial family.

354
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,160
Do you still want to turn down the marriage?

355
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,070
He doesn't realize he is just a subject

356
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,350
and doesn't show any respect

357
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,880
to the Crown Prince in the court.

358
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,000
If he takes over

359
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,920
the Neiku in the future,

360
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,710
I'm afraid there will hidden troubles.

361
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,310
I am tired. You should leave now.

362
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,950
She never wants

363
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,350
to marry Wan'er to Fan Xian.

364
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,830
But what she said

365
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,350
makes sense.

366
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,710
Fan Xian's reputation

367
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,040
is really not that good.

368
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm afraid

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,950
the marriage is improper.

370
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,400
Your Majesty could issue a decree

371
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,430
to break off the engagement.

372
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,430
I will leave it to the emperor.

373
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,680
How dare you

374
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,000
ask High Highness about the assassination

375
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,280
in front of so many people?

376
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,640
I wanted to know it, then I asked.

377
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
But he said nothing.

378
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,400
As for the girl named Si Lili

379
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,950
who has suffered the cruel torture for you,

380
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,470
everyone is gossiping about

381
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,950
your personal relationship now.

382
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,110
She suffered the cruel torture

383
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,040
not for me.

384
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,680
Miss. A few young men

385
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,760
have been attracted here by your reputation.

386
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,880
They are waiting outside

387
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,920
and want to appreciate your graceful bearing.

388
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,830
By virtue of the cruel torture,

389
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,000
I won the reputation.

390
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,190
From today on,

391
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,000
I have settled down

392
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,160
in the capital city.

393
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,470
It's

394
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,230
worth it.

395
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,350
You wanted to punish Guo Baokun.

396
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,350
Fine, it's okay.

397
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,160
But you leaked your whereabouts

398
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
and even asked the girl from the Joy Tsin House

399
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,640
to be your witness in advance.

400
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,230
You've done all these things

401
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,430
because you want to tell all people that

402
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,520
you are lust for women and arrogant.

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,760
You're right.

404
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,710
Why?

405
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,470
I want to break off the engagement.

406
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,350
You don't want to marry Lin Wan'er?

407
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,880
I've told you about the Lady Drumstick.

408
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,710
If only you marry Lin Wan'er,

409
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,920
you could take the Neiku back.

410
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,280
It's not easy to meet a girl I like.

411
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Neiku is

412
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,590
your mother's property.

413
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,520
I think

414
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
she would prefer to see me living a happy life.

415
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,280
Did you say you want to leave the capital city?

416
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,760
You can get prepared for it now.

417
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,070
Where could I go for?

418
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,560
Just figure it out yourself.

419
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
If you make the decision, just tell me.

420
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,400
I will prepare a carriage for you.

421
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,000
The capital city is not a safe place.

422
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,310
It's good for you to leave here earlier.

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,070
Or your families

424
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,520
will always worry about you.

425
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,560
Have you packed our luggage up?

426
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,710
We will leave here tomorrow.

427
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,470
Where are we going?

428
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,070
In such a big world,

429
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,680
we can go everywhere.

430
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,880
It's better than staying in the capital city.

431
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,400
It's been so many years.

432
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,000
I have always wanted to leave

433
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,040
and kept thinking about it.

434
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,830
Till now,

435
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,710
my wish is fulfilled.

436
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,350
But it seems like you are not happy.

437
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,190
Go.

438
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,350
To where?

439
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,230
To meet him.

440
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,280
No matter what decision you will make,

441
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,590
we will always be with you.

442
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
Ling'er, you can't cheat me.

443
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's absolutely true.

444
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,430
Guo Baokun has no servant.

445
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,430
How could it be like this?

446
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,830
You are still in the mood of caring about his servant.

447
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,710
Do you know

448
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,470
how people gossip Fan Xian now?

449
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,070
Last time he hid a girl singer in the carriage

450
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,640
and this time he was in a tangle with Si Lili

451
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,950
from the Joy Tsin House.

452
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,590
You are a princess,

453
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,520
how can you marry such a disgraceful man?

454
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Please rest assured.

455
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,400
I will help you to break off the engagement.

456
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,230
It's getting late.

457
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,350
You'd better go to bed now.

458
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,800
I will see you tomorrow.

459
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,430
If you are not the servant,

460
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,520
who else are you?

461
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,310
I heard that Wan'er came here

462
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,280
and wanted to break off the engagement.

463
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,400
But Fan Xian has bad manners.

464
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,680
She hasn't seen him.

465
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,710
I think

466
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,640
she must hate to marry with him.

467
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,230
But Her Majesty

468
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,400
hasn't agreed her with that yet.

469
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,950
They just care about the state affairs.

470
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,400
Nobody cares about what's on Wan'er's mind.

471
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,950
Her Highness ordered us not to gossip.

472
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,920
You'd better go out of the palace

473
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,710
and pass on a message for me.

474
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,000
Break off the engagement?

475
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,160
Yes.

476
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,310
Her Highness said

477
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,800
this marriage

478
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,470
is not what she wishes.

479
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,920
Now she knows Fan Xian is so ridiculous,

480
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
she hates him much more.

481
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,040
Although His Majesty and Her Majesty

482
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,160
haven't agreed her with that,

483
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,310
Her Highness will manage to find a way out

484
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,040
and asks you not to worry about it.

485
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,590
Her Highness will help you to break off the engagement

486
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,350
and never marry you to a man you don't like.

487
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,400
Then I should thank him to his face.

488
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,470
Her Highness said

489
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,590
you should recuperate at home.

490
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,430
You don't need to visit her.

491
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,800
Please send my regards to mother.

492
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,350
I will.

493
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,590
What's more, Her Highness asked

494
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,950
if you have anyone in mind?

495
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,760
No, I...

496
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't have anyone in mind.

497
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,710
Then I will reply Her Highness as you said.

498
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,280
Well.

499
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,230
Well, if we break off the engagement,

500
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,830
can I marry anyone I like regardless of his status?

501
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,160
Her Highness said that

502
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,880
if you really like him,

503
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,950
it doesn't matter who he is.

504
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,680
Well, what if he is just a servant?

505
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,000
That's okay.

506
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,470
A servant?

507
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,830
I am just off the top of my head.

508
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,830
I don't mean anybody.

509
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,920
A servant?

510
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,190
Whose servant is he?

511
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,680
It's weird.

512
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Her Highness has been recuperating at home for years,

513
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,110
she has few chances to make friends.

514
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,680
Even if she has some friends,

515
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,710
they are all girls.

516
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,800
It's impossible for her

517
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,190
to encounter some servant.

518
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,560
Go check it out

519
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,280
whose servant

520
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,640
has met Her Highness.

521
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,230
And then

522
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,400
check out which kind of people he is and his background.

523
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,110
Then we can talk about the other things.

524
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,950
I will.

525
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Uncle Wuzhu.

526
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,560
Are you really completely

527
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,760
disappeared from then on?

528
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,430
So many things have happened recently.

529
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,950
When I have to make a choice,

530
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,400
I don't know whether it's right or wrong.

531
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,070
If you were me,

532
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,070
what will you choose to do?

533
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,560
It's so late. Why are you here?

534
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,590
Why did you

535
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,640
take my son's candied haws away?

536
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,280
I have explained it to you.

537
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,280
I took it away

538
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,160
because I knew

539
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,880
he was poisoned.

540
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,310
I did it for your son's sake.

541
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,590
But you bit it.

542
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,070
Because I wanted to check it out.

543
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,000
I think you are a fool.

544
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,190
Do you have to taste it for that?

545
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,280
What if you die because of it?

546
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,800
I won't die because of that.

547
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm Fei Jie's student.

548
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,350
You were so stupid that

549
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,470
you even

550
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,310
questioned His Highness on the court.

551
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,710
I just wanted to know the truth.

552
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,880
What can you do if you know it?

553
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,680
I haven't figured it out yet.

554
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,880
So I think you are a fool.

555
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,520
Do you think

556
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,590
you are under the cover of the Second Prince

557
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,830
and the Crown Prince doesn't dare to hurt you?

558
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,230
I am not on the Second Prince's side.

559
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,680
Then you can't be more stupid.

560
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,950
You don't even have a shelter.

561
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,000
Why are you so arrogant?

562
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,280
Bro.

563
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,880
You come to my house so late

564
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,520
just for scolding me?

565
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,000
I

566
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,110
will stay.

567
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,190
What? You won't leave the capital city?

568
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,430
You are so stupid. If I leave here,

569
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm afraid you can't survive

570
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,560
by yourself.

571
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,110
You always say that

572
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,760
you want to leave the capital city, don't you?

573
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,110
Fifty taels.

574
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,830
What?

575
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,520
You give me fifty taels of silver

576
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,560
every month.

577
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,590
No arrears.

578
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,560
My son is at the school age.

579
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,280
You should find him the best teacher

580
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,640
through your relationship with the Fan family.

581
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,830
Moreover,

582
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
you should give me

583
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,640
two acres of fertilized land

584
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,800
and an ox.

585
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,760
In the following days,

586
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,280
the Crown Prince may attack me at any time.

587
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,640
Because of your stupid behavior.

588
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,640
You stay here at the time

589
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,710
to be my guard.

590
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,310
Silver, land and ox.

591
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,070
I want all of them.

592
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,310
Have you made up your mind?

593
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,830
The capital city is not a safe place.

594
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,680
No bargaining.

595
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,280
Fine. Deal.

596
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,880
What are you doing? Get up.

597
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,640
By the way,

598
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,400
do you know

599
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,230
who poisoned your son?

600
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,430
It's me.

601
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,400
You?

602
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,350
Yeah.

603
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,640
He likes candies.

604
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,470
I'm afraid his teeth will decay,

605
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,760
so I poison him.

606
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,920
If he eats too many candies,

607
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,950
he will suffer from stomachache.

608
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,280
Then I can control the intake.

609
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,040
You even poison your own son

610
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,640
because of this?

611
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,190
I can't scare him with a knife.

612
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,110
How can you behave like this as a dad?

613
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,190
I am a new dad.

614
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,590
I have to learn how to be a dad.

615
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,710
Your son is so tough.

616
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,800
My son is happy.

617
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,640
He likes the wooden knife I made for him.

618
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,230
I still want to make him

619
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,000
a wooden sword, a wooden bow and a wooden dart.

620
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,560
Please tell me

621
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,800
which one I should make first.

622
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,230
Can you make him

623
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,040
a wooden horse?

624
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,830
Then I will make him a wooden lance.

625
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,230
He is not a cavalry.

626
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,920
He is just a kid.

627
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,800
Just make him a wooden horse for kids.

628
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,640
Why do you always give people

629
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,800
such an ill feeling?

630
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,000
If you want to get along with kids,

631
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,640
the most important thing is

632
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,000
to keep the childlike innocence

633
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,040
and behave in a naive way.

634
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,640
Then you can

635
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,470
get close to him.

636
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,160
Do you understand?

637
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,040
Then why did you

638
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,430
take my son's candied haws away?

639
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,920
I said I didn't do that.

640
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,430
But you bit it.

641
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,590
I wanted to check out whether it was poisoned or not.

642
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,880
I think you are stupid.

643
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,640
I will not die because of that.

644
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,760
You are really stupid.

645
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,470
Fine. I am stupid.

646
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,040
Your Majesty.

647
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,800
Her Majesty sent people here

648
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,070
to ask you to go to sleep early.

649
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,430
What else did Her Majesty say?

650
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,400
She said Fan Xian

651
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,350
disrespected the Crown Prince on the court.

652
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,110
She didn't say it in a direct way,

653
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,230
but I'm afraid, Your Majesty,

654
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,800
that you should think over the marriage of Her Highness.

655
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,680
After all, it's an imperial marriage,

656
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,190
Your Majesty, you should be cautious.

657
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,590
If he showed respects to the Crown Prince,

658
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,680
he would be

659
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,640
the same as Mei Zhili.

660
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,310
Tell me, how close he has got

661
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,680
to the Second Prince?

662
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,000
The Second Prince

663
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,310
showed up on the court today,

664
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,640
but I still think His Highness went there on purpose.

665
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,830
In this way,

666
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,760
the Crown Prince may think that

667
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,190
Fan Xian has been on the side of the Second Prince.

668
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,830
In such a hurry and confusion,

669
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,000
the Crown Prince may take action.

670
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,950
At that time, he will be caught tripping

671
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,430
by the Second Prince.

672
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,190
My sons

673
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,640
are really hard to deal with.

674
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,280
His Highnesses are detail-minded.

675
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,190
They are the best of the best.

676
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,000
Do you think they can cheat on each other?

677
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,230
I don't dare to tell.

678
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,640
It's not finished yet.

679
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,710
Sit on our hands. Let them play.

680
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,830
Eunuch Hou.

681
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,520
I'm here.

682
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,520
You have

683
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,950
talked too much recently.

684
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
It's so early.

685
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,670
What's the rush?

686
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,080
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

687
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
I have been waiting here early in the morning

688
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,870
for fear of bothering you.

689
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,670
Her Highness asked me to tell you that

690
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,150
His Excellency Mei asked for reassignment
because of illness yesterday.

691
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,080
On his way to the hometown,

692
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,360
he has been murdered as a bandit.

693
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,190
Her Highness thinks that

694
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
it must be His Majesty's order...

695
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,120
It's my fault.

696
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,910
I was in such a rush to declare Fan Xian's guilty

697
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,280
but got Mei Zhili involved in it.

698
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,040
Her Highness also said that

699
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,630
Fan Xian may have been

700
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,870
on the side of the Second Prince.

701
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,630
Before long,

702
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,080
he would be a throne in your flesh

703
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,000
for Your Highness.

704
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,800
I don't think so.

705
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,520
I know him well.

706
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,760
If Fan Xian is on his side,

707
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,630
he would not show up himself.

708
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,950
If he has to show up himself,

709
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,870
it proves that Fan Xian

710
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,600
isn't on his side.

711
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,670
Her Highness thought

712
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,950
even so,

713
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,870
you can't just let Fan Xian

714
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,430
take over the property ownership.

715
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,670
Go back and tell Auntie that

716
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,950
for the time being,

717
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,840
His Majesty transferred Fan Xian to the post,

718
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,470
I'm afraid he must take him as the bait,

719
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,630
if you want to attack Fan Xian again,

720
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,390
you must kill him with one shot

721
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,670
and never get the official force involved.

722
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,280
We can't take actions in such a hurry.

723
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,390
Let me think it over.

724
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,600
Why are you here again?

725
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,870
Fan Xian told me that you are going to leave.

726
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,390
I have made a deal with him

727
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,630
and then I come back.

728
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,520
Where is he?

729
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,390
He is with my dad?

730
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,080
What happened in the early morning?

731
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,520
I don't know.

732
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,670
Fine.

733
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,630
I have a question.

734
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,190
How much money

735
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,710
does Fan Xian pay you every month?

736
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,430
What are you saying?

737
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,390
Haven't I made it clear enough?

738
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,470
No. I've heard what you are saying

739
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,760
but I can't understand.

740
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,870
What do you mean by Lin Wan'er and I

741
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,630
are still engaged!

742
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,470
I mean

743
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,600
you will marry her.

744
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,000
Well. I have messed it up like that.

745
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,910
Why didn't they break off the engagement?

746
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,000
It's said that the imperial harem is not satisfied with you

747
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,120
and even Her Majesty dislikes you.

748
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,630
That's what I want.

749
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,840
But why didn't they cancel the engagement?

750
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,710
His Majesty ordered that

751
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,230
you are still going to get married.

752
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,670
Well, I...

753
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,710
Let me figure out the relations.

754
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,040
The Princess Royal is His Majesty's younger sister.

755
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,670
Lin Wan'er is the Princess Royal's daughter.

756
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,760
Lin Wan'er has no blood relation with
His Majesty, but she is a princess.

757
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,800
That is to say,

758
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,120
His Majesty is

759
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,800
Lin Wan'er's uncle.

760
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,520
You're right.

761
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
Father.

762
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,190
There is nobody else here.

763
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,430
Please tell me the truth.

764
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,430
About what?

765
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,280
Tell me whether

766
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,470
His Majesty is out of mind or not.

767
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,230
How dare you!

768
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,150
I have a bad reputation now,

769
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,150
why does he force

770
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,120
his sister's daughter

771
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,840
to marry me?

772
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,870
His Majesty must have his own intentions.

773
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,470
Then what about My Lady Drumstick?

774
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,560
Just forget her.

775
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,120
He really will pay you 50 taels?

776
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,280
Fan Xian.

777
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,670
You pay him 50 taels

778
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,950
every month.

779
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,800
Why do you ask about this?

780
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,520
You even bought him

781
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,760
land and ox.

782
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,040
I don't even

783
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,080
get 50 taels per month.

784
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,190
Well brother,

785
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,560
how about this?

786
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,150
I will exchange my identity with him.

787
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,280
I want to be your guard.

788
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,320
Cut the crap!

789
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,190
I'm looking for you.

790
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,000
Take Ruoruo along.

791
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,840
You will go out with me.

792
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,600
What are you going to do?

793
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,320
Take my wife back.

794
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,040
If you pay me 50 taels,

795
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,230
I will think about it.

796
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,600
Sister.

797
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,910
You go out with me

798
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,840
without asking where we are going?

799
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,040
Why should I?

800
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,280
We should know what we are going to do, shouldn't we?

801
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,190
Brother has his plan.

802
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,670
If he plans to sell you,

803
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,710
will you go with him?

804
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,710
He must have his reasons if he does so.

805
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,120
Fan Xian.

806
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,600
What on earth

807
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,280
have you done to my sister?

808
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,000
My sister is

809
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,360
the first talented girl in the capital city.

810
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,230
Why does she behave like a silly girl

811
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,320
in front of you?

812
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,150
I should have told you what to do.

813
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,360
Ruoruo. You are a girl.

814
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,670
A little while later,

815
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,670
when you see your sister-in-law, just take her away.

816
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,870
Sister-in-law?

817
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,710
If I marry My Lady Drumstick,

818
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,150
then they won't force me to get married with Lin Wan'er.

819
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,390
Brother, where are we going?

820
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,080
Prince Jing's mansion.

821
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,800
It's lucky that I know

822
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,080
she is a servant girl of Prince Jing.

823
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,360
Your Highness, Fan Xian asks to see you.

824
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,600
Let him in.

825
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,560
As you wish.

826
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,000
Fan.

827
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,520
Why are you here today?

828
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
I want you to help me with one thing.

829
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,520
What is it?

830
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,230
I want to see the girls in your house.

831
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,040
Which one?

832
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,800
All of them.

833
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,520
Well.

834
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,190
Once I tell you whom she is,

835
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,630
Ruoruo, you go and grab her.

836
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,360
If I do it,

837
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,230
I'm afraid it's a little rude.

838
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,670
Please rest assured.

839
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,630
You will never be ruder.

840
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,150
Your Highness, I will get started.

841
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,320
Come and line up.

842
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,520
One by one.

843
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,760
Come here.

844
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,870
Do you want this one?

845
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,230
This one?

846
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,710
Next. Next.

847
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,600
Next one.

848
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,520
I think this girl is good, brother.

849
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,230
Come one, next one.

850
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,120
Next one.

851
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,360
Come. You can go.

852
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,430
Next one. Next one.

853
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Do you live here?

854
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,600
Are you married?

855
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,670
No.

856
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,840
What's your name?

857
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,120
Okay. Next one.

858
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,120
Actually, this one is okay.

859
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,910
It must be her.

860
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,120
You haven't found her out?

861
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,280
It's okay.

862
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,710
Just wait.

863
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,280
The next batch. Come on.

864
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,760
You are really picky.

865
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,080
Go. Go. Go.

866
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,470
Don't be afraid. Go. Hurry.

867
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,600
Is it her?

868
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,280
Fine. It's not her.

869
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,000
Go. Go. Go.

870
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,150
My brother doesn't want to see you.

871
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,950
Come.

872
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,080
Haven't you found her?

873
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,040
Don't worry.

874
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,360
Brother, we still have another batch.

875
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,950
The next batch. Come.

876
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,120
They are all here?

877
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,430
Yes.

878
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,230
That's impossible.

879
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,520
I saw her on the poetry gathering.

880
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,630
That day,

881
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,280
there were many guests.

882
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,040
The maidservant you're looking for

883
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,150
might not be from my mansion.

884
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,630
If so,

885
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,950
it won't be easy to find her.

886
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,430
What if I visit all the families

887
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,470
one by one?

888
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,710
I'm afraid you'll probably be kicked out.

889
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,740
In the river of history,

890
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,940
time goes round and round.

891
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,300
Memories about the former and present lives

892
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,180
join each other in an endless way.

893
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,780
In the long drunken Milky Way,

894
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,500
one season follows another in a flash,

895
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,700
and the wild geese are flying south.

896
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,620
I just can't give up

897
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,620
to be with you for my whole life.

898
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,900
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

899
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,700
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

900
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,580
Year after year in the wandering,

901
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,140
I count the remaining years.

902
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,340
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

903
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,900
even though we have ended up the destiny,

904
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,580
I never feel regretful.

905
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,540
In such a chaotic world,

906
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,300
I still miss you as ever.

907
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,940
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

908
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,660
With a gentle heart,

909
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,220
I cherish our remaining years.

910
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,060
Even though we have to go through

911
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,020
all the hardships along the journey,

912
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:23,340
you always stay by my side,

913
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,100
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

914
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,020
Year after year in the wandering,

915
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,380
I count the remaining years.

916
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,740
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

917
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,540
even though we end up the destiny,

918
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,980
I never feel regretful.

919
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,900
In such a chaotic world,

920
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,860
I still miss you as ever.

921
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,540
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

922
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,300
With a gentle heart,

923
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,700
I cherish our remaining years.

924
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,500
Even though we have to go through

925
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,660
all the hardships along the journey,

926
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:03,940
you always stay by my side...
