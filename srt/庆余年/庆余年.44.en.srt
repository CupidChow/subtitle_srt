00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,120
(It's My Life)

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,620
In fact,

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,190
I was so foolish to believe you could have sincere feelings.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,800
What's the point of being highly educated, rich, and smart?

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,399
You have a frozen heart.

8
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,170
Don't blab away like that when you know nothing about me.

9
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,210
You know nothing about me.

10
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:44,679
Right.

11
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,990
I don't really know what kind of relationship you and Jin Ah have...

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,350
and what happened between you two.

13
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:53,920
But I know this much.

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,829
If you're a man,

15
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,130
you should never make a woman cry.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,700
Jin Ah said...

17
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,969
she really wanted to introduce you to her father.

18
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,859
The feelings you're talking about are just like that.

19
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,459
Just like junk food, it looks good and tastes sweet.

20
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,799
It's tempting.

21
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,730
But it always harms your health in the end.

22
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,150
- Man Seok. - Yes?

23
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,980
I'm hungry, Man Seok.

24
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,890
My gosh, you're hungry?

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,230
I put your breakfast away. Do you want to have it now?

26
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,329
I don't want hospital food.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,129
What about the porridge and seaweed soup Seung Joo brought?

28
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,260
Is there any left?

29
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,800
Well, there isn't any.

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,569
Didn't Seon Gyu finish them?

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,370
I'm the one who's hospitalized. Why did he eat them all?

32
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,939
Wait a few minutes. Seung Joo will be here soon.

33
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,280
I'll step out and see. Have a seat here.

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,990
Oh, Seung Joo must've stopped by already.

35
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,060
- My gosh. - What?

36
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,729
- Dad. - Yes.

37
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,969
Hey, where did you go after leaving the food here?

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,840
Were you afraid that you'd wake me up?

39
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,009
What? Oh, yes.

40
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,139
I had to take a call.

41
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,810
How are you feeling?

42
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,949
She can be discharged now.

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,319
By the way, were you always such a great cook?

44
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,250
Yeon Sil always waits for your food.

45
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,389
What will she do after she gets discharged?

46
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,389
I'll bring food over.

47
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,629
Okay. Thank you, Seung Joo.

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,330
Thanks, Seung Joo.

49
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,900
I'm a picky eater, but you're such a great cook.

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,740
Get better soon.

51
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,900
So what did you bring today?

52
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,509
What?

53
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,639
Well, it's...

54
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,879
You'll find out when you open it. Why ask?

55
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:31,719
Is there enough for me as well?

56
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,849
I'm sure she packed enough food...

57
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,719
I mean, I packed enough food, so you two can eat together.

58
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,360
All right.

59
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,860
Let's see.

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,300
Hold on. Did you really...

61
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,669
make all this?

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,939
What? I did, of course.

63
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,039
Why do you ask?

64
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,610
You don't even know how to prepare abalone.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,349
What? Oh, it's...

66
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,979
Nam Jin's mother made the food.

67
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:08,889
What?

68
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,090
Don't be like this. The food didn't do anything wrong.

69
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,100
You want to eat food made by the woman who made us lose our baby?

70
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,100
Let's just eat it. I'm hungry.

71
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,930
There's no need to take it out on the food.

72
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,100
I don't want to eat this.

73
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,069
Nam Jin's mother has been making breakfast every morning...

74
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,240
because she feels terrible. How could you be so ruthless, Dad?

75
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,910
Just leave it there if you don't want it.

76
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,410
Whose side are you on?

77
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,180
You're my only daughter. How could you be like this?

78
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:44,319
I'm on no one's side.

79
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,019
But this already happened. I don't think it's right...

80
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,160
to hold a grudge and hate the person forever.

81
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,500
And that's why I forgave her brother as well.

82
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,079
Hello? The police?

83
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,750
The police?

84
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,079
Did Seon Gyu get himself in another trouble?

85
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,350
Ms. Yang Sun Ja turned herself in?

86
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,100
Ms. Yang.

87
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,100
Mr. Heo.

88
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,170
What happened?

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,600
This lady?

90
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,709
She turned herself in, saying she had a fight...

91
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,009
with Mr. Han Man Seok's wife, Ms. Ko, and made her miscarry.

92
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,649
I beg your pardon?

93
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,920
A fetus is seen as part of the mother's body,

94
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,180
so if the victim wishes to press charges,

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,990
it can be considered assault,

96
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,019
but the victim doesn't want to press charges against her.

97
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:53,089
In addition,

98
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,029
she didn't know she was pregnant, and both used violence.

99
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,699
So she won't receive any legal punishment.

100
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,629
I see.

101
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,129
No. Detective.

102
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,800
I deserve to go to prison.

103
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,680
Because of me, she lost her precious baby she had at a late age.

104
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,379
How can I walk around without feeling ashamed?

105
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,350
Ms. Yang, I'm sorry about the accident.

106
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,889
But it doesn't seem that you'll receive legal punishment.

107
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,519
No.

108
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,730
Please send me to prison.

109
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,829
By speaking thoughtlessly...

110
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,870
and acting unsophisticated,

111
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,540
I always embarrass my son Nam Jin.

112
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:47,240
Mr. Han won't make Nam Jin's team's clothes...

113
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,009
because of me.

114
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
What do I do, Mr. Heo?

115
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,850
What should I do?

116
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,160
I will talk to Mr. Han.

117
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,290
So let's go.

118
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,600
Ms. Yang, you have already paid for what you did...

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,899
and cleared your guilt.

120
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,040
It's up to them whether to forgive you or not.

121
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,610
So please stand up. Come on.

122
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,110
Let's go. Please stand up.

123
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,949
- Thank you. - No worries.

124
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,319
So Jeong, it's me.

125
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,750
Yes, Si Woo. Where are you?

126
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm at the beauty parlor.

127
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,889
I...

129
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,360
cannot get engaged to you.

130
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,070
What do you mean by that?

131
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:53,740
Si Woo.

132
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,509
I can't...

133
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,679
get engaged to someone else abandoning her.

134
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,850
You see,

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,179
I never...

136
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,690
believed in love.

137
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,559
But...

138
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,529
she made me believe in love.

139
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:22,970
So...

140
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,139
I can't go to you...

141
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,269
with these feelings I have.

142
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,379
This morning,

143
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,879
my violin string snapped.

144
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,350
I guess it was the sign that this would happen.

145
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,559
I thought...

146
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,399
I shouldn't make you wait for me all alone at the venue...

147
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,970
just like the man who never showed up at the airport.

148
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,639
I thought...

149
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,710
I shouldn't do that no matter what.

150
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,379
Can't you reconsider your decision?

151
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,149
No.

152
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,450
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,519
When you...

154
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,100
hold a concert in Korea, I'll make sure to go.

155
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,129
Please play the violin sonata...

156
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,299
for me then.

157
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,139
I will always cheer for your life...

158
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,940
as a violinist.

159
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,970
Why? Do I look weird?

160
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,669
No.

161
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,179
You don't look so bad.

162
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,980
In the town I used to live in,

163
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,450
there was a ballroom dance club called the Garden Tiger Moth.

164
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,620
Whenever I showed up at the club...

165
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,889
and started dancing,

166
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,559
all the housewives who were cooking flew to me...

167
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,159
and got stuck to me like glue.

168
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,700
I see. If you say so.

169
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,600
It's true.

170
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,039
By the way, did Si Woo leave home first?

171
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,340
He said he'd go to the beauty parlor early this morning...

172
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,240
and then go straight to the engagement ceremony.

173
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,340
Oh, my. You look...

174
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,879
even more beautiful today, my angel.

175
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:27,149
How about I'll be a garden tiger moth today...

176
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,350
and fly to you?

177
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,190
Shall I fly to you or not?

178
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,559
I want to fly to you.

179
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,690
Where is Ms. Yang?

180
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,200
I didn't see her this morning. I think she went to a beauty parlor.

181
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,370
Ms. Yang won't be able to go there.

182
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,370
Why?

183
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,740
She went out early this morning saying she had to go somewhere.

184
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,179
She asked me to tell you that she's sorry for her absence.

185
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,480
She had to go somewhere? Where?

186
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,649
She must be sulky because I said something to her yesterday. Gosh.

187
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,250
Never mind.

188
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,350
I invited her to the ceremony,

189
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,990
but she won't attend it. So I'm not to blame, right?

190
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,429
Of course. She's the one who won't attend the ceremony.

191
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,529
Actually, she goes into a sulk quite often.

192
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,799
The worst person in the world is a person who changes sides...

193
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,039
as he likes.

194
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,769
You'll be punished if you forget what Ms. Yang did for you.

195
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,750
Gosh. I change sides as I like?

196
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,649
What do you mean by that?

197
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,620
Shall we go? I'll escort you.

198
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,519
Mr. Jang will pick me up.

199
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,559
Why did you ask him to come?

200
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,220
I can take you there.

201
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,870
Yes, So Jeong. Are you ready?

202
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,769
Mother.

203
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,639
I'm at the airport right now.

204
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,870
Airport?

205
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,539
Why are you at the airport? You'll get engaged in a few hours.

206
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:04,809
Si Woo said he couldn't get engaged to me.

207
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,220
What?

208
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,860
What... What are you talking about?

209
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,590
What do you mean he can't get engaged to you?

210
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,360
You must be mistaken.

211
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,559
Si Woo went to the beauty parlor.

212
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,169
I'm sure you misheard him.

213
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,840
I didn't mishear him.

214
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,669
Si Woo was adamant about his decision.

215
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,879
So Jeong. He must have had his own reasons.

216
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,820
Let's meet up for now.

217
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,419
Let's meet up and talk.

218
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,220
I will leave Korea, and this time,

219
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,090
I won't come back.

220
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,490
Thank you for everything, Mother.

221
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,759
Wait. So Jeong. So Jeong.

222
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,240
Are you ready to go?

223
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,779
- Mr. Jang. - What's wrong?

224
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,820
Try calling Si Woo.

225
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,590
I just talked to him over the phone.

226
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,159
What did he say?

227
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,059
What did Si Woo say?

228
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,889
He didn't say anything special.

229
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,559
He just asked me to take good care of you.

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
Call him again.

231
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:31,970
Again?

232
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,299
Okay. I'll do that.

233
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,679
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

234
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,980
His phone is turned off.

235
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,820
My goodness. Ms. Choi.

236
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,120
Are you all right?

237
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,159
You want me to go there on behalf of the whole team?

238
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,000
That's not fair.

239
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,399
Out of us, you're the closest to her.

240
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,570
Yes, you said you two are roommates.

241
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,299
We can go together after the engagement ceremony.

242
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,309
That will be too late.

243
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,840
And it's unnecessary for all of us to go to that far country town.

244
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,309
You can go on behalf of the team.

245
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,110
We'll be late.

246
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,320
- Let's go. - Okay, let's go.

247
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,879
- Do it for us, okay? Take it easy. - Bye!

248
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,389
Mr. Jo. Ms. Kim.

249
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,919
Yeon Ji.

250
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:30,129
Jin Ah's family is in mourning?

251
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:35,000
Jin Ah's father passed away last night.

252
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,230
Jin Ah's dad?

253
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,840
I should go to the funeral because I'm her roommate,

254
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,009
but we can all go together after the engagement ceremony.

255
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,580
I want to go to Mr. Choi's engagement ceremony too.

256
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,220
I'll go with you.

257
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,620
- You want to go? - Yes.

258
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,389
He was my father-in-law after all,

259
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,490
albeit for a short while.

260
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,200
If you come with me, I won't be bored.

261
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,859
Hello.

262
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,329
I'm 10 minutes late, but don't deduct it from my pay.

263
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,369
Well... Look after the cafe for me.

264
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,769
Are you going somewhere?

265
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,740
I have to go to my hometown as my friend's father passed away.

266
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,910
You'll be back before we close, right?

267
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,509
It'll be hard.

268
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,180
Take care of closing for me as well.

269
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,720
You want me to close up?

270
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,519
I can do it,

271
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,289
but I want two times my hourly wage today. Deal?

272
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,759
Okay. Two... Two times. Deal.

273
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,529
So what? Four times?

274
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:43,529
My dad told me to never tolerate people...

275
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,269
who make fun of my stutter.

276
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,440
All right, fine. Two times, it is.

277
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,769
Have a safe journey, boss.

278
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:52,940
- Just a moment. - Gosh.

279
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,509
(Oepo Funeral Home)

280
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,579
Just a minute.

281
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,750
- Give me some time. - Come on!

282
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,819
Just a moment.

283
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,690
What's with you? Goodness.

284
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,119
What's wrong? Are you scared?

285
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,890
No, not really.

286
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,359
I can't face her family.

287
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,400
You're such a loser.

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,599
Man up and let's go in, okay?

289
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,170
Come on.

290
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,839
- Hello, Ms. Seo. - Hello, Mr. Ahn.

291
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,910
Hey, Nam Jin.

292
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,640
Dae Sik, you're here too.

293
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,079
My gosh, it's that female gangster.

294
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,119
"Female gangster"?

295
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,390
That was Seung Joo?

296
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,220
Yes.

297
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,500
I hope you're not here to bother Jin Ah again.

298
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:48,329
No, of course not.

299
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm here to beg her father for forgiveness.

300
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,539
All right, then beg him sincerely.

301
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,809
Yes, I will. I'll beg on my knees.

302
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,779
I'm glad you came.

303
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,180
You should beg sincerely for forgiveness.

304
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,690
Had I known you were coming, I could've gotten a ride from you.

305
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,359
It was so exhausting to drag Dae Sik all the way here.

306
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,359
Oh, I heard your team members are attending Mr. Choi's...

307
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,059
engagement ceremony. Are you the only one that didn't go?

308
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,029
What can I do? I'm Jin Ah's roommate,

309
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,400
so I should be here.

310
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,400
Let's go in.

311
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,410
Just a second, Yeon Ji.

312
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,809
I'm not mentally ready yet.

313
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:37,009
How long will it take for you to be ready?

314
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,380
Go in first.

315
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,089
Take it easy, Ms. Seo.

316
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,490
We'll head in, then.

317
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,799
- Hold on a minute. - Gosh, you.

318
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,380
Jin Ah.

319
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,250
Mr. Choi.

320
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,670
I should bow to your father first.

321
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,460
I'm sorry...

322
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,029
that I came so late.

323
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,599
I should've met you before you passed away.

324
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,200
I came too late.

325
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,470
I sincerely apologize.

326
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,039
Please...

327
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,509
don't worry about Jin Ah.

328
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,910
I will...

329
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,920
cherish, protect,

330
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,589
and take good care of her.

331
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,130
I'm Choi Si Woo.

332
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:16,769
Oh, I see. Hello.

333
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,799
Jin Ah.

334
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:25,609
He's a director at the company I work.

335
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,180
Oh, I see.

336
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,609
It's nice to meet you.

337
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,750
You two should catch up. I'll be over there.

338
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,069
I'm sorry...

339
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,740
I came too late.

340
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,039
What's going on?

341
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,140
What about your engagement ceremony?

342
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,549
I'm...

343
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,819
not getting engaged.

344
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,650
You're not getting engaged?

345
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,690
What do you mean?

346
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,559
Hey, Choi Si Woo.

347
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,680
What about your engagement ceremony?

348
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:42,049
I'm here now. Can't you guess?

349
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,349
Did you call it off?

350
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,490
Yes.

351
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,430
I'm not getting engaged.

352
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,230
I have Jin Ah, so I can't get engaged to anyone else.

353
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,799
You should've decided so a long ago. Why stress out so many people?

354
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:06,480
Don't you know that it's all your fault?

355
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:09,279
What? Why is it my fault?

356
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,480
Since you showed up,

357
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:14,150
my life has been turning into a mess.

358
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,220
You're clearly no match for me,

359
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,819
but I have to compete with you over the management rights.

360
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,119
Do you know how pathetic I feel?

361
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,660
Had you listened to Grandpa and managed Hyunkang properly,

362
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:27,359
nothing would've happened.

363
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:32,269
And I wouldn't have had to get involved in this headache.

364
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,039
I'd be living a relaxed life in my hometown now.

365
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,640
- If you follow his wishes... - No.

366
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,910
I won't change my mind.

367
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,809
Grandpa's Hyunkang no longer exists.

368
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,420
His Hyunkang was old and trite.

369
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,049
I'll revamp everything.

370
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:53,720
You won't be able to.

371
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,059
I won't let you do that.

372
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,299
Do you know why I canceled my engagement and came here?

373
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,599
Even if I gave up all the benefits...

374
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,930
from the engagement,

375
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,470
I figured that I could get my hands on Hyunkang.

376
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,609
Even if I have to compete only with my competency,

377
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,440
I can beat you easily anyway.

378
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,450
That's not wrong.

379
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,720
But don't let your guard down.

380
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,589
Once I set my mind to something, I see it through.

381
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,119
You should go now.

382
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,660
I know you're her friend,

383
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:34,730
but I don't like seeing another man lurking around my woman.

384
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,869
Let me get it straight.

385
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,170
To Jin Ah, I'm not a man. I'm a friend to her.

386
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,670
So? Are you saying you will keep showing up around her...

387
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,240
to reminisce old memories?

388
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,150
You just have to be good to her.

389
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,880
Don't make her cry or break her heart.

390
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,359
Then I won't have to be by her side.

391
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,460
That won't happen again.

392
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,490
So leave now.

393
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,799
Si Woo.

394
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,500
You seem to be better than I thought you were.

395
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,779
- Yeon Ji, wait. Just a second. - Come on.

396
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,180
Be quiet.

397
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,589
- Be quiet. - Look. Look over there.

398
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:33,990
Gosh. Maybe I should leave you here alone.

399
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,890
My goodness. That's Mr. Choi.

400
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,099
Why is he here?

401
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,099
Exactly.

402
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,269
I mean, why did he cancel his engagement...

403
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,500
and come to Jin Ah's father's funeral?

404
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:52,140
Well, I wouldn't know that either.

405
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,940
I don't think he's here as her boss.

406
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,380
Look at them. They look like a married couple.

407
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,619
No way. Could Mr. Choi and Jin Ah...

408
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,700
We're almost there.

409
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,569
Si Woo, if you wait just a little longer, Hyunkang will be yours.

410
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,440
Why are you doing this? What is wrong with you?

411
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,079
Ms. Jung's father passed away.

412
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,579
We can't go there as we'll attend Mr. Choi's engagement ceremony.

413
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,150
How about we send Yeon Ji on behalf of the team?

414
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,740
Ms. Seo, this is Choi Soo Hee.

415
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,640
Are you at Ms. Jung's father's funeral by any chance?

416
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,240
Yes, Ms. Choi.

417
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,210
Is...

418
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,450
Director Choi there too?

419
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,380
(It's My Life)

420
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:36,210
Since her son's engagement got canceled, she needs to...

421
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,380
comfort herself by drinking.

422
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,450
Are the two of them really dating?

423
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,549
My goodness. Jung Jin Ah, that sly wench.

424
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:48,920
If Jin Ah and I fell into the water, who would you save first?

425
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,529
Well... Of course, I would save...
