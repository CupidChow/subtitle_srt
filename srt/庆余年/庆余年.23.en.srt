1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 23

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,040
You're lucky that you're still alive.

17
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,310
You should know that martial
arts master above the Ninth Dan

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,910
can hear another man's breath

19
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,160
through the wall.

20
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,830
They can figure out my position

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,190
by my voice,

22
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,830
and then they'll shoot you.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,080
Distinguishing location by breaths through the wall,

24
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,800
it doesn't make sense.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,960
They're beyond common sense.

26
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,800
Aren't you thirsty?

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,360
Your Majesty,

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,550
meeting you is like having a
good rain after a long drought.

29
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,390
I'm no longer thirsty.

30
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,240
You've also heard that

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,600
this residence will be heavily guarded

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,670
in future.

33
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,470
Don't break into other's residence

34
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,270
ever again.

35
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,240
Yes.

36
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,750
Are you free tomorrow?

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Probably.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
Come to the imperial palace.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Your marriage with Wan'er

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,160
is settled.

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,080
Wan'er has grown up in the imperial palace.

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,550
The Empress Dowager and my consorts all like her.

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,240
You should meet them.

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,360
I see.

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,000
Fine. You can leave.

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,380
=Taiping Residence=

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,030
Director Yan?

48
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,550
I heard that you killed Cheng Jushu.

49
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
That's right.

50
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,080
How could you kill an Eighth Dan martial arts master?

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,630
I was lucky.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Who's that archer outside the yard?

53
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,470
What archer? I've no idea.

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,600
You'd better answer my question honestly.

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
His Majesty just told you

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,550
to let me pass.

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,800
Director Yan, are you going to defy the imperial order?

58
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,110
I'll remember you.

59
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,910
See you.

60
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,830
Brother!

61
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,830
What happened?

62
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,640
The archer is so good!

63
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,640
He broke off the tree with arrows.

64
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,110
Where's Uncle Wuzhu?

65
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,160
He's gone.

66
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,480
Never mind. That's his style.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,670
Have you found the key?

68
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,720
No.

69
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,320
I met His Majesty instead.

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,040
His Majesty?

71
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,390
His Majesty is inside?

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
He seems to know my mom well.

73
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,070
Have you asked him about her?

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
He wouldn't tell me.

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,110
Let's go. Wan'er should be worried.

76
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,720
The Crown Prince was taken?!

77
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,600
It's fine. My father planned it.

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,790
Your father wants to take the Crown Prince?!

79
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,880
They've taken the wrong person.

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Actually, you're the one he wants to test.

81
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,040
He wants to know

82
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,670
whether you have a Great Master

83
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,880
by your side or not.

84
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,480
He's still suspicious of me.

85
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,350
My third cousin said

86
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,550
you are not the murderer.

87
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,070
You actually hid that

88
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,160
from my brother the whole way!

89
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll apologize to you later.

90
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,550
You'd better take Dabao back

91
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,440
at once.

92
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,600
My third cousin said that

93
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,350
by telling my father the following words,

94
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,440
he'll know the murderer

95
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,480
naturally.

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,440
What did the Crown Prince say?

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,600
No!

98
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,070
My eyes! My eyes!

99
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,950
What's wrong with your eyes?

100
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,070
I fooled you.

101
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,390
Little one! Little one!

102
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,350
Fan Xian.

103
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,070
Why do you follow me?

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,670
I trust you.

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,720
I believe Wan'er trusts you, too.

106
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,230
As to what happened today, she must have her difficulties.

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,830
Don't hate her

108
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,040
for that.

109
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,230
Does my love for Wan'er

110
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,880
seem so frangible?

111
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,950
Don't worry. I know that.

112
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,600
Little one! Little one!

113
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,110
-Little one! -Dabao!

114
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,040
Little one!

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,880
Dabao!

116
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Xianxian, get down and play with us.

117
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
Dabao, let me take you home.

118
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,830
Get down and play with us.

119
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,550
It's about time.

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,510
Let me take you home.

121
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,920
We can come out for dinner another day.

122
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,720
Sister,

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
will you also escort me home?

124
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,390
That's OK.

125
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,880
I can escort you home with Fan Xian.

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,880
Good! Good!

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,230
Then let's go home! Let's go!

128
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,070
Ruoruo,

129
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,830
do me a favor.

130
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,110
What is it?

131
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,670
The guys we sent to test Fan Xian

132
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,230
are back.

133
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,270
Prime Minister, you don't have to show up.

134
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,000
Let me meet him instead.

135
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,950
Thank you, Master. Please figure out the truth.

136
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,550
Master.

137
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,320
How's it going?

138
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,790
We captured Fan Xian

139
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,640
and detained him in the capital city.

140
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,590
Master, please go and see him.

141
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,760
I asked you to find out

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,640
whether he has a martial arts master by his side or not.

143
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,000
Why did you take him into the capital city?

144
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,520
We didn't see the martial arts master,

145
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,550
but he figured out that

146
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,670
we take orders from the Prime Minister.

147
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,230
He requested to see the Prime Minister all the way.

148
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,280
Did you admit your identity?

149
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,880
No! No!

150
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,550
Of course I didn't.

151
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,880
We just detained him

152
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,670
to wait for your order.

153
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,880
Isn't that the same as admitting your identity?

154
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,350
I can't meet him in person.

155
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,840
Release Fan Xian immediately.

156
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,320
After all, he's an official.

157
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,400
If it turns into a big mess,

158
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,790
we won't be able to justify ourselves.

159
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,400
OK! OK! OK!

160
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,760
Master Yuan, good day.

161
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,520
Dabao, good day.

162
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,710
-Let's go. -Good day, Master Yuan.

163
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,200
Let's go.

164
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,350
This is the study.

165
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Master,

166
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,000
should I release Fan Xian

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
now?

168
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,030
Release whom?

169
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,840
Fan Xian of course.

170
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,590
Then who's that?

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,590
I've never met him. Who's that?

172
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,110
Who on earth did you capture?

173
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,470
Dad, Xianxian and Wan'er

174
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,640
were both there.

175
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,520
Then they just

176
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,400
sat there and talked.

177
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,110
Later,

178
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,030
a little one came.

179
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,760
The little one and I,

180
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
we caught fish

181
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,470
by the pond.

182
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,960
Then we played stone skimming.

183
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,550
Right! We even had a competition.

184
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,440
Dad, I won!

185
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,880
Later,

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,150
we also poked worm holes.

187
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,670
Then...

188
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,880
I washed my hands, Dad.

189
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,960
-Look! -Good! Good! Good!

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,030
-I washed them clean. -Good! Good! Good!

191
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,640
Come on. Drink some water first.

192
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
Thank you, Dad.

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,200
Dad,

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
there are a lot of people in white

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,110
in the front yard.

196
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,550
Many of them are crying.

197
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
They're having a funeral.

198
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,640
A funeral?

199
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,960
I've never seen one.

200
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,840
Then go and see it yourself.

201
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,000
In the main hall of the front yard lies

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,960
a big wooden box.

203
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,440
Go and kowtow to it.

204
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,320
Why?

205
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,960
It's the rule. Everyone should do it.

206
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,880
Xianxian,

207
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,030
will you go with me?

208
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,520
Then you can talk with my dad here.

209
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,110
I'll come back to you in a while.

210
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,200
Take a seat.

211
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,150
Why do you send Dabao back

212
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,280
so early?

213
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,790
Wan'er told me everything.

214
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,840
Really?

215
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,030
I understand.

216
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,320
You have to figure out who murdered your son.

217
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,230
Drink some tea.

218
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,470
The Crown Prince came to see me.

219
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,030
He asked me to tell you the following words.

220
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,150
He said that after hearing the words,

221
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,000
you'll know the murderer naturally.

222
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,840
What did he say?

223
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,280
The murderer is a Great Master.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,440
If the murderer is close to the level of Great Master,

225
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,110
then he could be anyone above the Ninth Dan.

226
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,110
But now, the murderer

227
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,670
is limited to the Four Great Masters.

228
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,520
Can't there be a fifth one?

229
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,280
Impossible!

230
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
I've had it investigated that

231
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
when it happened,

232
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,760
Ye Liuyun, Ku He and Si Gujian

233
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,110
were not around the capital city.

234
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,960
I guessed right.

235
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,200
The Great Master inside the
imperial palace is the murderer.

236
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,230
Under whose order?

237
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,350
His Majesty, Her Majesty, the Empress Dowager,

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
the Princess Royal, the Second Prince, or the Crown Prince.

239
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,520
It could be anyone.

240
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Since the Crown Prince gave us the information,

241
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,760
it might not be him.

242
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,640
Isn't the Princess Royal

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
the birth mother of Wan'er?

244
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,230
That woman

245
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,470
is crazy.

246
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Since the imperial palace is involved,

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,230
why did the Crown Prince tell us?

248
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,910
Prime Minister.

249
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,960
To figure it out,

250
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,670
we might as well ask him about it.

251
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,470
Our men

252
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,590
captured him accidentally.

253
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,960
I heard that from Wan'er.

254
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,790
Haven't you released him yet?

255
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,550
He requested to see me.

256
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,320
And you also.

257
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,520
See me?

258
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,030
Master Yuan,

259
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,030
which sin have we committed

260
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,030
by abducting the Crown Prince?

261
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,350
Guard outside.

262
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,400
You won't be blamed.

263
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,590
Your Highness, I...

264
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,000
No need to adhere to the formalities
rigidly. And no need to explain.

265
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,790
I've known it all.

266
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,350
Prime Minister,

267
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,840
have you received my elegiac couplet

268
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,400
for the Second Young Master?

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,550
How can you be so sure that

270
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,550
the murderer is a Great Master?

271
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,880
The Investigator's Office produced

272
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,030
two files to record the death cause of your son.

273
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,910
The one sent to the imperial palace

274
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,030
tells the real truth.

275
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,590
Why do you

276
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,350
tell me?

277
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,350
Isolated and helpless as I am in the imperial court,

278
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,470
I want to form an alliance with you.

279
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,550
Your Highness, you're dignified and
respected all over the country

280
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,110
with numerous talents under your command.

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,760
Why do you want me as an ally?

282
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,590
I know what I really have.

283
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,760
I have many followers,

284
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,910
but none of them holds an
important place in the Six Ministries.

285
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,200
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager

286
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,910
don't favor me.

287
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,760
Now Chengze instead

288
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,230
is gaining more respect and support.

289
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,150
Who knows when

290
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,910
I'll have to hand my position

291
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,030
as the Crown Prince over to him.

292
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,470
What can I do for you?

293
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,790
You are the head of the officials.

294
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,200
Only by joining hands together

295
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,080
can we stand a chance.

296
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,520
Why are you still hesitating?

297
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Your son's death is definitely ordered

298
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,320
by someone in the imperial palace.

299
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,960
Only by joining hands with me

300
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
can you figure out the truth,

301
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,280
find the real murderer,

302
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,320
and avenge your son's death.

303
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,670
What if His Majesty is the one

304
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,670
who ordered his death?

305
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,440
I just said

306
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,230
you could avenge your son's death.

307
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,110
No word should be left concerning our alliance.

308
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,430
Of course.

309
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,710
It's OK as long as we reach consensus in heart.

310
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,310
Why do you

311
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,520
ask Fan Xian over specially?

312
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,800
Prime Minister, he's the one

313
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,000
we should fully support in future.

314
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,520
Your Highness, you mean...

315
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,950
As to our war against Beiqi,

316
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,760
we've already captured one prefecture.

317
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,430
The two sides called a truce in the
frontline the day before yesterday.

318
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,760
The Beiqi mission

319
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,590
are on their way to the capital city.

320
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,000
Why am I related?

321
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,310
This war is started

322
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,880
by your investigation on Si Lili.

323
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,160
That is to say,

324
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,760
you've owned the top prize.

325
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,000
We may have disputes,

326
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,760
but we've never born

327
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,110
a deep grudge against each other.

328
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,040
You're talented, and I cherish talents.

329
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,230
Why not join me?

330
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,000
The Neiku will be handed over to you eventually,

331
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,590
and I can let you have it.

332
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,710
From today on,

333
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,830
the Prime Minister and I

334
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,350
will both be your support.

335
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,800
We'll promise you a brilliant future.

336
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,950
Think it over.

337
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,590
We are still young.

338
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,710
When I ascend the throne,

339
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,950
we might make a much-told story
of the emperor and his subject

340
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,950
fighting together from the start to the end.

341
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,710
Be quiet outside!

342
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,190
They have no rules!

343
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,880
What on earth is happening outside?!

344
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,520
Your men are here to rescue you.

345
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
Impossible!

346
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,920
What happened?

347
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,350
Your Highness, please stay inside.

348
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,110
The guards outside were slaughtered brutally.

349
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,280
They must be killed by martial arts masters.

350
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,830
Where are you going?

351
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,350
Go out and see what's going on.

352
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,070
It's dangerous.

353
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm the only one here who can practice martial arts.

354
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,430
Or shall we let His Highness go out?

355
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,520
Xie Bi'an.

356
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,070
I heard that you are endowed with civil and martial virtues.

357
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,880
Maybe we should compete with other swords.

358
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,560
Don't blame him.

359
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,760
Xie Bi'an is born with a poker face.

360
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,710
He never said anything nice to me.

361
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,830
I didn't expect that

362
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,000
you would come.

363
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,280
Neither do I.

364
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,000
Don't listen to that one inside.

365
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,920
He's always a persuasive talker.

366
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,470
I didn't hear anything.

367
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,190
Let's go inside.

368
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,880
It's slippery. Slow down.

369
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,470
Sorry for coming late.

370
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,470
Your Highness, please forgive me.

371
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,310
Why are you here?

372
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,590
I was burning with anxiety

373
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,710
after hearing that Your Highness was abducted,

374
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,760
so I took Xie Bi'an with me to rescue you.

375
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,710
But don't worry, Your Highness.

376
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,110
The bandits outside

377
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,430
were all killed by Xie Bi'an.

378
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,350
Prime Minister, are you also here to rescue His Highness?

379
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,160
I just passed by.

380
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,230
Do you know the bandits outside?

381
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,470
I've never met them.

382
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,640
Then I'm relieved.

383
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,040
I was worried that

384
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,110
reckless as Xie Bi'an is,

385
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
he might hurt our men.

386
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,160
Your Highness, you're so kind.

387
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,950
How admirable!

388
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm so flattered.

389
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,830
Now that the Crown Prince is safe,

390
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,830
I'll leave first.

391
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,280
Your sword is nice.

392
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,430
How much is it?

393
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,230
Let's go.

394
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,880
OK.

395
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,560
Nice sword.

396
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,920
You're really watching me closely all the time!

397
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,350
Your Highness, you're the Crown Prince

398
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,920
and my brother as well.

399
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,470
How can I not try my best

400
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,430
to protect your safety?

401
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,000
What a nice brother!

402
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm so touched!

403
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,230
It's my duty.

404
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,950
But Your Highness, do feel relieved.

405
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,560
I've been keeping an eye on

406
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,760
the capital city

407
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,110
on your behalf.

408
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,070
Any sign of disturbance

409
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,760
won't escape my eyes.

410
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,800
Then I'm relieved.

411
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,190
May I escort Your Highness

412
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,880
back to the Eastern Palace?

413
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,310
You're most welcome.

414
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,110
Why is the Second Prince coming so fast?

415
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,310
They are

416
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,070
really competing fiercely.

417
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,230
Uncle, will you really ally with the Crown Prince?

418
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,350
I was just saying.

419
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,000
It's better not to offend either of them.

420
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,190
Now the imperial court is in chaos.

421
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,230
We can take this chance

422
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,800
and get you a higher rank.

423
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,760
This time, I really mean it.

424
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,110
No more suspicions.

425
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,070
I just don't know

426
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,070
how much time I've left.

427
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,310
But Uncle,

428
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,190
you look healthy.

429
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,950
I won't die for the moment.

430
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,640
I mean how long can I

431
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,880
keep my position?

432
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,800
Actually, being an official is like being a man.

433
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,190
It's like standing on the top of a mountain.

434
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,520
The further you move forward,
the more cautious you should be.

435
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,070
Otherwise, you'll be doomed eternally.

436
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,230
Can I retreat on my own?

437
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,310
You can't once you go up.

438
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,920
Prime Minister.

439
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,710
They were all killed.

440
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,830
No one was left alive.

441
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,070
All their families are outside the capital city.

442
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,400
Don't bury them.

443
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,400
We can't afford to take any risk.

444
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,470
Help their families settle down well.

445
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,280
Don't blame me for being merciless.

446
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,400
If I'm softhearted, I might endanger myself.

447
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,680
Well, enough for today.

448
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,430
You've been through a lot today.

449
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,430
Go back early.

450
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,040
Uncle.

451
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,230
You're here.

452
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,520
You're upset.

453
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,190
So many things happened today.

454
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,280
The powerful arrow of Yan Xiaoyi.

455
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,830
The brutality of Xie Bi'an.

456
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,920
Running into His Majesty in the Taiping Residence.

457
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,950
Removing Lin Ruofu's suspicion

458
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,070
of me completely.

459
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,070
Also,

460
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,830
the Second Prince and the Crown Prince

461
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,830
are standing in sharp opposition to each other.

462
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,640
Which one upsets you?

463
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,640
The Crown Prince is trying to draw me over to his side.

464
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,640
We may have disputes,

465
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,350
but we've never born a deep grudge against each other.

466
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,350
You're talented, and I cherish talents.

467
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,000
Why not join me?

468
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,350
What's wrong?

469
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
We used to believe that

470
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,190
Lin Gong planned the Niulan Street assassination

471
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,830
at the command of the Crown Prince.

472
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,350
But now

473
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,560
he actually said he had never

474
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,680
born a deep grudge against me.

475
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,520
Maybe he believes you don't know the truth.

476
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,710
The news that Lin Gong tried to assassinate me

477
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,800
has spread all over the capital city.

478
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,800
If the Crown Prince is really behind it,

479
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,230
he won't lay down his guard against me

480
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,310
so easily.

481
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,950
Maybe he doesn't mean it.

482
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,230
He asked to see me specially.

483
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,950
Judged from his look,

484
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,590
he really wants to draw me over to his side.

485
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,830
So?

486
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,800
So I've been wondering

487
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,070
what if

488
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,190
the Crown Prince

489
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,560
didn't give the order.

490
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,350
Then who would it be?

491
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,560
I also want to know.

492
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,710
If you can't figure it out now,

493
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,590
just think about it some other day.

494
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,110
Sometimes,

495
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,760
I do envy your character.

496
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,400
It doesn't suit you.

497
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,040
Indeed!

498
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,560
Have you found the key?

499
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,430
No.

500
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,830
Then it must be kept in the imperial palace.

501
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,760
Most of your mom's things

502
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,830
are kept by that old lady.

503
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,310
Which old lady?

504
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,110
The Empress Dowager.

505
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,760
Once we confirm its location,

506
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
the rest is easy.

507
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,950
The only problem

508
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,830
is that Great Master Hong Sixiang in the imperial palace.

509
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,350
Is he a guard beside His Majesty?

510
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,640
He guards right beside the Empress Dowager.

511
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,680
Nothing is worse

512
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,110
than that.

513
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,830
The mosquito bites

514
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,310
are really itchy.

515
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,400
They sure are.

516
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,950
Look, there's no mosquito

517
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,640
around the Empress Dowager.

518
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Eunuch Hong is there.

519
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,190
How dare the mosquitoes go there?

520
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,950
By then, we'll adopt our strategy today.

521
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,190
What strategy?

522
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,280
I will hold the Great Master,

523
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,710
and you will go inside to find the key.

524
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,280
Uncle.

525
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,190
Besides the Great Master,

526
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,590
Yan Xiaoyi, the Director of Imperial Guards,

527
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,950
also guards the imperial palace

528
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,920
all the year round.

529
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,640
Just go and find the key.

530
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,920
You really trust me so much?

531
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,560
In this world, I can trust no one

532
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,190
but you.

533
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,680
Uncle,

534
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,710
have you ever felt lonely?

535
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,310
No.

536
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,000
Even after my mom

537
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,590
passed away?

538
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,560
Right.

539
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
When you get old,

540
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,680
I'll be there for you.

541
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,310
I probably won't get old.

542
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,830
Then when I get old,

543
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
you should be there for me.

544
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,110
Only if you still feel like that

545
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,640
by then.

546
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,430
OK.

547
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,190
Speaking of my life,

548
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,350
you're the first man I saw

549
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,830
since I could remember.

550
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,160
Perhaps,

551
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,950
you'll also be the last man I see

552
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,230
in future.

553
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,430
Maybe you're still young

554
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,590
even by then.

555
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,830
Shouldn't we discuss about

556
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,800
finding the key in the imperial palace?

557
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,590
Right.

558
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,280
Go on.

559
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,190
The problem is

560
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,800
do you know where the Empress Dowager lives.

561
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,000
No, I don't.

562
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,230
Well then.

563
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,950
You should find a chance to go to the imperial palace

564
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,000
to figure out the route.

565
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,280
What a coincidence!

566
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm going to the imperial palace tomorrow.

567
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,800
How is that?

568
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,590
Good. Remember to figure out the route.

569
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,190
Isn't there anything in the world

570
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,160
that can surprise you?

571
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,350
No.

572
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,190
Well, good for you.

573
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,830
No words can express

574
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,880
my admiration for you.

575
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,760
Uncle.

576
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,950
Do you find the climate especially dry

577
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,400
in the capital city?

578
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,680
Luckily, I'm ingenious.

579
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,160
I made a humidifier myself.

580
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,760
It has a mechanical structure
and is driven by hydraulic power.

581
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,400
Someone's here.

582
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,350
Who?

583
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,710
Why are you here?

584
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,040
Ruoruo left the door open for me.

585
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,470
What's this?

586
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,430
The climate in the capital city

587
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,230
is drier than that of Danzhou,

588
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,400
so I made a humidifier myself.

589
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,280
Humidifier?

590
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,190
Do you have anything for me?

591
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,430
The starry sky is so beautiful tonight.

592
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,800
Would you like to join me

593
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,680
in watching the stars?

594
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,400
As a child, I lived in the imperial palace.

595
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,430
My father and mother couldn't visit me.

596
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,190
Every night,

597
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,230
I was alone

598
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,190
in a really big room.

599
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,110
From then on,

600
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,800
I was particularly fond of watching the starry sky.

601
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,110
Because I had nothing else to watch

602
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,680
except for the starry sky.

603
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,000
And my disease...

604
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,400
the tuberculosis

605
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,520
just couldn't be cured.

606
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,280
I felt that

607
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,400
I could die anytime.

608
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,520
In the day,

609
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,710
I talked to others with a smile.

610
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,070
But actually, I was so scared.

611
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,230
I'm here.

612
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,470
I won't let you die.

613
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,430
I dared not be close to others,

614
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,230
for fear that

615
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,870
if I died of disease suddenly,

616
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,520
they might be heartbroken.

617
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,630
But the fact is

618
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,520
nobody wanted to be close to me.

619
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,910
After all, I'm just a bastard.

620
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,280
So am I.

621
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,870
You're different.

622
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,870
You've experienced a lot,

623
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,560
but I was locked up in the imperial palace.

624
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,600
I once heard that

625
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,800
life is like

626
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,710
walking on a road.

627
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,230
You keep meeting different people

628
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,800
and parting with them.

629
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,230
I'm so envious of that.

630
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,120
I've walked the way

631
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,190
all by myself.

632
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,910
Never have I met

633
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,280
anyone else.

634
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,430
I could only walk by myself

635
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
step by step.

636
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,080
I thought

637
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,430
I would walk alone to death.

638
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,150
But unexpectedly,

639
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,080
you showed up.

640
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,360
Fan Xian, it feels so good

641
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,630
to have a company.

642
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,280
I will always be here for you.

643
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,190
But I'm so scared.

644
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm scared that one day you'll leave,

645
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
and then I'll be all alone again.

646
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,910
You won't be alone any more.

647
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,320
I'm sorry.

648
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,840
I lied to you about the outing today.

649
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,280
I didn't tell you that

650
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
my father wanted to test you.

651
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,390
I don't know how can I express my regrets

652
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,150
or how can I make it up to you.

653
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,120
So,

654
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,520
I could only sneak out

655
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,360
and watch the starry night

656
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,870
with you.

657
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,000
Look!

658
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,040
Isn't the starry sky

659
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,390
especially beautiful tonight?

660
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,190
Yes, indeed!

661
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,870
In my heart,

662
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,280
it's the most beautiful

663
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,320
and precious thing.

664
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,760
Besides this,

665
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,870
I don't know what else I can give you.

666
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,190
You've given me the entire starry sky.

667
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,760
I want nothing

668
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,120
but this.

669
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,080
I won't lie to you anymore.

670
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,040
Me, too.

671
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,870
From today on,

672
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,710
no more lies.

673
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,950
Look!

674
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,710
It's not as beautiful as you.

675
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,870
We are among the boundless crowd

676
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,840
as stars among the night sky.

677
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,040
These days,

678
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,760
I've been thinking about the story of

679
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,710
one hundred branches of cherry blossoms you told me.

680
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,190
I feel sorry

681
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,320
for their love.

682
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,670
Now

683
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,560
I finally understand

684
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,710
why you told me

685
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,520
the story.

686
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,430
Because among the boundless crowd,

687
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,470
we are

688
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,470
so lucky

689
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,870
to meet each other.

690
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,520
You don't want us to miss each other.

691
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,040
We won't

692
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,840
miss each other for sure.

693
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,600
How about a hug before I leave?

694
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,100
=Fan mansion=

695
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,040
We've received an imperial decree to
summon you into the imperial palace.

696
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,910
Summon who?

697
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,150
This time,

698
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,840
you'll mainly visit the imperial harem.

699
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,000
It's you.

700
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,190
Go with him this time.

701
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,000
Fine.

702
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,520
Can Ruoruo come with us?

703
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,120
Your sister has never

704
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,320
liked such occasions.

705
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,670
I'd love to.

706
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,320
Fine then.

707
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,150
Me, too.

708
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,520
No, I won't go.

709
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,000
I don't like such occasions.

710
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,040
When we go inside the imperial palace,

711
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,560
help me remember

712
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,430
the routes between different palaces.

713
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,670
Pay attention to the details.

714
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,870
OK.

715
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,230
I might have to break into the imperial palace.

716
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,360
Then I'll try my best to remember the details.

717
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,560
Aren't you scared?

718
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,630
Brother, whatever you want to do, I'll help you.

719
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,320
Why are you following us?

720
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,710
When you're in the imperial palace,

721
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,040
will you request a consort to write something for me?

722
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,870
Write what?

723
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,150
Our Danbo Bookstore

724
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,430
is about to open.

725
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,390
With the name written by the imperial family,

726
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,710
we'll be the Imperial Danbo Bookstore.

727
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,000
By then,

728
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,600
there must be a lot of customers.

729
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,150
The word Imperial doesn't go with Danbo.
(Danbo means indifferent to fame and fortune in Chinese.)

730
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,320
Then we can change the name.

731
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,390
We open the bookstore

732
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,630
to make money.

733
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,910
In my opinion,

734
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
we should call it Dali Bookstore.
(Dali means big profits in Chinese.)

735
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,000
Get lost.

736
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,670
Well.

737
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,430
Do remember that.

738
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,760
Don't forget.

739
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,560
Brother!

740
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,520
Haven't seen you for a long time.

741
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,190
Madam, you're gorgeous.

742
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,950
Eunuch, I'm so flattered.

743
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,320
I wonder

744
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,870
who want to see Xian'er today?

745
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,760
Those who watched the princess grow up

746
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,430
all want to see Mr. Fan.

747
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,280
The Empress Dowager

748
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,950
also wants to see him.

749
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,320
But she'll see him after lunch.

750
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,360
Who should we visit first?

751
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,950
Madam, since you're here,

752
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,840
you certainly should visit Consort Yi first.

753
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,600
What about the empress?

754
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,380
In the river of history,

755
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,580
time goes round and round.

756
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,940
Memories about the former and present lives

757
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,820
join each other in an endless way.

758
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,420
In the long drunken Milky Way,

759
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,140
one season follows another in a flash,

760
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,340
and the wild geese are flying south.

761
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,260
I just can't give up

762
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,260
to be with you for my whole life.

763
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:51,540
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

764
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

765
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,220
Year after year in the wandering,

766
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,780
I count the remaining years.

767
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,980
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

768
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,540
even though we have ended up the destiny,

769
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,220
I never feel regretful.

770
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,180
In such a chaotic world,

771
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,940
I still miss you as ever.

772
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,580
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

773
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,300
With a gentle heart,

774
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,860
I cherish our remaining years.

775
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,700
Even though we have to go through

776
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,660
all the hardships along the journey,

777
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:30,980
you always stay by my side,

778
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,740
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

779
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,660
Year after year in the wandering,

780
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,020
I count the remaining years.

781
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,380
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

782
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,180
even though we end up the destiny,

783
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,620
I never feel regretful.

784
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,540
In such a chaotic world,

785
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,500
I still miss you as ever.

786
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,180
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

787
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,940
With a gentle heart,

788
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,340
I cherish our remaining years.

789
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,140
Even though we have to go through

790
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,300
all the hardships along the journey,

791
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:11,580
you always stay by my side...
