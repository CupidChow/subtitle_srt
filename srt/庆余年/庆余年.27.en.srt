1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,660
Episode 27

16
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,400
The lines are exactly the same.

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,520
Even without the handwritten copy,

18
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,270
we can see the truth.

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,910
The latter four lines of the poem

20
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,390
depict a desolated

21
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,470
and frustrated life.

22
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,880
Without going through

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,600
ups and downs in life,

24
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,440
how could anyone ever depict such an artistic conception?

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,190
But Mr. Fan,

26
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,960
you're successful and famous at a young age.

27
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,240
How could you be so sad

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,520
and desolated?

29
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,630
When a young man tries to express sorrow,

30
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,750
he would normally go too far.

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,390
Your Majesty!

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,800
Your Majesty!

33
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,600
Fan Xian gains a reputation by deception.

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,390
He's utterly shameless.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,270
By doing so,

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
he has disgraced

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,110
all the scholars of Nanqing.

38
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,030
I beg Your Majesty to

39
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,960
deprive him of his official title,

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
expel him from the capital city,

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,240
and never recruit him as an official again.

42
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,110
Mr. Guo.

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
Since I've disgraced

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,550
Nanqing,

45
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,470
why are you so happy?

46
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,880
Nonsense!

47
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,390
I'm just furious.

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,000
I feel ashamed to be your colleague.

49
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,190
When did you know that Master Zhuang

50
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,630
would argue about the truth on the Hall?

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,960
I just heard him of course.

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,030
Then why did you say with certainty that

53
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,160
I would be utterly discredited

54
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,670
the moment I arrived at

55
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,600
the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest?

56
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,550
Either you're good at fortune-telling,

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,030
or you've hooked up with Master Zhuang

58
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,390
in advance!

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
Nonsense!

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,470
How could you use "hook up" to describe

61
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,630
my relationship with Master Zhuang?

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,800
Stop it!

63
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,190
At such a critical moment,

64
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,720
just forget about the choice of words.

65
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,070
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,950
my son doesn't get along with Fan Xian all the time.

67
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,000
Their dispute matters nothing.

68
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,640
What's important now

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,830
is Fan Xian's poem.

70
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,040
Since he copied other's work,

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
he should be severely punished,

72
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,760
or the public anger

73
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,760
won't be quelled.

74
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,000
Minister, good for you.

75
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,390
You pointed out the heart of the matter directly.

76
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,670
I just spoke my mind impartially.

77
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Master Zhuang,

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,160
you're right.

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,390
I copied that poem from others.

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,110
He really copied from other's work!

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,760
How could he do that?!

82
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,790
He's dishonest.

83
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,950
I'm wrong about him.

84
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,070
Mr. Fan,

85
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,670
you're brave to admit your mistake.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,480
After this, you're sure

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,550
to achieve great success in future.

88
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,950
Stop flattering me.

89
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,200
Master Zhuang,

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,040
I copied poem for myself,

91
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,790
and you copied poem for your teacher.

92
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,830
We're no different.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,440
In fact,

94
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,320
you're not as frank as I am.

95
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,510
This poem

96
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,350
is written by Du Fu, the Saint of Poem,

97
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,480
who is also known as Shaoling Yelao.

98
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,720
It has nothing to do with your teacher.

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,830
Gaining fame for your teacher by deceiving the public,

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,040
Master Zhuang is really a role model
of respecting teacher and honoring truth.

101
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,320
The Saint of Poem?

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Which dynasty

103
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,230
was he from?

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,760
As the Saint of Poem,

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,160
did he go down in history?

106
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,230
We can't find him in historical records.

107
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,070
I see.

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,440
Because his poems

109
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,270
are from another world.

110
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
A world lasts for thousands of years

111
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,790
and is filled with splendid poems.

112
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Is it the fairyland

113
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,550
existed in legends?

114
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,230
Feel free to laugh! Feel free to laugh!

115
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,670
It's definitely the fairyland

116
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,510
compared to your world.

117
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,670
Have you been there?

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,040
It's a picture scroll left from my dream,

119
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,440
a memory left in my head.

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,270
Your Excellency Fan,

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,390
you mean

122
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,670
you've travelled to the fairyland

123
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,110
and recited a poem in your dream.

124
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,880
Your Majesty,

125
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,350
what Fan Xian said

126
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,950
is utterly ridiculous.

127
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,000
By making up such an absurd story,
he lied to Your Majesty.

128
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,320
Your Majesty, I beg you to punish him!

129
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,270
Master Zhuang,

130
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,200
has your teacher written a lot of poems?

131
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,000
My teacher has written many excellent poems.

132
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,390
Does he have many unpublished poems?

133
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,270
I've gone through all his works,

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,390
and that is the only poem

135
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,880
that remains unpublished.

136
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,200
Who told you I only recited one poem in my dream?

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,110
Give me paper.

138
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,440
Give me ink.

139
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,350
Mr. Fan,

140
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,070
if you want to compose poems,

141
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,670
I'd like to write them down for you.

142
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,550
You want to

143
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,320
improvise more poems

144
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,830
to prove that you saw them all

145
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,670
from the fairyland?

146
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,640
You don't know.

147
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,350
That memory

148
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,510
is literally carved

149
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,110
into my head.

150
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,670
Every word I saw

151
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,880
and every book I read,

152
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,200
I can remember them clearly

153
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,670
as if they're right in front of me.

154
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Do you know what you're talking about?

155
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm afraid he's so exasperated that

156
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,910
he starts to talk nonsense.

157
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,590
Don't you see the Yellow River pouring from heaven,

158
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,710
rushing to the sea, never to return?

159
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,200
Don't you see, in the hall
the mirror is saddened by the grey hair?

160
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,960
Young and dark at dawn, but at dusk snowy!

161
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,670
Ah, let's enjoy ourselves while we can.

162
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,440
It's wrong to set goblets idle, in the glory of the moon.

163
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,550
I was created by Heaven, certainly not for nothing.

164
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,470
As for money, it scatters and gathers as money should.

165
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,670
When will there be no more moon and spring flowers?

166
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,520
For me who had so many memorable hours?

167
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,320
If you ask me how much my sorrow has increased,

168
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,470
just see the overbrimming river flowing east!

169
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,350
I do not know in the celestial sphere

170
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,760
what name this festive night goes by?

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,760
I want to fly home, riding the air,

172
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,000
but fear the ethereal cold up there.

173
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,710
The jade and crystal mansions are so high!

174
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,470
Dancing to my shadow,

175
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,350
I feel no longer the mortal tie.

176
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,000
Though drunk, we lit the lamp to see the glaive.

177
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Sober, we heard the horns from tent to tent.

178
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,670
Under the flags,
beef grilled was eaten by our warriors brave.

179
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,280
And martial airs were played by fifty instruments.

180
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,520
It was an autumn maneuver in the field.

181
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,200
We wished to fly in heaven,
two birds with the wings of one,

182
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,470
and to grow together on the earth,
two branches of one tree.

183
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,790
On the road ahead surely will be friends dear and true.

184
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,670
Throughout the land is there anyone who knows not you?

185
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,440
My attic which last night in vernal wind did stand.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,080
A few plum twigs at the corner of the wall

187
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,030
blossoming all alone, defying the cold!

188
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,350
Would you have me bow my head before mighty princes?

189
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,840
On war-torn land streams flow and mountains stand.

190
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,320
In vernal town grass and weeds are overgrown.

191
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,550
Though I am white-haired, still I'd sing and drink my fill.

192
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,470
Hating to part, hearing birds breaks our heart.

193
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,280
We can't fly wing to wing like a pair of phoenixes,

194
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,840
yet our hearts closely linked beat in harmony.

195
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,710
Here's my precious horse, here's my priceless fur.

196
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,080
Tell the boy to give them for the wine.

197
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,550
I want to fly home, riding the air,

198
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,280
but fear the ethereal cold up there.

199
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,880
Hear spring rain falling in a small mansion all night!

200
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,840
Till mountains crumble, streams run dry,

201
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,320
thunder rumbles in winter, snow falls in summer.

202
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,840
West of the Yangguan Pass you'll see no more of mine.

203
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,760
I do not know in the celestial sphere.

204
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,280
Men are born sentimental and emotional.

205
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,590
Myriad footpaths with no human traces shown.

206
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,910
For the long years,

207
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,230
to whom can I my grief convey?

208
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,280
Youth do not know real depression.

209
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,550
Time passes indifferently,
turning people from young to old.

210
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,710
Revived even if she be, could she still know me?

211
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,080
Near a cottage a stream flows.

212
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,520
How panic-stricken I was retreating before the Tartars!

213
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,230
Being a captive, I lamented over my solitary confinement.

214
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Who can avert his death since time immemorial?

215
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,670
Let my heart remain true to shine in the annals.

216
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,440
No ancients before me,

217
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,960
nor comers from behind.

218
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
Reflecting on the infinite heaven and earth,

219
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,550
Alone, in a sadness sublime, my tears come.

220
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,230
Is it over one hundred?

221
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,880
Mr. Fan, it's way over one hundred.

222
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,110
That'll be enough.

223
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,960
How could there be any fairyland in the world?

224
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,790
If not,

225
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,760
where do all these poems come from?

226
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,760
They must be written by himself!

227
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,590
Even if he writes them all,

228
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,320
even if he writes thousands of poems,

229
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,200
it can't prove that

230
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,710
he didn't copy that poem.

231
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,960
He can recite marvelous poems without thinking.

232
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
Why would he

233
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,350
copy other's work?

234
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,520
Why should he?

235
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,910
When it comes to explaining
classic texts and annotating articles,

236
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,710
you win.

237
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,400
But when it comes to reciting poems,

238
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,960
I win.

239
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,880
For a literary giant,

240
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm not qualified.

241
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,590
But for a man,

242
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,030
you're not qualified.

243
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,880
Since I am drunk and sleepy, you may go...

244
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:01,260
go to hell.

245
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,320
What's wrong, Master Zhuang?

246
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,230
-Master Zhuang! -Master Zhuang! -Master Zhuang!

247
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,670
Master Zhuang, wake up!

248
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,520
Get the imperial physician!

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,080
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

250
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,350
Come on. Put the sober soup on the table.

251
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,550
Put it here! Put it here! Right!

252
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,640
Plump the pillow

253
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,670
to make it soft.

254
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,640
He drank too much.

255
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,760
Make sure he won't get a stiff neck tomorrow.

256
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,110
The plan remains unchanged.
Wait for me outside the palace walls.

257
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,200
Well.

258
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,590
You're so drunk.

259
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,320
Let's make it another day.

260
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,470
He's here! He's here!

261
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,470
Mr. Fan, the poetic genius, is here!

262
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,710
You're here! Hurry up!

263
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,150
Put him on the bed! Put him on the bed!

264
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,320
Be careful! Be careful!

265
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,030
Slow down!

266
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,200
Cover him up!

267
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,470
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

268
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,230
Be careful! Cover him up!

269
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,350
Thank you!

270
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,670
You may go back and rest.

271
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,400
Thank you!

272
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,520
I'll take care of my brother.

273
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,710
You may go back and rest.

274
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,080
There're a lot of servants here.

275
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,670
No need to bother you.

276
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,710
Save it!

277
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,710
Enough!

278
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,640
No need to make a fuss.

279
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,350
He's just drunk.

280
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,440
Do you know what your brother has done

281
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,400
in the imperial palace?

282
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,110
What?

283
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
He's a well-known poetic genius now.

284
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,790
His Majesty ordered

285
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,280
the imperial guards

286
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,400
to escort His Excellency Fan home.

287
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,150
His Majesty also asked us

288
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,280
to take good care of him.

289
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,400
Now,

290
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,470
he is the treasure of

291
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,550
Nanqing.

292
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,790
You really flatter him.

293
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,110
I mean it.

294
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
Your Excellency, you don't know.

295
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Mr. Fan composed poems

296
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,430
out of drunkenness tonight.

297
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,040
Everyone in the Hall

298
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,310
was stunned and startled.

299
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,070
Many said in private that

300
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,920
he's really a poetic genius sent from heaven.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,680
Look at your brother Fan Xian.

302
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,560
He's such a promising young man.

303
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,590
Look at you! You only want to sleep.

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,350
Just learn from your brother.

305
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,430
Isn't he also sleeping now?

306
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
He...

307
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,560
Ask them to leave.

308
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,760
You are different!

309
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,190
Get up!

310
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,110
It's late.

311
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,880
Go back and rest.

312
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,950
I'll take care of my bother.

313
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,070
No need to rest.

314
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,230
He's become a well-known genius.

315
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,920
We should take good care of him.

316
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,190
Make some midnight snacks in case that

317
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,760
he wants something to eat after waking up.

318
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,430
Come on!

319
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,040
Hurry up!

320
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,640
Enough!

321
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,920
Just leave.

322
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,190
Brother needs to rest.

323
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,230
Go! Go! Leave now!

324
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,920
Let him have a good rest.

325
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,280
Be quiet! Be quiet!

326
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,470
It's time to go.

327
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,310
Let your brother have a good rest.

328
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,190
Hurry up!

329
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,560
We should leave early.

330
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,680
Brother.

331
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,430
Brother, are you OK?

332
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm fine.

333
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,520
Did Zhuang Mohan really spit blood?

334
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,350
Yes.

335
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,400
After tonight,

336
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,310
Fan Xian will be known as a poetic genius.

337
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,920
In this case,

338
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,040
Zhuang Mohan has made a lie to frame Fan Xian up.

339
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,070
His good reputation over seventy years

340
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,160
was ruined over one night.

341
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,160
He actually ruined his life

342
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,640
at such an old age.

343
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,590
Well, I'm also tired.

344
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,230
We'll talk tomorrow.

345
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,280
Haven't you taken the medicine?

346
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
It helps to vomit.

347
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,680
Ruoruo,

348
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,400
some people in the imperial court

349
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,070
have conspired with Zhuang Mohan.

350
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,760
What happened today is a setup.

351
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,400
Who might they be?

352
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,640
The Princess Royal and Guo Youzhi.

353
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,230
The Princess Royal?

354
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,830
Didn't she defend you

355
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,110
all the time in the Hall?

356
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,190
You're a smart girl.

357
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,680
How can you fall for her trick?

358
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,190
She is really insidious.

359
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,800
I'll sneak into the imperial palace tonight.

360
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,070
But brother, you're too drunk.

361
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,310
Because I'm drunk,

362
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,560
no one will suspect me.

363
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,400
Ruoruo,

364
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,110
guard the room for me.

365
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,160
Don't let anyone in.

366
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,950
I know.

367
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,160
As long as I'm alive,

368
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,430
no one can get in.

369
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,470
Your Excellency.

370
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,640
Wait here.

371
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,000
Uncle.

372
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,230
The plan remains unchanged.

373
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,920
We've got about half an hour.

374
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,590
I'll lure Hong Sixiang away,

375
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,190
and you shall sneak inside to get the key.

376
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,760
Wait!

377
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,800
What's wrong?

378
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,310
You'd better not betray your identity.

379
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,230
I stole the clothes and sword

380
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,800
from the mission of

381
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Dongyi Town.

382
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,800
Yun Zhilan?

383
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,520
There're only a few Ninth Dan martial arts masters

384
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,920
in the capital city.

385
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,760
I want them to think that

386
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,230
the first apprentice of Si Gujian is the one

387
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,000
who sneaks into the imperial palace.

388
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,950
So you've got a plan.

389
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,800
I often sneaked into places

390
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,710
with your mom

391
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,760
back then.

392
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,710
I'm used to that.

393
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Be careful yourself.

394
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,710
You may not be able to

395
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,590
stop Yan Xiaoyi's arrows.

396
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,000
The imperial harem is so big.

397
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,190
I may not run into him.

398
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
After writing down so many poems,

399
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,950
your hand must be sore.

400
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,920
Now that there's good news from our literary circles,

401
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,590
it's a happy event rarely seen.

402
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,710
Even if my hand would be broken
for writing down the poems,

403
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,350
I still feel happy from the bottom of my heart.

404
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,710
Your Majesty, are you tired?

405
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,470
I just feel emotional.

406
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,520
Nanqing was founded with military forces.

407
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,590
When it comes to civil administration,

408
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,350
we're far behind compared to Beiqi.

409
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,560
The late emperor

410
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,110
was deeply concerned about it at heart.

411
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,880
God blesses Nanqing.

412
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,830
Now we have Mr. Fan, the poetic genius.

413
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,560
Poetic genius?

414
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,680
Or may be a lost genius?

415
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,230
But the poems

416
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,350
are really good.

417
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,280
But I'm wondering

418
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,590
whether he wrote them or not.

419
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,430
=Hong Sixiang, Head of Eunuchs of Nanqing=

420
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:34,580
=Hong Sixiang, Head of Eunuchs of Nanqing=
Who are you?

421
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,760
Who are you?

422
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,310
Sorry, it's a mistake.

423
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,400
I've taken the wrong way.

424
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,590
Taking a wrong way to the imperial palace,

425
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,560
you must be the first one

426
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,280
in the world.

427
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,070
I have to work for my country.

428
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,430
Please forgive me.

429
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,830
I'll leave at once.

430
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,760
Lad, this is the imperial palace.

431
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,880
It's not up to you

432
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,350
to leave.

433
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,430
Front!

434
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Back!

435
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,160
You're an apprentice of Si Gujian.

436
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,700
=Yan Xiaoyi, Director of Imperial Guards of Nanqing=

437
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,800
Director Yan, what's wrong?

438
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,520
Have you heard anything?

439
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,800
No.

440
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,760
Get me my bow.

441
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,680
Yes.

442
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,590
Judged from our experience in the Taiping Residence,

443
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,350
Yan Xiaoyi has exceptionally good hearing.

444
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,560
If you get close,

445
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,950
he'll notice whenever you go wrong.

446
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,920
When you enter the imperial palace,

447
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,000
don't run or jump.

448
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,470
Director Yan, is there anything wrong?

449
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,310
Nothing sounds strange.

450
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,920
The leopard cats kept by the imperial consorts

451
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,070
are really fat.

452
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,760
They might cause the sound

453
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,800
just now.

454
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,040
Keep patrolling.

455
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,230
Yes.

456
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,040
Another thing you should be cautious about.

457
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,400
Never go high.

458
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,800
That's right.

459
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,230
Besides his good hearing,

460
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,760
Yan Xiaoyi is an archer.

461
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,400
For archers, their eyes are the best.

462
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,760
If I go high,

463
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,040
thought it's late at night,

464
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,880
he might still see me.

465
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,520
Wang Qinian.

466
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,680
Your Excellency.

467
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,190
Get me the locksmith.

468
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,830
Just copy this key.

469
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,230
It's not a key.

470
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,280
There's no such key

471
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,800
or such lock in the world.

472
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,800
You're fooled?

473
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,000
Whatever it is,

474
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,880
can you make a copy?

475
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,280
Ingenious as it is,

476
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,040
it takes time.

477
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,950
Just make a general model.

478
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,110
No need to focus on the details.

479
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,680
Do it roughly?

480
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,040
Right. How long will it take?

481
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,680
Without paying attention to the details,

482
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,110
it'll take about fifteen minutes.

483
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,520
Wait a moment.

484
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,880
I need to pee. I need to pee.

485
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,070
Go ahead. Go ahead.

486
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,800
What're you staring at?

487
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,160
Let me tell you.

488
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,800
Just now, a weirdo

489
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,950
fell from here

490
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,000
to the ground.

491
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,800
The he stepped onto an umbrella

492
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,710
and flied away.

493
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,800
Then an old eunuch

494
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,560
flied through the air like an arrow.

495
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,920
Like an arrow.

496
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,110
Look, the floor tiles are broken.

497
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,110
This is the fake one.

498
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,110
And this is the real one.

499
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,070
Thank you.

500
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,400
Who said it's a key?

501
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,710
What lock can it open?

502
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,950
Stop asking so many questions.

503
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,710
Yes.

504
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,560
Your Excellency.

505
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,590
No need to follow me.

506
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll put the fake one back.

507
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,110
After that, I'll go back myself.

508
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,280
OK.

509
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,640
Your Excellency, this is a top secret, right?

510
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,000
I trust you.

511
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,310
Well, how should we deal with the locksmith?

512
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,800
What do you mean?

513
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,950
Should we get rid of him?

514
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,230
We only asked him to make a key.

515
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,110
No need to kill him for that.

516
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,830
Give him a good pay

517
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,040
and send him out of the capital city tonight.

518
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,920
Ask him to stay outside for a while.

519
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,710
Are you testing me?

520
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,520
Your Excellency, you're bold

521
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,830
but soft-hearted.

522
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,800
Is that a good thing?

523
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,190
If you want to do great things,

524
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,000
you're too merciful.

525
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,350
But you'll make a good friend.

526
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
Your Excellency, there's one more thing.

527
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,350
Go ahead.

528
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,190
Since you want to give him a good pay,

529
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,710
you should give me the money.

530
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,280
Where can I get money

531
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,070
for you late at night?

532
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,070
Pay it for me now.

533
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,800
Your Excellency,

534
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,230
can you write me

535
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,950
a loan receipt

536
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,880
so that I can

537
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,000
gain some interests.

538
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,190
Fuck off!

539
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,280
Your Excellency, please be careful.

540
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,280
Everything goes on smoothly this time.

541
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
After putting back the fake key,

542
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,830
we can complete the mission successfully.

543
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,040
I just hope there will be no accident.

544
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,560
Avoid trouble

545
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,920
and don't raise new issues.

546
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,470
You should be fine.

547
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,390
The Princess Royal is waiting for you inside.

548
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,150
Your Highness.

549
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,760
If love between both sides can last for aye,

550
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,560
why need they stay together night and day?

551
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,600
Love is depicted so well
that it almost makes me heartbroken.

552
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,390
Take a seat.

553
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,800
I had copied some of Fan Xian's poems

554
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,870
on the banquet.

555
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,280
Even now,

556
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,150
those poems seem marvelous.

557
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,320
What do you think?

558
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,390
Indeed.

559
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,600
The poems are amazing.

560
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,000
Can there really be a fairyland

561
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,080
in the world?

562
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,390
Fairyland is purely imaginary.

563
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
I actually think

564
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,710
these poems

565
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,390
are written by Mr. Fan himself.

566
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,950
Writing hundreds of excellent poems without a break,

567
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,120
it's beyond common sense.

568
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,870
Is he really a genius

569
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,840
descended from heaven?

570
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,910
If he's a genius descended from heaven,

571
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,910
then he's definitely

572
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,520
a poetic genius.

573
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,840
I summoned you tonight

574
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,910
to ask you something.

575
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,670
You promised me to

576
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,910
humiliate Fan Xian

577
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,670
and ruin his name on the banquet.

578
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,190
Have you lived up to your word?

579
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,870
I framed Fan Xian up today

580
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,910
at the cost of my good reputation.

581
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,150
Though I've lost,

582
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,520
I'm utterly convinced.

583
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,600
But there's one thing I don't understand.

584
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,430
Your Highness didn't tell me in advance that

585
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,000
Fan Xian is a poetic genius,

586
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,080
or I wouldn't have made

587
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,710
a fool of myself.

588
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,870
I didn't expect that

589
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,230
he's so genius.

590
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,430
That's fine.

591
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,950
You lost. How can it be fine?

592
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,600
Luckily he wrote

593
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,710
over one hundred poems overnight.

594
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,280
Otherwise,

595
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,280
the world

596
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,120
would be misled by me

597
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,760
and think him as

598
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,870
a shameless person

599
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,280
who copied other's work.

600
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,870
He's unharmed,

601
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,080
but your reputation is completely ruined.

602
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,910
That's better than

603
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,710
feeling guilty all my life.

604
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,470
You're relieved. What about me?

605
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,710
Thanks to me, you caught Yan Bingyun

606
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,630
to exchange Xiao En back to Beiqi.

607
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,870
In the world, how many people know

608
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,360
the vicious villain Xiao En

609
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,230
is actually the younger brother of

610
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,630
the literary giant Zhuang Mohan?

611
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,080
I helped you and Beiqi

612
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,190
in defiance of world opinions.

613
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,190
I did you such a big favor,

614
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,390
only to be told that

615
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,430
you are relieved.

616
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
If I were not trapped by family affection,

617
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,040
how would I come to Nanqing

618
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,320
and fall into your trap?

619
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,520
Go back

620
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,870
and tell that little emperor of yours.

621
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,430
He owes me.

622
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,190
He'll have to pay me back in future.

623
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm confused about one thing.

624
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,040
Young and talented

625
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,870
as Fan Xian is,

626
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,040
he will be the pillar of Nanqing

627
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,080
in future.

628
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,800
Your Highness,

629
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,910
why do you have to kill him?

630
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,230
You even gave away

631
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,120
the secret agent of your Investigator's Office!

632
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,950
Yan Bingyun did suffer a little,

633
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,520
but he's still alive.

634
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,910
As to why I have to

635
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,840
kill Fan Xian,

636
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,430
I just love to see him

637
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,840
helpless.

638
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,280
There's an assassin!

639
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,870
Did it miss?

640
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,630
The arrowhead is broken,

641
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,630
and there are scraps of clothes.

642
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,600
He must be shot.

643
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:28,840
There's no blood.

644
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,430
Is he unharmed?

645
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,840
Whoever shot by me must be injured.

646
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,840
Split up and search for him carefully.

647
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,910
Yes.

648
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,820
In the river of history,

649
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,020
time goes round and round.

650
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,380
Memories about the former and present lives

651
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,260
join each other in an endless way.

652
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,860
In the long drunken Milky Way,

653
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,580
one season follows another in a flash,

654
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,780
and the wild geese are flying south.

655
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,700
I just can't give up

656
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,700
to be with you for my whole life.

657
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,980
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

658
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,780
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

659
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,660
Year after year in the wandering,

660
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,220
I count the remaining years.

661
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,420
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

662
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,980
even though we have ended up the destiny,

663
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,660
I never feel regretful.

664
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,620
In such a chaotic world,

665
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,380
I still miss you as ever.

666
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,020
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

667
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,740
With a gentle heart,

668
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,300
I cherish our remaining years.

669
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,140
Even though we have to go through

670
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,100
all the hardships along the journey,

671
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:29,420
you always stay by my side,

672
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,180
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

673
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,100
Year after year in the wandering,

674
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,460
I count the remaining years.

675
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,820
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

676
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,620
even though we end up the destiny,

677
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,060
I never feel regretful.

678
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,980
In such a chaotic world,

679
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,940
I still miss you as ever.

680
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,620
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

681
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,380
With a gentle heart,

682
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,780
I cherish our remaining years.

683
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,580
Even though we have to go through

684
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,740
all the hardships along the journey,

685
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:10,020
you always stay by my side...
