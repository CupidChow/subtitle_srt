1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 18

16
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,230
But I'm willing to marry him.

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
You're deceived by

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,120
the sweet words of that brat.

19
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,630
He really has a glib tongue

20
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,870
and doesn't behave seriously sometimes,

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,910
but the expression in his eyes is really pure.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,040
Second brother,

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,510
I don't know what has happened

24
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,870
between you two,

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,760
but he is definitely not a flibbertigibbet.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,480
What kind of man he is

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,360
doesn't matter now.

28
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,310
Maybe he is a good man,

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,230
or maybe as you say,

30
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,830
he is sincere.

31
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,830
But he isn't supposed to come to the capital city.

32
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,830
Many people have been staring at him.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
What do you mean?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wan'er, our family owes you a lot.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,160
Sometimes,

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,830
I don't really know

37
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,470
how I can make it up to you.

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
Second brother, you've always been kind to me.

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,000
I know that in my heart.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,630
Dad seldom comes to see you

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,720
for the sake of the overall situation and our family.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,190
I understand.

43
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,030
But sometimes I couldn't help wondering.

44
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,520
If we can't protect our family members,

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,750
what's the meaning of maintaining the glory of our family?

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
I don't allow you to marry him

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,240
for fear that he might get you into trouble.

48
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,960
I just want to protect you.

49
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,440
I'll leave this to you.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,160
Don't let him see you ever again.

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,320
Brother.

52
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,480
Lin Gong is the one who wants to kill me.

53
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,920
The Second Young Master? Why?

54
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,550
Is he a follower of the Crown Prince,

55
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,720
or is it about the financial power of the Neiku?

56
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,480
Nobody has ever asked me!

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,350
Nobody! Never!

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,350
They just want the financial power of the Neiku, right?

59
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,550
I'll give it to them.

60
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,920
I never want it myself.

61
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,950
They can just ask,

62
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,880
but they actually chose to kill people!

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,510
Why did you

64
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,600
make a fuss

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
at the imperial residence just now?

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,350
I broke into the imperial residence

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,480
to offer him a chance to kill me.

68
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
I've noticed that his subordinates

69
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,110
are all martial arts masters of and above the Seventh Dan.

70
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,760
They are strong enough

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,920
to capture Cheng Jushu.

72
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,600
Later, I visited Ye Ling'er.

73
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,760
From her,

74
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,110
I confirmed that Lin Gong is the real killer.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
So Lin Gong follows the Crown Prince?

76
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,270
Now, I have no evidence to prove that

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,160
the Crown Prince is involved.

78
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
So for now,

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,350
Lin Gong is my only revenge target.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,070
When will you take a move?

81
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Quick-tempered as I am, I can hardly wait.

82
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,510
I'll kill him tonight.

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,760
Didn't you just say that

84
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,880
he's surrounded by martial arts masters?

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,640
I still have to go!

86
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,670
Only to avenge Teng Zijing's death?

87
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,040
I do it for Teng Zijing,

88
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,070
but not only

89
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,200
for him.

90
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,040
Who else?

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
Ruoruo, look!

92
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,550
Most people in the world

93
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
are ordinary, just like them.

94
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,110
But there're always some theories,

95
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,200
some big potatoes

96
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,880
that regard them as insignificant.

97
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
He's dead, but he's just a guard.

98
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
I've heard that so many times.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,070
Ruoruo, I enjoy crowds.

100
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,670
I think that without the ordinary people,

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,200
Nanqing won't exist.

102
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,440
Nor will the world.

103
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,160
Pick me something fat.

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,950
Look at this. And this.

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,670
I made it! I made it!

106
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,830
So I want to fight

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,950
with the hows and whys in the world

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,950
and tell those big potatoes that

109
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,270
ordinary people are important.

110
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,270
Brother,

111
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,670
you only think about them.

112
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,390
Why don't you think about yourself?

113
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,160
About what?

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,320
Lin Gong is the elder brother of Lin Wan'er,

115
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,880
just like us.

116
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,320
If someday,

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,510
Lin Wan'er kills me,

118
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,670
will you still marry her?

119
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,510
I know you want to revenge.

120
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,790
You refuse to accept what has happened.

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,950
I understand it all, so I won't stop you.

122
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,160
But you must understand that

123
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,160
if you kill Lin Gong yourself,

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
there will be no future

125
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,070
for Wan'er and you.

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
Then shall I give up

127
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
and let Teng Zijing die in vain?

128
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,440
I don't know, either.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,270
But you can't have both.

130
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,110
I know it's hard.

131
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,480
But brother,

132
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,510
you must make the choice yourself.

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,790
Ruoruo, please go back first.

134
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,200
I want to be alone.

135
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,670
Did your second brother really

136
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,840
try to kill Fan Xian

137
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,350
this afternoon?

138
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,150
He hates Fan Xian so much that

139
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,640
he can't be persuaded.

140
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,080
He values you deeply.

141
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,110
But he saw Fan Xian sneaking into your room

142
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,710
without considering your reputation.

143
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,440
It's understandable that

144
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,030
he went mad.

145
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,030
But I just feel that

146
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,760
something has happened

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,670
between Fan Xian and him.

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,230
If there are

149
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,880
some insoluble contradictions

150
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,230
between your family member

151
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
and the man you love.

152
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,350
Who will you choose?

153
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,350
I...

154
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't know.

155
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,710
As an illegitimate daughter,

156
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,670
I should avoid seeing my father and mother,

157
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,350
nor should I expect any family affection.

158
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,640
But in these years,

159
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,110
my second brother Lin Gong is
the only one who treats me nicely.

160
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,710
Whenever he saw

161
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,960
something fresh and interesting,

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,110
he would bring it to me,

163
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,230
for fear that I might feel bored

164
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,640
in the room.

165
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,280
He makes me feel warm.

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,350
He's really kind to me.

167
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,150
But as to Fan Xian,

168
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,150
I originally thought

169
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,400
I would marry someone I don't love,

170
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,350
and we would respect each other like guests.

171
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,710
But unexpectedly,

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,590
I actually met him

173
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,000
by fate.

174
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
In my heart,

175
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,760
he's the right man for me.

176
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,030
So emotionally,

177
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,590
I will take no side.

178
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,200
If one of them

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,670
really made a mistake...

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
Who will you choose?

181
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,670
I only hope that

182
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,080
there is justice in the world.

183
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,440
Brother,

184
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,590
I know you want to revenge.

185
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,960
You refuse to accept what has happened.

186
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,030
I understand it all, so I won't stop you.

187
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,000
But you must understand that

188
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,110
if you kill Lin Gong yourself,

189
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
there will be no future

190
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,110
for Wan'er and you.

191
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
=Wuzhu, servant of Fan Xian's late mother=

192
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,280
Uncle Wuzhu.

193
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,640
Go back.

194
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,910
Lin Gong planned the assassination on the Niulan Street.

195
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,440
Teng Zijing died a grim death because of me.

196
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,230
I know.

197
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,760
I want to kill him.

198
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,280
You're hesitant.

199
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,080
I'm not.

200
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm the one that he wants to kill!

201
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,000
Teng Zijing died for me!

202
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,000
I have to kill him.

203
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,760
You're utterly confused!

204
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,840
If you go now, you'll get yourself killed.

205
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,350
Uncle, step aside.

206
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,280
Go back.

207
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,670
So do you also think that

208
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,550
Teng Zijing's death

209
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,760
means nothing?

210
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,710
Yes.

211
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,470
Then so be it!

212
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
You've made some progress,

213
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,350
but you still lack patience.

214
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,030
Uncle Wuzhu?

215
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,470
Uncle Wuzhu?

216
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,960
Uncle Wuzhu?

217
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,400
Brother, what's up?

218
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,320
Where's Uncle Wuzhu?

219
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,640
Uncle Wuzhu?

220
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,320
The man who helped you in Danzhou?

221
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,000
I haven't seen him.

222
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
Why am I home?

223
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,760
What's the matter?

224
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,710
Brother, where are you going?

225
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,470
To kill Lin Gong.

226
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,080
He's left.

227
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,880
This morning,

228
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,640
Lin Gong left the city in a hurry.

229
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,590
How do you know that?

230
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,960
Ye Ling'er from the Ye mansion came to see you.

231
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,150
She brought the news.

232
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,110
Where does Lin Gong go?

233
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,550
She didn't mention that.

234
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Kill him.

235
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,840
No one can see my face.

236
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,200
What are you doing?

237
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,200
What are you doing?

238
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,110
Wait! My sheep!

239
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,150
Has Lin Gong left?

240
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,150
Yes.

241
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,640
He left the city with many guards.

242
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,670
Do you know where he is heading for?

243
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,880
I don't know.

244
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,030
But I know that

245
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,840
he visited the Crown Prince before leaving.

246
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,840
Then he went back to the Lin mansion.

247
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,960
After a few minutes,

248
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,150
he got on a carriage and left in a hurry.

249
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,470
So the Crown Prince

250
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,470
is also involved.

251
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
How do you know it so clearly?

252
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,760
I visited Wan'er

253
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
and talked with her yesterday.

254
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,840
What did you tell her?

255
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,640
Don't worry.

256
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,710
I said nothing

257
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,440
about Lin Gong.

258
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,000
I just come around myself.

259
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,000
Will you inform the Investigator's Office of

260
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,710
his collusion with the enemies

261
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,760
and testify against him?

262
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,440
No way!

263
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,880
The Crown Prince is involved after all,

264
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,640
I can't drag my family into this.

265
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,670
Then there's no way out.

266
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,200
Si Lili's testimony alone

267
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,030
won't be able to prove Lin Gong guilty.

268
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,350
Though I can't

269
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,520
put my family at risk,

270
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,280
I won't just

271
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,840
watch Beiqi harm Nanqing

272
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,880
and do nothing.

273
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,640
Since you can catch Si Lili,

274
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,590
you must be able to

275
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,840
find Lin Gong.

276
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,000
I hope you can find him back

277
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,350
and figure out the whole thing.

278
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,320
If he really colluded with the
enemies and betrayed our country,

279
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,520
His Majesty will punish him.

280
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,840
Thanks for your information.

281
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,840
But he's gone already. How can we catch him?

282
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,710
I know a guy

283
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,590
who's good at hunting people.

284
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,280
This yard is secluded.

285
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,830
Let's sleep here tonight.

286
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,520
Tomorrow, we'll find a boat and go south.

287
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,640
Yes.

288
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,430
Second Young Master,

289
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,760
where are we going

290
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,160
exactly?

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,040
Nowhere specific.

292
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,350
After all, I only have to hide for now.

293
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,800
Second Young Master,

294
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,400
what do you have to hide from

295
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,880
in the capital city?

296
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,040
We must start from the Prime Minister's mansion.

297
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,470
The impresses of carriages are different.

298
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,950
Only by searching from the start

299
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,280
can we find a trace.

300
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,190
I've been thinking recently.

301
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,760
You might have flaws,

302
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,560
but capable as you are,

303
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,470
how come you're just a clerk?

304
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,800
I just seek ease and comfort.

305
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,560
Then you should never follow me.

306
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,070
In these days,

307
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,710
what I did

308
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,920
is extremely dangerous.

309
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,760
Your Excellency, you're generous after all.

310
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,800
Don't mention the money.

311
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,560
It's only an excuse.

312
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,070
We both know that

313
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,070
you follow me for some other reasons.

314
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,070
The Prime Minister's mansion is right ahead.

315
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,950
I won't ask if you don't want to say.

316
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,470
I've met you.

317
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,640
You're the subordinate of Chengze.

318
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,470
Distinguished as His Highness is,

319
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,710
how dare you call him like that!

320
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,950
I won't next time. See you.

321
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,830
His Highness wants to see you.

322
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,310
I have something urgent to deal with.

323
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,590
I'll ask for his forgiveness in person some other day.

324
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,400
His Highness is nearby.

325
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,430
After sitting on the carriage for so long,

326
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
it feels good to walk around.

327
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,920
By the way,

328
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,310
I'll think about our route to the south.

329
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,800
Since we're leaving the capital city,

330
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,920
we can visit some people.

331
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,160
Second Young Master,

332
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,640
a blind man at the door wants to see you.

333
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,160
A blind man?

334
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,800
Can he practice martial arts?

335
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,430
He doesn't have any vitality qi.

336
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,710
Let him in.

337
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,520
Everyone, watch out! Prepare to attack at any time!

338
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,400
Go by yourself.

339
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
Your Excellency, please go ahead.

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,430
Though I've read the Red Mansions for several times,

341
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,640
I'm still fond of reading it.

342
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,880
Have you read it?

343
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
Why are you reading here?

344
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,000
Cross ventilation

345
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,950
makes it shady and cool here.

346
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,590
It's really a good place for reading at noon.

347
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,590
The beauty of the capital city

348
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,400
lies not in various mansions,

349
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
but in streets and alleys.

350
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
It does have a distinctive flavor.

351
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
Your Highness, do you think I'm silly?

352
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,520
Why do you say so?

353
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
Your Highness, you find a place

354
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,710
to enjoy the cool and read the book when you're free.

355
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,920
And I happen to be around.

356
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,070
How silly am I

357
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,070
to believe this crap?

358
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,350
You're right.

359
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm actually waiting for you.

360
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,880
Are you looking for Lin Gong?

361
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,920
How do you know?

362
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,400
This morning,

363
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,520
Lin Gong and the Crown Prince met at the Eastern Palace

364
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,520
and had a quarrel.

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,110
Your name was heard vaguely

366
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,000
outside the study.

367
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,710
Then Lin Gong left the capital in a hurry.

368
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,710
So I wait for you near the Prime Minister's mansion.

369
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,950
And you really show up.

370
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
Your Highness, how can you know

371
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,070
what happened in the Eastern Palace?

372
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,040
I sure have spies there.

373
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,070
Is it appropriate to tell me that?

374
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,280
It doesn't matter.

375
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,680
It's not a secret.

376
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,430
I've also got spies from the Crown Prince around me.

377
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,400
How loving and touching

378
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,430
you are!

379
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
No one but you

380
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,040
has ever talked to me like that.

381
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,310
Your Highness, are you waiting for me here

382
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,710
to tell me that?

383
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,400
I'm asking you,

384
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,920
are you looking for Lin Gong?

385
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,590
Yes.

386
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,000
I won't ask you why.

387
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,680
I only ask you,

388
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,640
will there be a fight?

389
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,040
Yes.

390
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,520
This morning, Lin Gong left

391
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,310
with many guards.

392
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,110
They are all martial arts masters.

393
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,760
Do you know that?

394
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,880
I know. They are masters of or above the Seventh Dan.

395
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,710
Can you defeat them?

396
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,350
Not really.

397
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Xie Bi'an is known as

398
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,800
"Faster than Light."

399
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,070
He is the best swordsman

400
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,110
in the capital city.

401
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,830
Faster than light?

402
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,000
Fast sword.
('fast sword' is a homophone for 'express' in Chinese)

403
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,400
I know S.F. Express for being fast.

404
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,680
You actually

405
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,590
understand swordsmanship!

406
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
To attack fast,

407
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,430
besides a flexible figure,

408
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,640
you must borrow the power of nature.

409
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,520
Attacking with the wind will sure make a difference.
('with the wind' is a homophone for 'S.F. Express' in Chinese)

410
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,470
Unbelievable!

411
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,000
With Xie Bi'an by your side,

412
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,110
you might stand a chance.

413
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,640
Your Highness, why do you help me?

414
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,350
I appreciate your talents.

415
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,640
Also, if you marry Wan'er,

416
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,710
you'll take over the Neiku.

417
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,470
I'm friendly with you

418
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,040
for the sake of the properties.

419
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,640
I really appreciate

420
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,520
your frankness.

421
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,430
But this time,

422
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,560
no need to bother Mr. Xie.

423
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,470
Then be careful yourself.

424
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,470
Your Highness, aren't you angry?

425
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,000
It's perfectly justifiable to choose the Crown Prince.

426
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,470
It makes sense that you don't choose me.

427
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,400
Why should I be angry?

428
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,190
Compared to the Crown Prince,

429
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,040
I think Your Highness stand a better chance.

430
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,000
If you have time, we can meet more often.

431
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,070
We won't talk about national affairs, but romance.

432
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,190
Who are you?

433
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,710
How do you find me?

434
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,590
Lin Gong.

435
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,520
How dare you!

436
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
How can you call the Second Young Master

437
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,590
by his name?

438
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,070
Everything is related.

439
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,230
You want to kill Fan Xian, so I will kill you.

440
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,310
Kill him!

441
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,640
Second Young Master,

442
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,520
shall we ask who sent him?

443
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
After killing him,

444
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,590
the man behind him is sure to show up.

445
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,470
Bury him.

446
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,430
Actually, I only want to kill you.

447
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,710
Kill him!

448
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,710
I'm the son of the Prime Minster

449
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,640
and the follower of the Crown Prince.

450
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,310
Whatever you want,

451
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,310
I can give it to you.

452
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,830
A martial arts master as you are,

453
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,950
I can promise you a bright future.

454
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,830
No matter what...

455
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,950
Your Excellency,

456
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,560
the Second Prince really thinks highly of you.

457
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,310
Indeed.

458
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,110
Are you unwilling

459
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,280
to follow him?

460
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,800
I've been to that alley when I was free.

461
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,190
There were many street vendors

462
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,800
and fried cake stands on the road.

463
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,280
Today, they are all driven away

464
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,640
simply because he wants to enjoy the cool.

465
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
One day without income.

466
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,110
What's wrong with that?

467
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,520
If people are born with nobleness and lowliness,

468
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,350
there's nothing wrong.

469
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,590
Forget it.

470
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,590
The Lin mansion is right ahead.

471
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,310
Are you confident in finding Lin Gong?

472
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,110
They just left today, so the impressions are new.

473
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,800
Finding Lin Gong

474
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,950
is as easy as winking.

475
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,070
Your Excellency, come with me.

476
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,640
The road is actually covered with flagstones!

477
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,400
What's wrong with that?

478
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,920
Then there wouldn't be any impressions.

479
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,560
Your Excellency,

480
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,310
there's still another way.

481
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,520
Ling Gong left with many subordinates.

482
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,190
Someone must have seen them.

483
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,950
Let's inquire about them

484
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,430
along the road.

485
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,590
We might get some information.

486
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,950
There's no time.

487
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,710
We've wasted so much time,

488
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,590
I'm afraid Lin Gong

489
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,830
might have gone away.

490
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
=Lin Gong and his guards have been
killed at the suburb of the capital city.=

491
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,400
Your Excellency, where are we going?

492
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,000
We're leaving the city.

493
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:17,880
Find him.

494
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,280
He's dead.

495
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,110
Your Excellency, he's dead.

496
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,230
Here he is!

497
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,110
It's really Lin Gong.

498
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,520
How do you get the information?

499
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,920
It just appeared on my desk

500
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,520
out of nowhere.

501
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,800
I followed the lead

502
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,400
and found him there.

503
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,070
Have you got anything from the handwriting?

504
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,430
The handwriting is too neat. It's hard to find any clue.

505
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,350
I just don't get it.

506
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,350
Lin Gong was killed.

507
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,880
Why did the killer give us the address

508
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,000
to collect the body?

509
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,920
Judged from Lin Gong's wounds,

510
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,590
they might be caused by sword.

511
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,640
Then let's investigate

512
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,400
the swordsmen who have been in and out of

513
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,830
the capital city in recent days.

514
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,230
The killer is highly skilled.

515
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,800
Only one man is so good at sword

516
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,070
both in and out of the capital city.

517
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,230
Who is that?

518
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,640
Xie Bi'an,

519
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,430
the follower of the Second Prince.

520
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,350
Lin Gong is the follower of the Crown Prince.

521
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,950
Let's submit a secret memorial to the imperial palace,

522
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,760
and let His Majesty make the call.

523
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,760
It's the only way.

524
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,710
The capital city will soon descend into chaos.

525
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,230
Are you hungry?

526
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,590
I've asked the kitchen cook

527
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,640
to make the pastries for you.

528
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,190
Take it as the midnight snack.

529
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,160
You have something for me.

530
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,470
No.

531
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,310
Brother, don't get me wrong.

532
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,560
I haven't seen you

533
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,710
for days.

534
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,950
I really miss you.

535
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,400
You usually call me by my name.

536
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,880
Brother, here is the thing.

537
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,230
I've find a place for our shop.

538
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,350
We'll employ servants

539
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,800
from our mansion.

540
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,590
So we can open the shop

541
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,680
in just a few days.

542
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,760
You still remember it?

543
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,880
Of course, I do.

544
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,350
It will make a huge profit.

545
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,000
How can I forget?

546
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,920
Brother,

547
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,640
are you still writing the Red Mansions?

548
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,230
How should we

549
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,400
name the shop?

550
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,470
Why do you look at me like that?

551
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,160
Did I say anything wrong?

552
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,310
Uncle...

553
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,680
Right! The book.
('book' is a homophone for 'uncle' in Chinese)

554
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,880
Just keep writing.

555
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,040
Don't...

556
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,760
He's fine. He just passed out.

557
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,110
Tell me!

558
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,160
After knocking me out last night,

559
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,590
where did you go?

560
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,110
Do you know that

561
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,830
he might have ran away

562
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,470
during that moment?

563
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,800
I killed Lin Gong.

564
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,070
I followed him out of the city

565
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,470
and killed him.

566
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,430
If you want to kill him,

567
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,760
then why did you stop me last night?

568
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,760
Because you were hesitant.

569
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,070
You were utterly confused.

570
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,800
Who gave you the right to kill him?

571
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,880
Your mom did.

572
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,160
If you can't make the call,

573
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,640
I'll make it for you.

574
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,590
You always say so.

575
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,590
You were hesitant to kill him,

576
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,070
so I would kill him for you.

577
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,880
-You always say that! -Whoever wants to kill you,

578
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll kill him.

579
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,400
You always say that!

580
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,310
Then where were you

581
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,310
when I was assassinated

582
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:25,920
on the Niulan Street?

583
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,310
Where were you

584
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,310
when someone tried to kill me?

585
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,280
I was not in the capital city

586
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,000
when the assassination took place.

587
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,160
I'm sorry.

588
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,280
It won't happen again.

589
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,830
Sir! Sir!

590
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,280
Please show mercy!

591
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,640
Thank you! Thank you!

592
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,160
Thank you! Thank you!

593
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,120
You're not in the capital city recently.

594
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,800
Where have you been?

595
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,910
I went to the Jiangnan area.

596
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,600
Why did you go there?

597
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,560
Do you still have your mom's box?

598
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,080
I want to open the box

599
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,320
left by your mom,

600
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,870
but I can't remember the past clearly.

601
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,150
I only remember that the key should be in the capital city,

602
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,630
but I can't remember the exact place.

603
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
If the key is in the capital city,

604
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,520
why did you go to the Jiangnan area?

605
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,630
I remember vaguely that

606
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,520
your mom and I talked about the box

607
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,950
in the Jiangnan area.

608
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,000
So I revisited the places

609
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,360
to see

610
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,950
whether I can remember something or not.

611
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,320
Have you got any clue?

612
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,520
Yes.

613
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,760
Now I've confirmed that

614
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,910
the key to the box

615
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,230
might be kept in two places.

616
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,910
It might be kept in the palace.

617
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,710
The imperial palace?

618
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,520
Right.

619
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,230
We can search for it if we have time.

620
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,630
Uncle,

621
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,520
the imperial palace is filled with martial arts masters.

622
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,560
And you said yourself that

623
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,150
one of the Four Great Masters

624
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,360
might be there.

625
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,320
If we don't know

626
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,280
who he really is,

627
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,670
it might be dangerous.

628
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,040
If he's really in the imperial palace,

629
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,470
he might be that old eunuch

630
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,760
surnamed Hong.

631
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,950
Hong Sixiang?

632
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,760
Can we sneak into the imperial palace

633
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,120
without being noticed by him?

634
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,760
Probably not. We have to break in.

635
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,600
Then tell me

636
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,280
the other place.

637
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,000
The key

638
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,710
might be kept

639
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,950
where your mom once lived.

640
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,840
Does it have a name?

641
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,280
Taiping Residence.

642
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,950
Where is it?

643
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,800
Somewhere near the capital city.

644
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,630
What's the exact location?

645
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,840
I can't remember.

646
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,430
Help me find it.

647
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,800
OK.

648
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,280
I have to ask my father.

649
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,840
Don't let Fan Jian know I'm back.

650
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,430
OK.

651
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,670
That's all for now.

652
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,360
Find the Taiping Residence as soon as possible.

653
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,910
I'll stay in the capital city these days.

654
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
Where are you staying?

655
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,280
Uncle?

656
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,230
Uncle?

657
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,840
Uncle,

658
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,520
next time you leave,

659
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,910
just let me know.

660
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,080
Fine.

661
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,950
Sister.

662
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,150
Why did I sleep on the floor

663
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
of your room

664
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,230
last night?

665
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,470
I don't know.

666
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,840
Do you know

667
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,430
I came to see you last night?

668
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,320
I don't remember.

669
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,080
Is our mansion haunted?

670
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,630
Come to my study.

671
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,600
Who?

672
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,430
Me.

673
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,000
I also finished eating.

674
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,230
Mom,

675
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,040
since Fan Xian

676
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,390
came to our mansion,

677
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,760
Dad seldom

678
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
finds fault with me.

679
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,520
He has nothing to say to you.

680
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,600
It's not a good thing.

681
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,910
Mom,

682
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,430
this is not what we should

683
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,600
be worried about now.

684
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,190
What we should be worried about the most

685
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,040
is that our mansion is haunted.

686
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,560
Oh my God!

687
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,040
How come I have such a son?!

688
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,230
Brother.

689
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,630
Lin Gong is dead.

690
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,320
How did you do it?

691
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,710
I didn't.

692
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,000
Whatever,

693
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,520
just handle it cautiously.

694
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,710
Lin Gong is dead.

695
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,520
Really?

696
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,670
It was discovered by the Investigator's Office.

697
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,190
He died in a desolated yard

698
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,230
in the suburb yesterday.

699
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,470
The killer might be a sword master.

700
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,080
How could it happen?!

701
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
Have they found the killer?

702
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,150
Is Wuzhu back?

703
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,430
I haven't seen him for a long time.

704
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,910
Is Uncle Wuzhu involved?

705
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,150
I'm just asking.

706
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,280
You can leave.

707
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,390
Do you know Taiping Residence?

708
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,710
Why do you ask?

709
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,560
I heard that

710
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,080
my mom used to live there.

711
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,080
Yes.

712
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,360
I want to visit her past residence

713
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,600
to mourn for her.

714
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,430
You can't go there.

715
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,230
Why?

716
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:09,950
I told you that

717
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,670
your mom's identity

718
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,600
must remain a secret.

719
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,670
I will keep a distance.

720
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,430
No way.

721
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,670
You'll have to wait

722
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,360
till you inherit the Neiku.

723
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,910
Father.

724
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,190
Say no more.

725
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,080
Then I'll see myself out.

726
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,040
Brother.

727
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,800
Brother. Brother. Brother.

728
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,710
Have you thought of a name?

729
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,710
What name?

730
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,470
A name for our business.

731
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,470
For our bookstore?

732
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,280
Let's call it Danbo Bookstore.

733
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,080
Danbo?

734
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,390
There's an allusion to it.

735
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,630
Only by remaining indifferent to fame
and fortune can one show his high ideals.

736
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,710
Fine. Fine. Fine.

737
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,390
It doesn't matter.

738
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,560
Illusion or not, that's not important.

739
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,710
The most urgent task for you

740
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,360
is to write your book.

741
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,800
When our bookstore opens,

742
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
its future and prospect

743
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
all counts on you.

744
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,280
Don't engage yourself in all the social activities.

745
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,190
Young Master Fan Xian,

746
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,870
the Crown Prince has the door blocked

747
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,120
and orders to see you in the Eastern Palace.

748
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,080
The Crown Prince?

749
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,630
Young Master Fan Xian,

750
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,390
the sedan of the Prime Minister's mansion

751
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,430
has arrived at the door.

752
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,560
The Prime Minister wants to see you.

753
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,430
Lin Ruofu?

754
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,710
Can they just let him write his book?

755
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,390
Get lost!

756
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,840
Just leave us.

757
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,800
Yes.

758
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,760
It must be for Lin Gong's death.

759
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,800
I have nothing to do with that.

760
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,800
Why do they want to see me?

761
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,840
I'm afraid

762
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,190
you'll figure that out after seeing them.

763
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,670
Then who should I see first?

764
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,670
Prime Minister Lin Ruofu

765
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,120
and the Crown Prince are not on the same side.

766
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,390
Whoever you choose to see first,

767
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,870
you'll offend the other one.

768
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,320
Young Master Fan Xian,

769
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,470
the imperial guards are here.

770
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,280
His Majesty ordered to see you
through a verbal instruction.

771
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,280
Now you don't have to choose.

772
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,100
In the river of history,

773
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,300
time goes round and round.

774
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,660
Memories about the former and present lives

775
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,540
join each other in an endless way.

776
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,140
In the long drunken Milky Way,

777
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,860
one season follows another in a flash,

778
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,060
and the wild geese are flying south.

779
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,980
I just can't give up

780
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,980
to be with you for my whole life.

781
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:58,260
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

782
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

783
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,940
Year after year in the wandering,

784
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,500
I count the remaining years.

785
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,700
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

786
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,260
even though we have ended up the destiny,

787
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,940
I never feel regretful.

788
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,900
In such a chaotic world,

789
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,660
I still miss you as ever.

790
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,300
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

791
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,020
With a gentle heart,

792
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,580
I cherish our remaining years.

793
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,420
Even though we have to go through

794
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,380
all the hardships along the journey,

795
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:37,700
you always stay by my side,

796
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,460
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

797
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,380
Year after year in the wandering,

798
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,740
I count the remaining years.

799
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,100
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

800
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,900
even though we end up the destiny,

801
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,340
I never feel regretful.

802
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,260
In such a chaotic world,

803
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,220
I still miss you as ever.

804
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,900
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

805
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,660
With a gentle heart,

806
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,060
I cherish our remaining years.

807
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,860
Even though we have to go through

808
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,020
all the hardships along the journey,

809
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:18,300
you always stay by my side...
