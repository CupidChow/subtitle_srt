1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 12

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
You really don't have to check her up!

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
I told you she's asleep!

18
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,600
Do you want a bite?

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,240
Lady Ye, please rest early.

20
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,550
I'm not sleepy yet.

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,160
I'll go to sleep after eating.

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
Where is he?

23
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,520
This...

24
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,160
It's an act out of emergency.

25
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,390
I see. I see.

26
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,960
It's a common plot in the stories.

27
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,390
I'd better wait outside.

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,320
Ling'er! Ling...

29
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,000
Ling'er is gone.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,390
Why don't you get up?

31
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm tired. I need a few more minutes.

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,630
You can't!

33
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,550
Why not?

34
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,670
I'll be condemned for this.

35
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,000
We're engaged.

36
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,720
But we're not married yet.

37
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,320
Get up!

38
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,320
Get up!

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,270
Just get up!

40
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,880
I'll leave if you don't get up!

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,440
I'm up.

42
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
Why are you still here?

43
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,270
I'll leave when you're asleep.

44
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,720
Just leave.

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,320
It's bad to be seen.

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,110
I'm so lucky.

47
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,550
What?

48
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,390
I fell in love with a girl.

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,720
It turns out that

50
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,670
she is my future wife.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
The God must have blessed me!

52
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,070
Otherwise, how could I be so lucky?

53
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,390
Rumor has it that

54
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,160
Miss Si Lili from Joy Tsin House

55
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,920
loves you dearly.

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,230
I have nothing to do with her.

57
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,350
We are complete strangers.

58
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,040
Really?

59
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,920
Really!

60
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,070
I caused so much trouble

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,550
only to cancel the marriage.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Why do you want to cancel the marriage?

63
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,440
Because I'm in love with

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,550
a maidservant who steals drumsticks.

65
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,720
Even if you succeed,

66
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
Earl Sinan won't allow you

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,040
to marry a maidservant.

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,110
I don't listen to him.

69
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,880
What about the imperial edict from His Majesty?

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,880
Then I'll run away

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,480
with her.

72
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,320
If His Majesty leads troops in person

73
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,350
to catch me,

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,270
I'll take her out of Nanqing

75
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,390
to the end of the world.

76
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,320
And I'll steal lots of chickens on the way

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
so that she can eat lots of drumsticks.

78
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,390
How come His Majesty will try to

79
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,070
catch you in person?

80
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,480
You never know.

81
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,510
Is that really your plan?

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,670
Yes.

83
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,230
So I've been looking for you all the time.

84
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,830
But I'm sick with tuberculosis.

85
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,230
I can't travel with you

86
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,600
to a faraway land.

87
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,950
When you're cured,

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,230
I'll take you out.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,830
I've been sick for years.

90
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,720
Even the imperial physicians couldn't cure me.

91
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,480
That's because they were wrong from the start.

92
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,880
I didn't ask you to eat more meat

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,230
randomly.

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,480
Treated carefully,

95
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,270
tuberculosis can also be cured.

96
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,600
Believe me.

97
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,390
I will cure you.

98
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,160
I believe you.

99
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
Thank you, Doctor Fan.

100
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,640
What did you just call me?

101
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,440
Doctor Fan.

102
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,480
Is that right?

103
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,830
Then what should I call you?

104
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,920
Only after we get married can I call you otherwise.

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,550
I just want you

106
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,600
to call me Fan.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,160
Do I have to wait till the marriage?

108
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,480
Can I visit you

109
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,070
regularly?

110
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,760
No.

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,270
You know what?

112
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,110
Sometimes, a simple answer as "No"

113
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,350
can ruin one's life.

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,550
What do you mean?

115
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,070
Let me tell you a story.

116
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,230
Good!

117
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,600
I love to hear stories the most.

118
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
What a coincidence!

119
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm really good at telling stories!

120
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,390
Then go ahead.

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,000
It was happened

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,640
a long, long time ago.

123
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,440
Once upon a time, there was a young man.

124
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
He went to school every day.

125
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,480
A young girl from his village

126
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,480
followed him

127
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,600
every day.

128
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,350
But girls are not allowed to go to school.

129
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,720
Well, the rules were not so strict

130
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
back then.

131
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,350
Well, go on.

132
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,720
Day by day, she followed him all the time.

133
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,600
Finally, he could tolerate it no more.

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,040
He stopped to ask her.

135
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,160
He said...

136
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,720
"Why do you follow me?"

137
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,110
"I follow you

138
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,760
because I like to see you.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
I won't bother you.

140
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,840
Isn't that OK?"

141
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,910
What did he say?

142
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,030
He said...

143
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
"No!"

144
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,550
After saying that, he turned around and left,

145
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,760
only leaving the young girl

146
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,520
standing there by herself.

147
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,590
Guess what happened later.

148
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,710
She probably

149
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,470
left the village.

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
Why would she leave?

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,520
She was forced

152
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,400
by worldly prejudice.

153
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,320
Though I applaud her for being bold,

154
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,080
I pity her more.

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,280
Why is that?

156
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,640
For ordinary families, if a man and a woman fall in love,

157
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,230
a matchmaker should be sent to propose a marriage first.

158
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,670
Then follow the formalities of three letters and six rites.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,150
Later after exchanging the written
marriage proposals, they can get engaged.

160
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,840
Though she acted

161
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
out of love,

162
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,710
it shall not be tolerated by worldly ethics and rites.

163
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,470
It was happened a long time ago.

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Back then,

165
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,880
the rites were not so strict.

166
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,320
If a man and a woman fell in love,

167
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,470
they could express their feelings face to face.

168
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,840
Which dynasty is that?

169
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,080
Which village can be

170
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,550
so tolerant to women?

171
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,590
How come I don't know?

172
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,790
This is a story.

173
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,710
You can't be so serious about stories.

174
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,710
Well then.

175
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,200
Later after finishing his studies,

176
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,440
he left the village.

177
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,440
But he always

178
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,520
remembered her.

179
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,840
When he returned home

180
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,440
in his seventies,

181
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,320
he wanted to see her again.

182
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,550
Back then,

183
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,440
she was also in her sixties.

184
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,110
She sent a message,

185
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,440
saying, "I know you want to see me,

186
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,590
but,

187
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,710
No!"

188
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,880
So he also sent her a message.

189
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,880
"Tomorrow morning,

190
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,080
I'll wait for you

191
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,200
on the same road to school

192
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,110
with a branch of pink cherry blossoms."

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,790
Guess whether she went to see him or not.

194
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,470
I've no idea.

195
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,590
The next morning,

196
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,960
he grabbed one hundred branches of pink cherry blossoms

197
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,230
and waited for her on that road.

198
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,960
Whenever he saw

199
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,320
an old lady passing by,

200
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,030
he would hand out a branch.

201
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,000
Because he knew

202
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,590
the young girl

203
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,960
followed him

204
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,710
back then

205
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,910
was definitely among them.

206
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,840
Sometimes,

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,840
a simple "No"

208
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,470
would ruin one's whole life.

209
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,280
So never, never

210
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,000
say that word out

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,640
easily!

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,710
Are you moved?

213
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,670
Did he ever get married?

214
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,960
Yes, he did.

215
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,640
But he just couldn't forget her.

216
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,590
If so,

217
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,280
why did he

218
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,590
marry another woman?

219
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,200
Why didn't he try to find her

220
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,150
when they were still young?

221
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,880
Well...

222
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,150
He was married

223
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,230
and lived his life.

224
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,350
But he went back

225
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,470
to find her

226
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,320
at such an old age.

227
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,350
Why is that?

228
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,400
He just didn't want to

229
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
have regrets.

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,960
But had he ever

231
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
thought about her?

232
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,760
What if she was also married?

233
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,840
How would her family

234
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
take this?

235
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Well, there weren't

236
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,320
so many rules and rites

237
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,200
when the story

238
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,910
happened.

239
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,230
And she didn't have

240
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,910
many family members.

241
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,960
Have you gone to school

242
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,590
in Danzhou?

243
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,150
It has nothing to do with me.

244
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,880
I never went to school in Danzhou.

245
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,470
Nor did I know any girl.

246
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,590
Then why did you

247
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,880
tell me the story?

248
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,400
I just want to

249
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,880
criticize the man with you.

250
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,760
Criticize him!

251
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,080
It really has nothing to do with me.

252
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,400
Just give me

253
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,230
another chance.

254
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,150
I'll tell you

255
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,710
another story.

256
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,470
I know a lot of stories.

257
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,030
I...

258
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,230
I'll tell you the story of the prince and the princess.

259
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,710
I'll tell you the story of

260
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,000
the monk and the monkey.

261
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,880
Or the story of the beauty and the beast.

262
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,960
I remember you are the author of the Red Mansions.

263
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,230
Actually it was written by Mr. Cao.

264
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,840
I'm just retelling the story.

265
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,960
Just tell me the unfinished part of

266
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,440
the Red Mansions.

267
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,790
Does it mean

268
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,230
I can visit you

269
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,710
every day?

270
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,320
I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

271
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,110
Luckily, it's you.

272
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,350
I mean,

273
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,470
luckily, you are

274
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,840
my future wife.

275
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,110
In future, besides the Red Mansions,

276
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,910
I'll tell you many other

277
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,710
interesting stories.

278
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,520
Now, just listen to the doctor

279
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,520
and have a good dream.

280
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,840
Luckily, it's you.

281
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,320
How long will they talk?

282
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,470
Be careful not to catch a cold.

283
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,670
I feel warm inside.

284
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
You've caught a cold!

285
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,320
Whose fault is it?

286
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,440
You didn't call me when he's gone.

287
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,710
I fell asleep.

288
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,280
Wanqiu.

289
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,030
My Lady.

290
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,110
Ling'er has caught a cold.

291
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,280
Fetch her some medicine.

292
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Yes.

293
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,080
I'm fine.

294
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,440
After finishing breakfast with you,

295
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,350
I'll go to the Fan mansion.

296
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,400
What for?

297
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,440
To challenge Fan Xian, of course!

298
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,080
Now that you've got someone in your heart,

299
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,440
I certainly have to give him a good beat

300
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,350
so that he can cancel the marriage contract himself.

301
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,670
He is Fan Xian.

302
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,280
Who?

303
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,230
He!

304
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,470
He...

305
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,110
Right!

306
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,760
Why did he pretend to be a doctor?

307
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,760
It's complicated.

308
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,280
He didn't know I am me.

309
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,310
He didn't know you are you?

310
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,800
It's really complicated.

311
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,400
Wait a moment!

312
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,190
What about his improper relationship

313
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,230
with Si Lili?

314
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,640
He said it's not true.

315
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,880
You really believe that?

316
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,640
Where are you going?

317
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,070
To find Si Lili.

318
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,110
Figure out

319
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,110
her relationship with Fan Xian for you.

320
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,830
Hold your hand, and age with you.

321
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,280
How come you're back?

322
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,230
Princess,

323
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,000
Her Highness wants to see you.

324
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,830
Her Highness...

325
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,040
Lady Ling'er.

326
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,230
This is the medicine

327
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,590
My Lady ordered for you just now.

328
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,800
Please drink it before you leave.

329
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,190
Take these medical packages, too.

330
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,310
Take the medicine for another two days.

331
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,070
You'll be cured completely.

332
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,160
All right. See you.

333
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,800
Mother!

334
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,920
Come on!

335
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,920
Take a seat.

336
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,560
Yes.

337
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
Allow me.

338
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,280
I heard you've seen a doctor.

339
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,310
Do you feel better?

340
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,950
His treating method

341
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,640
is somewhat special.

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,920
I must have a try.

343
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,310
It's always good to have a new method.

344
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
I ask you over

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,110
to tell you another piece of good news.

346
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,280
Good news?

347
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,430
Your marriage with Fan Xian

348
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,400
might be cancelled soon.

349
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,470
Isn't it an order from His Majesty?

350
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,950
After all, it's not in the written form.

351
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,470
There's still room for discussion.

352
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,950
Also, Chengze

353
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,190
also heard of it

354
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,680
somehow.

355
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,190
He's trying to cancel the marriage for you.

356
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,760
Plus your unwillingness to marry him,

357
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,590
It's likely to be cancelled.

358
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Actually...

359
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,640
Actually, there's no rush.

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,070
Last time, you said yourself that

361
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,310
the marriage must be canceled, right?

362
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,950
There are misunderstandings after all.

363
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,280
Misunderstandings?

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,230
If there were misunderstandings,

365
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,400
when did you address them?

366
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,710
Is there any misunderstanding

367
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,560
between us?

368
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,710
I don't think so.

369
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,160
Do you believe me now?

370
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,680
I fell in love with a girl.

371
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,760
It turns out that

372
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,400
she is my future wife.

373
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,160
The God must have blessed me!

374
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,590
Otherwise, how could I be so lucky?

375
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,110
You've met Fan Xian?

376
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,400
How did you meet?

377
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,350
Mother, you're thinking too much!

378
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,470
You have feelings for him?

379
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,190
How can that be!

380
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,680
You'd better not.

381
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,470
Do you still want to cancel the marriage?

382
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,230
Just let it be for now.

383
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,000
Judged from your words,

384
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,950
you must like him.

385
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,560
As a mother, I will not

386
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,520
go against your wills.

387
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,000
How would I like him?

388
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,400
You can't be too tired.

389
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,230
We should discuss about it later.

390
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,400
Escort the princess back home.

391
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,680
Yes.

392
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,040
She likes him already.

393
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
How fast!

394
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,680
Take a bite?

395
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,160
No!

396
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,110
Stop pulling a long face all day long.

397
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,800
Smile!

398
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I don't make money by smiling.

399
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,800
I won't pay you even if you smile.

400
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,560
Fan.

401
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,310
Li.

402
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,950
-Li? -How are you?

403
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,230
Li?

404
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,920
It sounds close.

405
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,640
What's up?

406
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,920
The Second Prince would like to see you.

407
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,470
When?

408
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,470
How about tomorrow.

409
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,350
Where?

410
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,310
Well.

411
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,880
Miss Si Lili's

412
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,950
Joy Tsin House, of course.

413
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,160
She's dead.

414
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,560
You threaten to kill me.

415
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,560
Even if I feel reluctant,

416
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,520
I have no other choice.

417
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,230
That monster is untamed.

418
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,110
He only takes order when seeing the token.

419
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,680
Here you are.

420
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,800
How could it be him?

421
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,520
What are you doing?

422
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,760
The fire is going out. I'm helping.

423
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,830
Put it down! You know nothing!

424
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,830
This is the liquid medicine

425
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,920
I specially made for Wan'er.

426
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,680
It should be simmered with slow fire for 16 hours.

427
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,590
It can remove heat from the lung to relieve cough.

428
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,830
You almost ruined it.

429
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,680
Are you going to see her again?

430
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,350
We're engaged. It's fine.

431
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,590
You're not married after all.

432
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,110
It's improper.

433
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,640
You don't understand.

434
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,830
I don't visit her

435
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,000
as a man,

436
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,000
but as a doctor.

437
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,190
Wan'er has been sick with tuberculosis for years,

438
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,680
so her medicine should be prepared cautiously.

439
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,160
I visit her frequently

440
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,350
in order to cure her disease and save her life.

441
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I am benign and openhearted,

442
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,710
and I have nothing to hide.

443
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Really?

444
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,710
Then why do you wear the black tights?

445
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,680
Why do you always visit her at night?

446
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,110
You're much talkative than before.

447
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,400
He who touches rouge will be stained with red.

448
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,560
You really mean the second part of the sentence, right?

449
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,800
I still find certain things

450
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,190
to be weird.

451
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,950
Visiting a lady at night is weird of course!

452
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,920
I mean what you just said.

453
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,680
He who touches rouge will be stained with red,
and he who touches ink will be stained with black.

454
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,760
What's wrong with it?

455
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,640
Where does it come from?

456
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,760
It was from ancient times.

457
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,230
No one knows the exact time.

458
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,070
It was originally said by Fu Xuan,

459
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,070
the Commandant-escort of the Western Jin Dynasty.

460
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,230
The Western Jin Dynasty?

461
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,110
Which dynasty is that?

462
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,590
Some poems in my memory

463
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,470
are also known

464
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,230
in this world.

465
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,040
Sometimes, I really can't tell

466
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,430
whether my memory goes wrong

467
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,520
or this world is not real.

468
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,560
Why am I telling you this?

469
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,680
What are you doing?

470
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,760
Sprinkle the spices of the sachet.

471
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,400
The sachet should be hung at the waist.

472
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
I'm using it differently.

473
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,710
The spices inside the sachet

474
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,470
can be used to make dishes.

475
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,310
I know that.

476
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,950
Normally, the sachet is filled with

477
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,000
angelica root, ligusticum wallichii and rhizoma kaempferiae.

478
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,470
That's an easy one.

479
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,280
So now you smell like

480
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,760
a spiced duck.

481
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,350
You know nothing!

482
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,520
This is no normal sachet.

483
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,110
I made it specially

484
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,760
for Wan'er.

485
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,590
It contains the extracts of

486
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,190
over 80 floral leaves in total.

487
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,310
It smells fresh at first, mellow in the middle,

488
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,230
and lingering at last.

489
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,520
Wan'er must like it.

490
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,560
Such a bumpkin!

491
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,680
Split the goods among yourselves.

492
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,950
Keep your mouth shut, and leave the capital before the dawn.

493
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,680
Why?

494
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,310
I've been caught in big trouble.

495
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,800
If you don't go,

496
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,470
you'll also be involved.

497
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,710
What about you?

498
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,920
The Second Prince

499
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,400
has invited Fan Xian over tomorrow.

500
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,160
I have to stay for another day.

501
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,560
I've sent the servants

502
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,880
to the frontcourt on purpose.

503
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,040
There's no one at the corridor, either.

504
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,560
No need to get in through the window.

505
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm used to that.

506
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,520
Are you feeling better?

507
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,350
Much better.

508
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,880
You've eaten spiced duck.

509
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,230
It was eaten

510
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,190
by my guard.

511
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,760
Shall I tell you another story tonight?

512
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,160
You can tell me in the day.

513
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,520
Your residence is managed under strict rules in the day.

514
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,590
I won't be able to get in.

515
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,560
You can write it down

516
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,710
and have it delivered.

517
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,560
I left the window open

518
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,590
and sent the servants away

519
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,040
because I have something to tell you.

520
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm listening.

521
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,520
Though surprised,

522
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,350
I feel really happy

523
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,680
to know that you are Fan Xian.

524
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
I shouldn't tell you this,

525
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,640
but I want you

526
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,830
to know

527
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,280
how I feel.

528
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,760
So do I.

529
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm also happy to see you.

530
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,920
However,

531
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,280
if you love a girl,

532
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,230
you should respect her first.

533
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,920
You sneak into my room through the window every night.

534
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,950
Are you dallying with me?

535
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,710
We have a long future

536
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,880
ahead.

537
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,230
If you want to tell me stories,

538
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,760
why not wait till we get married?

539
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,280
Actually, I visit you specially at night

540
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,190
not only to tell you stories.

541
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,680
Medicine!

542
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,400
You're back.

543
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,470
It's worn out again.

544
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,070
It's also worn out for climbing tress.

545
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,230
I'll heat the food for you.

546
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,920
Today, I went to see my friend

547
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,040
in the box again.

548
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,920
I also delivered him some food.

549
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,950
Who would live

550
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,190
in a box?

551
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,430
There really is. I've seen one with my own eyes.

552
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,160
He plays with the wooden horse you made

553
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,350
right when he gets back.

554
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,470
And he refuses to get off.

555
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,640
I'm glad he likes it.

556
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,040
Run!

557
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,710
It's so late.

558
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,880
Get off it now.

559
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,110
Wash up and go to bed.

560
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,430
If you don't get off,

561
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,760
I'll throw it away.

562
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,680
You can't!

563
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,880
Mom, dad made it for me!

564
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
Zijing!

565
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,880
Call me again!

566
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,520
Call him again!

567
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,710
Call him again!

568
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,350
Fine!

569
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,950
We've got a long future,

570
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,430
I can wait!

571
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,160
I designed the prescription myself

572
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,710
to relieve the cough.

573
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,880
You know

574
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
I learned toxicology with my teacher.

575
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
So I'm bold in using medicine.

576
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,400
Some of the medical ingredients

577
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,760
won't be used normally.

578
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
If I don't deliver it secretly,

579
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,350
I'm afraid you won't be able to see it.

580
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,830
Why do you drink first?

581
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,950
I'm trying it

582
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,190
to prove it's OK.

583
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,040
No need to try it. I believe you.

584
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,040
It doesn't taste bitter, right?

585
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,280
I made the crystal sugar myself.

586
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,040
And I also added osmanthus fragrans.

587
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,470
This is the sweetest medicine

588
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,280
I've ever had in my entire life.

589
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,430
I'm glad you like it.

590
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,760
It must be time consuming.

591
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,880
The medical ingredients are easy to find.

592
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,950
But I have to watch it

593
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,760
during the decoction.

594
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,160
I must stay focused for hours.

595
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,040
Why didn't you send a maidservant to do that?

596
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,920
It's for you.

597
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
I don't trust others.

598
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,470
Then thank you, Doctor Fan!

599
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,800
What's wrong?

600
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,520
I just feel sleepy?

601
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,630
Sleepy? You feel sleepy suddenly?

602
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,760
It's fine. One of the ingredients

603
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,870
might not suit you.

604
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,840
Just like being drunk,

605
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,760
you'll be fine after a good sleep.

606
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,390
I'll change that ingredient later.

607
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,150
Wan'er.

608
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,150
Wan'er.

609
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,430
Wan'er.

610
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,630
I feel so hot!

611
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,560
So hot!

612
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,870
Wan'er.

613
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,360
-I want to go for a blow! -Stop! You might catch a cold!

614
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,560
Stop! Stop!

615
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,320
At last,

616
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,670
the emperor gave up the throne

617
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,120
and never went back.

618
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,120
Because he only wanted to

619
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,600
travel around the world

620
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,470
with the woman he loved.

621
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,950
Wan'er.

622
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,360
Are you listening?

623
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,280
Travel around the world...

624
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,710
I have a secret

625
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,870
to tell you.

626
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,280
Actually,

627
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
I'm from another world.

628
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,000
I was about to die,

629
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,390
but when I woke up,

630
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,870
I was here

631
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,190
somehow.

632
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,560
This world

633
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,470
is very different from

634
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,430
the one I remember.

635
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,040
But they are also closely linked

636
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,080
in so many ways.

637
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,000
I've never told my secret

638
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,230
to anyone else.

639
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,910
It's useless even if I tell them.

640
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,470
Who would believe me?

641
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,800
You may find me

642
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,760
laughing and joking all the time,

643
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
but I feel especially lonely at heart.

644
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,840
I often wonder

645
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,150
if I'm redundant in this world.

646
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,080
I walk in this world

647
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,000
alone.

648
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,190
I have nothing to tell others.

649
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,840
And I don't care

650
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,080
what others say.

651
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,560
No one around me

652
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,910
can truly

653
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,910
understand me.

654
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,800
Until I met you.

655
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,360
After meeting you,

656
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,670
I found it's meaningful

657
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,430
to stay

658
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,520
in this world.

659
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,840
I stopped wondering

660
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,320
what this world is all about

661
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,390
and who I really am.

662
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,760
Who are you?

663
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,230
Brother.

664
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,560
How about I go with you?

665
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,360
He invited me to a brothel boat.

666
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,470
It's improper for you to go.

667
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,040
I suppose the Second Prince wants to draw you over to his side.

668
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,840
I know.

669
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,390
What's your plan?

670
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,390
Getting involved in their competition for the throne

671
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,430
might bring trouble to the family.

672
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,080
I'd better keep a distance.

673
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,950
Ruoruo,

674
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,800
what if I decide to go back to Danzhou?

675
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,190
Then I'll go with you.

676
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,000
Let me think about it.

677
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,040
Well, just go inside.

678
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,630
Brother, be careful!

679
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,630
Since the trial last time,

680
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,520
the Crown Prince hasn't made a move.

681
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,520
I'm really worried.

682
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,080
This is the capital city.

683
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,910
Can he really kill me on the streets?

684
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,000
Go inside.

685
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,710
To the Joy Tsin House!

686
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,860
=Cheng Jushu, Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master of Beiqi=

687
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,280
I rarely see you smile.

688
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,430
Are you in a good mood today?

689
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,150
My son called me last night.

690
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,710
They must be really important to you.

691
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,430
If there's no one

692
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,390
you're willing to die for

693
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,840
in this world,

694
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,520
how boring it will be!

695
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,870
I understand.

696
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,800
Only with someone like that

697
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,630
can we really

698
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,800
take roots in this world.

699
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,390
I just heard that

700
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,630
you want to go back to Danzhou?

701
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,280
Not until I marry Wan'er.

702
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,230
Will you

703
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,280
go with me?

704
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,470
We could be neighbors.

705
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,520
You are really leaving the capital city?

706
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,800
Before I came here,

707
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,600
I wanted to find out the one who tried to kill me,

708
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,800
to explore the past of my mom,

709
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,840
and to figure out

710
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,710
the secrets of this world.

711
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,230
What now?

712
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,190
I realize that

713
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,190
I'm a lazy man after all.

714
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,950
I just want to live.

715
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,320
As long as my payment

716
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,120
doesn't change,

717
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,150
I can follow you anywhere.

718
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,520
Then you'd better do a good job!

719
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,430
I'm afraid I can't.

720
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,560
I owe this life

721
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,840
to my family.

722
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,080
As to you,

723
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,150
when there's some danger,

724
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,910
you should face it yourself.

725
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,230
I'll run away immediately.

726
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,080
You're really honest.

727
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,390
Fan Xian should be here soon.

728
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,710
Take it easy. I'm early.

729
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,660
In the river of history,

730
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,860
time goes round and round.

731
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,220
Memories about the former and present lives

732
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,100
join each other in an endless way.

733
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,700
In the long drunken Milky Way,

734
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,420
one season follows another in a flash,

735
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,620
and the wild geese are flying south.

736
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,540
I just can't give up

737
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,540
to be with you for my whole life.

738
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,820
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

739
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

740
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,500
Year after year in the wandering,

741
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,060
I count the remaining years.

742
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,260
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

743
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,820
even though we have ended up the destiny,

744
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,500
I never feel regretful.

745
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,460
In such a chaotic world,

746
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,220
I still miss you as ever.

747
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,860
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

748
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,580
With a gentle heart,

749
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,140
I cherish our remaining years.

750
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,980
Even though we have to go through

751
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,940
all the hardships along the journey,

752
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:52,260
you always stay by my side,

753
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,020
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

754
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,940
Year after year in the wandering,

755
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,300
I count the remaining years.

756
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,660
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

757
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,460
even though we end up the destiny,

758
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,900
I never feel regretful.

759
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,820
In such a chaotic world,

760
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,780
I still miss you as ever.

761
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,460
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

762
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,220
With a gentle heart,

763
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,620
I cherish our remaining years.

764
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,420
Even though we have to go through

765
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,580
all the hardships along the journey,

766
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:32,860
you always stay by my side...
