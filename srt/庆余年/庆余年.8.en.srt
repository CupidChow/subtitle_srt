1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 8

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,230
The Crown Prince will know about

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,080
us meeting each other sooner or later.

18
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,310
Aren't you worried about that?

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Your Highness, do you know any girl

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,760
who likes to eat drumsticks?

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,480
Do you believe love at first sight?

22
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,270
I didn't either,

23
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,830
but I do now.

24
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,190
I met a girl

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,720
who had a drumstick in her hand.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,400
I want to share the story

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,510
with you.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,390
Are you interested?

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,470
Yeah.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,520
Go ahead. I'm all ears.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,600
This poem is amazing!

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,080
Judging from it,

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,800
I think Fan Xian is of much talent.

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,390
Auntie,

35
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,960
it's not bad if Wan'er marries him.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
He deserves her.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Besides the poem,

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,080
His Majesty also sent me word that

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,830
Chengze is in urgent need of talents

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,390
and he's meeting Fan Xian

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,000
in Prince Jing's mansion.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,190
It'll be late even if you hurry there.

43
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,750
Chengze is scheming.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,390
He's been thinking about

45
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,960
taking over Neiku.

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,470
Luckily, we got the word in time.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
We still have time to make preparations.

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,110
It seems

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,830
His Majesty

50
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,240
cares about you more.

51
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,190
Auntie,

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,000
why do you hate Fan Xian so much?

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,160
Of course it's for the throne.

54
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,390
Drink some tea.

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,520
I've told you the whole story

56
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,910
of me and the drumstick girl.

57
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,670
Did you get it?

58
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,720
Yes. Got it.

59
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,520
No, you didn't.

60
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,520
I want to marry her.

61
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,800
But my father and your father

62
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,800
want you to marry Wan'er.

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,320
I don't agree.

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,800
Now that I want to break off my marriage contract,

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,000
I won't take over Neiku.

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,000
The marriage contract is approved by my father.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,550
How will you break it off?

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
Just wait and see.

69
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,360
What if you can't

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
see the drumstick girl anymore?

71
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,320
I've been lucky.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,110
Fan Xian,

73
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,390
I'm eager to see

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,950
what you're going to do next.

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,320
Let's kill that chicken

76
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
and cut it up later.

77
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,760
Do you want it?

78
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
No.

79
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,830
Let's eat what we like.

80
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,320
Did you steal it?

81
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you hungry?

82
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,640
Not really.

83
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Do you live here?

84
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,070
You're not allowed to eat drumsticks?

85
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,070
Are you a maidservant?

86
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
Help yourself. Eat.

87
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,950
You...

88
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,880
I can't do it with you staring at me.

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,320
It's okay.

90
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,110
I like to watch others eat drumsticks.

91
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,000
How about you?

92
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
Why are you here?

93
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm...

94
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,070
I'm a servant.

95
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm here with my Young Master

96
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,790
for the poetry gathering.

97
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,790
Look. You're a maidservant.

98
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,510
I'm a servant.

99
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,510
What a perfect match!

100
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,550
I don't think so.

101
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,830
You don't live here.

102
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,200
How about

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,320
me transferring here?

104
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,110
It's not as simple as you think.

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Who...

106
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,070
Who is your Young Master?

107
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,390
Um. I'm...

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,390
Persimmon?

109
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,830
You really came here.

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,830
Aren't you afraid to lose face?

111
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,720
A master of words.

112
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,350
I have no other feat left.

113
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
I will kill you.

114
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,790
How dare you!

115
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,230
"At the tower, I stand in the mist."

116
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,390
Guo Baokun.

117
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,320
He's my Young Master.

118
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,230
We're here for the poetry gathering.

119
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I've heard he's competing

120
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,000
with Fan Xian in poetry.

121
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,320
He lost badly.

122
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,670
He can't do it at all.

123
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,880
He's stupid.

124
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,350
Isn't he your Master?

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,270
But I'm righteous.

126
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,950
I don't tell lies.

127
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,000
You coughed up blood that day.

128
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,640
What happened?

129
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,320
He hit me.

130
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,670
He often did that.

131
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,760
But you look happy

132
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,510
when you said that.

133
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,950
It's because I saw you.

134
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Help yourself.

135
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,200
You can eat the drumstick while talking to me.

136
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,760
Is Fan Xian

137
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,320
also there?

138
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,670
Can you show me which one is him?

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
Why do you want to see him?

140
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,110
Nothing. I'm just curious.

141
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,710
Forget about it if you don't want to.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,910
What are you doing?

143
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,590
Go. I'll show you who is Fan Xian.

144
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
That one.

145
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,230
He looks a little serious.

146
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,000
I think he's just so so.

147
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,230
Are you married?

148
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,440
Why are you asking this?

149
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,590
I'm just curious.

150
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,030
No.

151
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,400
What a coincidence! Neither am I.

152
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,150
I didn't ask you.

153
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,790
Between a serious man like him and a handsome man like me,

154
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,550
which one do you like better?

155
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,230
Your Master is gone.

156
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,590
Go look for him.

157
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,230
No hurry. You haven't answered me yet.

158
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,470
I'm leaving.

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
What's your name?

160
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
Fan, what are you looking at?

161
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,400
Youth.

162
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,910
Youth?

163
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,230
My Lady.

164
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,280
You scared me.

165
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,230
Why are you eating a drumstick again?

166
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,440
The doctor said

167
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,230
you have to go vegetarian.

168
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,200
Let's go to the poetry gathering.

169
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,590
I'm not going.

170
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,840
You said you'd tell Fan Xian

171
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,320
you don't want to marry him.

172
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,880
After that servant has left.

173
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,470
Servant? Which one?

174
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,470
Nothing.

175
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,320
The poetry gathering has finished.

176
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,400
How about

177
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,550
us going to the Fan mansion

178
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,440
directly?

179
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,590
Let's go.

180
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,400
What are you doing?

181
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Your Excellency.

182
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,280
My daughter

183
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,000
is picky about food.

184
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,960
I want to let her know

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,640
how the dessert served here tastes.

186
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,590
No problem,

187
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,230
but do you have to come here by climbing the wall?

188
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,760
Your Excellency,

189
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,640
it's troublesome to come in from the front door.

190
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,670
I don't want to be questioned.

191
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,440
That's why I did it.

192
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,000
There are some jars

193
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,710
near the wall.

194
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,840
They made me fall down.

195
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,640
Can you have them

196
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
moved to somewhere else?

197
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,520
Cut the crap.

198
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,440
How is that thing going?

199
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,320
Here is the file

200
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,710
you need.

201
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,470
File D No. 534.

202
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,280
It's all

203
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,590
about Teng Zijing.

204
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,110
Your Excellency,

205
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,840
Teng Zijing was killed

206
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,670
in Danzhou.

207
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,520
Why do you need it?

208
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,840
Are you curious?

209
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,670
No. No. No.

210
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,200
I shouldn't have said that.

211
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,000
Take your time.

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,640
I'm leaving.

213
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,710
I'll take this to my daughter.

214
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,400
Hold on.

215
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,670
Don't cross the wall.

216
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,400
Go to the front door.

217
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,000
Is it...

218
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,350
Just go straight ahead.

219
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,280
Tell the gatekeeper

220
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,350
I gave the dessert to you.

221
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Thank you, Your Excellency.

222
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,790
Wang Qinian once saw me,

223
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,030
so I have to avoid him.

224
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,640
It says something

225
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,080
about my wife and son, right?

226
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,520
Calm down.

227
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,710
Give it to me.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,230
Everything was okay.

229
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,400
Why are they fighting?

230
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,670
I'll help you no matter what.

231
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,520
Calm down.

232
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,350
We need to be more thoughtful

233
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,440
at this moment.

234
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,760
Thoughtful?

235
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,550
You want me

236
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,440
to be patient, right?

237
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,200
I just want to say

238
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,840
I can give you a hand

239
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,670
no matter what you want to do.

240
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,470
Don't bother!

241
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,520
We're bound to each other by no ties.

242
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,640
You don't have to do anything for me!

243
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,910
Hold on.

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,110
Stay out of

245
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,710
my business.

246
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,400
What's the matter?

247
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,080
His wife and son were killed.

248
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,760
Who did it?

249
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,760
Guo Baokun is ruthless.

250
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,030
My Lady, are you okay?

251
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,110
I'm good.

252
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,230
Fan Xian.

253
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,230
Are you sure?

254
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,710
I saw him in Prince Jing's mansion.

255
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,640
I couldn't be wrong.

256
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,080
Mr. Fan.

257
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,150
I'm here

258
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,840
to talk about our marriage contract.

259
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,030
Why is he so rude?

260
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,030
Judging from his poems,

261
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,910
he couldn't be like this.

262
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,280
He must've become arrogant after rising to fame.

263
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,030
My Lady,

264
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,280
you'd better not marry him.

265
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,280
I'm afraid

266
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,550
Teng Zijing wants to kill Guo Baokun.

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,640
I know.

268
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,440
He fell out with you

269
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
on purpose.

270
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,280
I know.

271
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,030
He doesn't want to get me involved.

272
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,590
I didn't expect

273
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,230
Guo Baokun is so cruel.

274
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,830
Where do you think

275
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,000
I can find Guo Baokun tonight?

276
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,950
Brother!

277
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,040
Help me find it out.

278
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,160
He...

279
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,400
He may be found by the Liujing River.

280
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,000
Why?

281
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,920
Guo Baokun is a playboy.

282
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,350
He visits the brothels all the year round.

283
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
You can find that line of business a lot

284
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,310
along the Liujing River.

285
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,760
How did you know that?

286
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,430
I checked his background

287
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,110
after you fell out with him.

288
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,430
Brother, he works for the Crown Prince after all.

289
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,680
No matter what you do,

290
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,800
you have to keep yourself safe.

291
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
I see.

292
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,830
Ruoruo,

293
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,070
get someone

294
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,400
to send word to Li Hongcheng.

295
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,520
Your Highness, it's cleared up.

296
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,880
The atmosphere here is good.

297
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
It's like real life.

298
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,470
I'd love to

299
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,800
share happiness with common people,

300
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
but I don't like to stay with them.

301
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,950
What are you going to do tonight?

302
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,430
Fanxian invited me

303
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,950
to go to the Liujing River.

304
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
He's heard that

305
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
there are many beautiful girls there.

306
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,000
He wants to drink and chat with me.

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,680
Where are you going to meet?

308
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,520
He said he's a newcomer,

309
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
so it's up to me.

310
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,470
Your Highness,

311
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,640
you said

312
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,520
you fell in love with a girl at first sight.

313
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,800
Why did he

314
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
want to visit brothels?

315
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,000
Interesting.

316
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,520
So,

317
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,430
shall I go or not tonight?

318
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,190
Of course you should do it.

319
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,830
Where should I...

320
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,470
All right.

321
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,110
Ling'er, help me.

322
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,920
Don't worry.

323
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,070
I'll go to the Fan family

324
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,230
and force him to say sorry to you.

325
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,040
No.

326
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,400
If he doesn't do it,

327
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,070
I'll punch him till he changes his mind.

328
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,040
I mean...

329
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,110
I mean,

330
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,800
can you

331
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,190
go to

332
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,400
Guo Baokun's servant?

333
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,800
No problem. I'm going...

334
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,880
What?

335
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,920
Guo Baokun's servant?

336
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,760
I've heard he spit up blood

337
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
after being hit by Guo Baokun

338
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,880
at the poetry gathering.

339
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,350
Can you go there

340
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
and confirm he's all right?

341
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,110
OK?

342
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,280
How did you

343
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,070
know Guo Baokun's servant?

344
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,000
You don't have to know about that.

345
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,190
Just tell me

346
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,560
if you'll do it or not.

347
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,110
Sir, I haven't seen you for a long time.

348
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,000
This way, please.

349
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,160
This way, please.

350
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,430
On the third floor as usual.

351
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,800
This is one of the most well-known brothels

352
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,070
in the capital city.

353
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,800
They have several pleasure boats on the river.

354
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,950
It's said the most popular courtesan here

355
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,640
is kind of related to the royal bloodline.

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,040
The Guo family has lots of rules to follow,

357
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,920
so Guo Baokun always goes home before midnight.

358
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,880
Where are you going?

359
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,310
I'm going inside with you.

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,830
Go back.

361
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Let me go with you.

362
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,680
Father will teach me a good lesson

363
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,590
if he knows

364
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,710
I take you here.

365
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,070
I won't tell him.

366
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,280
Ruoruo.

367
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,190
I'll be distracted

368
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,680
if you go inside with me.

369
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,520
I promise

370
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
I won't act rashly.

371
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,710
Go back.

372
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,800
But...

373
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,430
Brother!

374
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,470
This way, please.

375
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,900
=Joy Tsin House=

376
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,110
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Li.

377
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,430
I just arrived.

378
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,680
Your poems

379
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,190
are being delivered.

380
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,190
Who's there on the pleasure boat?

381
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,680
A new courtesan

382
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,710
called Si Lili.

383
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,070
She's a little famous,

384
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,590
but she seldom shows up.

385
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,160
Many men spent lots of money,

386
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,280
but they still failed to see her.

387
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,070
So, what's the point of

388
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,880
sending my poems there?

389
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,920
She is different

390
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
from others.

391
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,110
Let's go inside and keep waiting there. Go.

392
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,070
This way.

393
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,350
This way.

394
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,800
Wen Ruohan: melodies lingering.

395
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,070
She's good at chimes and archaic music.

396
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,160
The Board of Rites

397
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,800
even asked her for advice on sacrificial culture.

398
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,950
Du Erniang: get you tipsy.

399
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,430
Steaming liquor.

400
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,470
She's expert at steaming liquor.

401
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,000
You must have a taste next time.

402
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,830
Sex is never the best way to please a man.

403
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,110
This is the most popular place

404
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,190
among blue bloods,

405
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,190
because

406
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,070
they can always find

407
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,280
a bosom friend here

408
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
no matter what hobbies they have

409
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,110
or what they're obsessive about.

410
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,920
Meng Xiaoyun: autumnal ripples.

411
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,430
Miss Si Lili's boat is coming over!

412
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,590
Come and check it out!

413
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,830
Follow me!

414
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,470
Who is it for?

415
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,800
Who is the lucky guy?

416
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,560
Hurry up.

417
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,830
Si Lili!

418
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,880
Si Lili!

419
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,640
Si Lili!

420
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,590
Si Lili, look at me!

421
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,560
Si Lili!

422
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,400
Look at me!

423
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,280
Here!

424
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,760
Miss Lili, here!

425
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,230
Miss Lili! Miss Lili!

426
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,640
Si Lili, look at me!

427
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,230
She's coming over toward me.

428
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,190
Here!

429
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,430
Yeah. She's coming over.

430
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,160
I'm nervous.

431
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,280
Pleasure boat is drawing near.

432
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,520
Gorgeous fireworks light up the night sky

433
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
each time when Miss Si Lili comes over.

434
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,070
Her boat has never moved before.

435
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,000
She's coming over for you.

436
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,920
And she's never invited a man back.

437
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,520
She's still a virgin.

438
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,760
Miss Lili.

439
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,590
Fan, are you nervous?

440
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,470
I'm trying to adapt to it.

441
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,950
Beautiful!

442
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,830
You've never been in a brothel?

443
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,400
Yes, never in this life and my past life.

444
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,800
It's different from

445
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,000
what's shown on TV.

446
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,280
Sorry?

447
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,590
Nothing.

448
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,230
She's coming over.

449
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
There she is.

450
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,710
There she is.

451
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,430
Is she a fairy from Heaven? Gorgeous!

452
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,110
So beautiful.

453
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,830
Miss Lili.

454
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,000
Miss Lili.

455
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,680
Let's go.

456
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,430
Hurry up. Follow me.

457
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,520
Miss Lili.

458
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,640
Amazing.

459
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,160
Miss Lili.

460
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,190
Miss Lili.

461
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,470
It's His Highness.

462
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,230
That explains why.

463
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,680
Si Lili: ink plum blossom.

464
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,180
Miss Lili,

465
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,230
=Si Lili, courtesan of Joy Tsin House=
Miss Lili,

466
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,560
=Si Lili, courtesan of Joy Tsin House=
you're really elegant and beautiful.

467
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:52,780
=Si Lili, courtesan of Joy Tsin House=

468
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,560
He's Mr. Fan.

469
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,400
Who is that guy?

470
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,040
Mr. Fan.

471
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,830
I've been thinking

472
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,430
what kind of person

473
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,040
can write such a poem.

474
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,950
I like your poem.

475
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,640
And

476
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,590
you're also not bad.

477
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,190
How about a boat trip on the lake?

478
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,950
A gifted scholar and a lovely lady. Perfect!

479
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,590
Fan, it seems

480
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,470
you'll stay overnight on the boat.

481
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,640
His Highness,

482
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,520
I'm not that kind of person.

483
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,160
Let me drink a toast to you, Miss Lili.

484
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,590
Mr. Fan,

485
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,470
I'll be yours tonight.

486
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,040
Please be gentle with me.

487
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,400
He drugged me, but didn't sleep with me.

488
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,830
Shall I follow him?

489
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,040
No.

490
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,880
We can't risk our identities.

491
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,040
You can leave.

492
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Stay alert.

493
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,310
Fan Xian,

494
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,070
what on earth do you want to do?

495
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,400
Why are you here?

496
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,590
I'm here for a walk after a party with girls.

497
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,430
Why did he kill your wife and son?

498
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,710
It was just something trivial.

499
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,920
He didn't need to do that.

500
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,230
Some guys are cruel by nature.

501
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,560
They're beasts in human clothing.

502
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,470
They're unreasonable.

503
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,190
The file says

504
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,710
he ordered his men to burst into
your house and kill your family.

505
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,680
It's something an arrogant man would do.

506
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,710
He's not that kind of person.

507
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,830
You don't understand his true nature.

508
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,830
He asked the magistrate to punish you

509
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,160
according to the law.

510
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,230
Do you think he'd ignore the law

511
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,430
when it came to your family?

512
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,830
What on earth do you want to say?

513
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,000
We have to take our time.

514
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,590
Guo Baokun

515
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,640
is not that kind of person.

516
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,880
Don't you want to find out the truth?

517
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,350
Are we already there?

518
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,160
Where the hell is it?

519
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,400
Who is it?

520
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,190
Who is it?

521
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,190
Do you know who I am?

522
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,120
We're familiar with each other.

523
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,360
Of course I do.

524
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,040
You are... Fan Xian?

525
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,840
Exactly.

526
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,840
What do you want to do?

527
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,910
I have a question for you.

528
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,870
How dare you

529
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,470
do this to me?

530
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,360
You bastard.

531
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,600
Hit me to death if you dare!

532
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,120
Okay. I'll do as you say.

533
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,470
I won't leave it at that.

534
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,470
I'll report it to His Majesty.

535
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,710
Do you know why I recited

536
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,000
that poem in the daytime?

537
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,670
"A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight."

538
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,000
"Ill now and then for years, alone I'm on this height."

539
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,320
I'm telling you.

540
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,470
I want you to be grieved.

541
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,150
I'll hit you hard

542
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,600
so that you get sick

543
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,560
and become a joke.

544
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,520
Stop it!

545
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,320
Stop it!

546
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,120
Please stop it.

547
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,040
What's your question?

548
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,230
Why did you kill

549
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,390
Teng Zijing's wife and son?

550
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,430
What?

551
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,710
Don't play the fool.

552
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,950
I really have no idea.

553
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,320
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

554
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,630
I remember.

555
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,630
What do you remember?

556
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,470
I remember Teng Zijing,

557
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,630
but his family has nothing to do with me.

558
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,630
You killed them.

559
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,080
How dare you say that?

560
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,560
I didn't!

561
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,520
-I don't know them. -Fine.

562
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,630
You won't tell the truth?

563
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,520
I'll hit you to death.

564
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,470
I didn't do it

565
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,150
even if you killed me.

566
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,800
I really didn't kill them.

567
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,950
I don't think he's lying.

568
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,710
But the file says so.

569
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,630
It couldn't be wrong.

570
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,230
It also says

571
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,320
you're dead.

572
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Do you mean

573
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,910
the file maybe false?

574
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,630
I don't know. We need to find it out.

575
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,470
You can kill him

576
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,360
after finding the truth out.

577
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,470
If it's really him,

578
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,630
I won't stop you.

579
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,910
What should we do now?

580
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,910
Do you know where Wang Qinian lives?

581
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,320
Let me ask Wang Qinian about it

582
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
when we see him.

583
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,150
If something really goes wrong

584
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,870
with the file,

585
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,470
he must know something about it.

586
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,800
Wang Qinian is good at lightness skill.

587
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,760
It's not easy to catch him.

588
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,910
We can do it

589
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,150
if he's unprepared.

590
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,520
Do what?

591
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,710
Wang Qinian!

592
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,710
Wang Qinian!

593
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,840
Your Excellency, your hearing is excellent.

594
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,390
I've followed you all the way indeed.

595
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,470
You're alive!

596
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,600
Was my family

597
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,560
killed by Guo Baokun?

598
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,360
Your wife and son are safe.

599
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,520
They live outside the city.

600
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,360
I'll take you to them if you don't believe.

601
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,600
How about the file?

602
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,190
I was afraid he'd kill them

603
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,080
after killing you,

604
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,840
so...

605
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,840
So you changed

606
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,230
the file?

607
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,630
The file was just there.

608
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,870
I took it to you the next day

609
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,080
just to make a false one.

610
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,080
Where are they?

611
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,670
Right here.

612
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,710
Don't you want to go inside?

613
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,710
Who is it? It's too late.

614
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,670
If you have something, please come here tomorrow morning.

615
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,120
It's me.

616
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,840
They said you're dead.

617
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,120
I'm back.

618
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,430
I thought you're dead.

619
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,230
I thought you're dead.

620
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,360
I thought you're dead.

621
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,800
I thought you're dead.

622
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,670
I thought I'd never see you again.

623
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,950
I thought I'd never see you again.

624
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,040
Where is our son?

625
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,760
He's asleep.

626
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,430
Come in.

627
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,080
He's taller and stronger.

628
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,800
You're finally back.

629
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,470
I'm back.

630
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,760
I'm back.

631
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,600
Everything will be alright.

632
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,910
He'll stay here tonight, right?

633
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,840
Wang Qinian.

634
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,950
Your Excellency, here I am.

635
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,360
You come and go like a shadow.

636
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,120
Why did you tail after me?

637
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,560
I just want to see

638
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,800
what you're going to do next.

639
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,630
I'm sorry.

640
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm narrow-minded.

641
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,600
I got you wrong.

642
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,710
Please forgive me.

643
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,950
You have a good relationship with Teng Zijing?

644
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,230
Actually, just an acquaintance.

645
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,280
So, why did you protect his family?

646
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,390
Teng Zijing once worked for the Investigator's Office.

647
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,600
I knew something about his background.

648
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,950
I think

649
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,430
what he did

650
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,360
is a little admirable.

651
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,120
When I heard of his death,

652
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,600
I thought

653
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:22,870
I should look after

654
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,670
his wife and son.

655
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,670
How did they

656
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,710
move here?

657
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,670
I was afraid

658
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,430
someone else wants to kill them,

659
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,120
so I bought the house.

660
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,520
What if

661
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,760
I really wanted to kill them?

662
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,150
What would you do?

663
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,580
In the river of history,

664
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,780
time goes round and round.

665
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,140
Memories about the former and present lives

666
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,020
join each other in an endless way.

667
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,620
In the long drunken Milky Way,

668
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,340
one season follows another in a flash,

669
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,540
and the wild geese are flying south.

670
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,460
I just can't give up

671
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,460
to be with you for my whole life.

672
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:52,740
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

673
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

674
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,420
Year after year in the wandering,

675
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,980
I count the remaining years.

676
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,180
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

677
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,740
even though we have ended up the destiny,

678
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,420
I never feel regretful.

679
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,380
In such a chaotic world,

680
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,140
I still miss you as ever.

681
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,780
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

682
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,500
With a gentle heart,

683
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,060
I cherish our remaining years.

684
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,900
Even though we have to go through

685
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,860
all the hardships along the journey,

686
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:32,180
you always stay by my side,

687
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,940
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

688
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,860
Year after year in the wandering,

689
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,220
I count the remaining years.

690
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,580
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

691
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,380
even though we end up the destiny,

692
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,820
I never feel regretful.

693
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,740
In such a chaotic world,

694
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,700
I still miss you as ever.

695
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,380
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

696
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,140
With a gentle heart,

697
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,540
I cherish our remaining years.

698
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,340
Even though we have to go through

699
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,500
all the hardships along the journey,

700
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:12,780
you always stay by my side...
