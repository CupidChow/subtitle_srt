1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 42

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,830
Her kid's father

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,830
is Emperor Qing?

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,440
That's right.

19
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,830
I think he's at your age.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,630
I'd been imprisoned for so long,

21
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,270
so I don't know too much about the royal family of Nanqing.

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,550
I'm not sure

23
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,080
which prince is that kid

24
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,080
or if there is something special about him.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,310
The capital city is not a good place.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
The late emperor died there.

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
Your mom died there.

28
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,880
You can live longer if you stay in Danzhou.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,320
My mom was killed in the capital city.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,440
Are those killers still alive?

31
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,750
I have no idea.

32
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,390
We've received an imperial decree to
summon you into the imperial palace.

33
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,670
I see.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,800
This is the truth hidden

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,750
by Chen Pingping and Fan Jian.

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,440
This is why they kept me away from

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
the capital city for so many years.

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,270
I don't belong to the Fan family.

39
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm the son of Emperor Qing.

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm a prince.

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,750
His blood is running

42
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,630
in my veins.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,880
I'm a bit tired and need a rest.

44
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,600
Finish it by yourselves.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,670
You don't have to kneel down if you don't feel like it.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,190
This is different from the palace.

47
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,270
We're in the monarch-subject relationship in palace,

48
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,750
but here...

49
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,750
What's the difference?

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
Come back alive.

51
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,550
Knowing so many things all at once

52
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,630
and knowing your true identity all of a sudden,

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,550
it can be hard to accept.

54
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,670
It's fine

55
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,190
as long as you know

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,110
you're a descendent of the Xiao family.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,550
I feel so relaxed

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,440
after telling the secret

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,470
kept for so long.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,270
But next, the burden

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
is on you.

62
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
You'd better stop talking.

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,160
I'm dying. What's the difference?

64
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,720
It's so dim in the cave.

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,360
Having been locked up for so many years,

66
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,200
I don't like it here.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,270
The scenery is so good here.

68
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,230
Don't let Ku He know

69
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,670
I told you everything.

70
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,760
I see.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,390
Otherwise, he'll kill me instead.

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,510
What's your plan for the future?

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,670
Staying in Beiqi

74
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,200
or going back to Nanqing?

75
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,640
Going back to Nanqing.

76
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,110
Right.

77
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,920
Your roots are there.

78
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,070
Chen Pingping has no idea that

79
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,600
you've known the truth.

80
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,720
You can accomplish great deeds.

81
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,110
Before going back,

82
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,040
you should visit Zhuang Mohan when you're free.

83
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,110
Inform him of my death.

84
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
I will.

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,320
What else can I do for you?

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,440
After I die, let me sit here.

87
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,880
Don't bury me.

88
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,510
I don't want to be buried under the ground ever again.

89
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,270
OK.

90
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,950
No need to avenge my death.

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,720
Don't provoke Chen Pingping.

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,790
Bury everything deep in your heart,

93
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,230
and live a happy life.

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,000
I know.

95
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,320
Tell me.

96
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,350
Will I see them after I die?

97
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,640
See whom?

98
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,880
Ye Qingmei, and your son?

99
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,640
Yes.

100
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,270
You will see them.

101
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,830
Thank you

102
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
for telling me who I am.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,480
It's a pity that I'm not your grandson.

104
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,760
Sit in peace.

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,000
No one will disturb you anymore.

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,880
So it's for the divine temple.

107
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,270
The secret of Xiao En

108
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,790
is the divine temple.

109
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,040
Wuzhu lost his memory.

110
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,200
Ku He will never

111
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,640
break his promise.

112
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,070
The only hope

113
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,350
to find the divine temple is Xiao En.

114
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,760
He remained silent for years of torture.

115
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,830
Will he really tell Fan Xian?

116
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,000
He will as long as he believes that

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,830
Fan Xian is his grandson.

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,790
That's why for so many years,

119
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,350
you didn't allow me to bring Fan Xian

120
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,510
to the capital city.

121
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,550
Firstly, I wanted to keep Fan Xian safe.

122
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,510
Secondly,

123
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,270
I was waiting for the perfect chance.

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,070
To have Xiao En leave the Investigator's Office

125
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,230
and meet Fan Xian,

126
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,230
everything should make sense.

127
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,760
No trace of manipulation shall be found.

128
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,270
Right.

129
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,270
The timing before the two countries started a war

130
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,920
was the best chance.

131
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,350
When the war ended, win or lose,

132
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,070
Shangshan Hu and Zhuang Mohan

133
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,110
would request to get Xiao En back.

134
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,000
So Fan Xian came to the capital city.

135
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,200
No wonder you left the capital city

136
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,400
on purpose.

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
I thought

138
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,550
I finally found the chance

139
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,030
to bring him to the capital city.

140
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,030
Actually,

141
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,520
it was arranged by you.

142
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,760
His Majesty picked the timing.

143
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,640
Was the Danzhou assassination

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
also planned by His Majesty?

145
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,760
Li Yunrui started the assassination.

146
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
I just made use of the opportunity.

147
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
What if Fan Xian was assassinated?

148
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,910
Have you ever thought about it?

149
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,320
The Sixth Division is in charge of assassination.

150
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,710
Why was the task given to

151
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,280
Teng Zijing of the Fourth Division?

152
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,280
That's because one month before that,

153
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,590
I had sent away all the officials of

154
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,150
the Investigator's Office

155
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,080
around Danzhou,

156
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,790
and Teng Zijing of the Fourth Division was the only one left.

157
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,760
Only he

158
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,350
could fulfill the task.

159
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,030
Was he also

160
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
picked by you in advance?

161
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,520
The officials from the Sixth Division

162
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
are hard-heartened.

163
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,000
They would definitely kill Fan Xian
if they took the secret order.

164
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,910
Whatever Fan Xian might say,

165
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,880
they wouldn't explain.

166
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,350
In the Investigator's Office,

167
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,030
only a few are chivalrous

168
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,550
and dare to defy the authority.

169
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,080
So Teng Zijing

170
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
was one of them.

171
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,110
Teng Zijing was picked by His Majesty.

172
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,320
I thought you've

173
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,400
forgotten me.

174
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,000
What are you reading?

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,030
Stories of Beiqi.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,470
Now that I'm here,

177
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,350
I'd better have further understanding

178
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,790
on the customs here.

179
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,080
You're different than before.

180
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,710
What can I do for you?

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,670
I do have something for you.

182
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,080
But before that,

183
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
I want to ask you a question.

184
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,880
Do you remember Teng Zijing?

185
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,520
Your guard killed

186
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,440
on the Niulan Street?

187
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,280
He had a problem with you.

188
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,840
You were splashed with dirty water on the street,

189
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,520
and your guards hit him.

190
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,590
That's right.

191
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,440
Later, you asked Ministry of Penalty

192
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,440
to arrest Teng Zijing for assassination.

193
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,030
My butler

194
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,030
did that.

195
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,760
I only heard about it.

196
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,960
So you didn't give the order.

197
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,350
Of course I didn't.

198
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,550
How could I trouble myself

199
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,670
for a civilian?

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,590
His entire family was executed for this.

201
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,280
What a heavy sentence!

202
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,400
Neither did you add fuel to the fire behind the back?

203
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,760
Of course not.

204
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,400
I forgot about it the other day.

205
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,080
Fine.

206
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,440
After that,

207
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,320
Teng Zijing was saved by the Investigator's Office

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,280
and sent away from the capital city.

209
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,440
Did you send people

210
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
to harass his wife and son?

211
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,470
What do you mean?

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,520
I am the son of Minister of Board of Rites,

213
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,400
the Imperial Compiler and the follower of the Crown Prince.

214
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,030
I have a bright future ahead.

215
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,760
Why should I do that?

216
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,790
I...

217
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,710
By doing that,

218
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,200
I would ruin my name, wouldn't I?

219
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,710
It was not you.

220
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,030
Of course not.

221
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,320
Trivial as it was,

222
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,080
I forgot it after my guards hit him.

223
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,000
How would I go so far as to destroy his entire family?

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,150
Do you think our family

225
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,520
has no rules?

226
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,200
What a coincidence!

227
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,640
I arrived in the capital city

228
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,520
right at that time.

229
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,000
What?

230
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,910
It was all calculated

231
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,840
only for me

232
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,880
to meet Xiao En.

233
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Xiao En?

234
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,640
Haven't we

235
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,000
given him back to Beiqi?

236
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,080
I believe you didn't lie.

237
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,670
Neither did Teng Zijing.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,320
So all this was set up

239
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,790
by the Investigator's Office.

240
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,640
What do you mean?

241
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,790
What's the relation

242
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,790
between Xiao En and Teng Zijing?

243
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,790
Even if Li Yunrui didn't give

244
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,550
the fake order of assassination,

245
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,230
the Investigator's Office would make sure that

246
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,590
Fan Xian made trouble in Danzhou.

247
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,640
Everybody is

248
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,150
on your chessboard.

249
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,840
We're chess pieces in your game.

250
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,670
It's not my game.

251
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,110
His Majesty is the real chess player.

252
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,520
Even if it's for the divine temple,

253
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,230
is it worth risking

254
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,520
Fan Xian's life?

255
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,960
You know how many secrets

256
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,200
our lady had back then.

257
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Those secrets,

258
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,590
those creative ideas

259
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,470
were all from the divine temple.

260
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,200
It holds resources

261
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,790
and wondrous items

262
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,000
transcending the era.

263
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,880
As long as we have the divine temple,

264
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,840
Nanqing will override any other country

265
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,080
and become the center of the world.

266
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,670
For Nanqing,

267
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,960
any risk is worth taking.

268
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,760
Right.

269
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,030
It's all for Nanqing.

270
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,400
But for Nanqing,

271
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,880
even my son has become a chess piece.

272
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,910
I have nothing to say.

273
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,470
What an old man!

274
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,710
But

275
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,230
I can understand that

276
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,960
he cares for Fan Xian deeply.

277
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,080
I woke up this morning because of a bad dream.

278
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,030
I didn't remember what it was about.

279
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,670
I just woke up with a start.

280
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,000
Your Majesty.

281
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,440
He said

282
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,280
Fan Xian is a chess piece,

283
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,960
but more importantly, he's my son.

284
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,710
Right.

285
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,910
Whatever Your Majesty did

286
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,230
is for Nanqing.

287
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,280
It's worth it.

288
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,520
Fan Jian might not think so.

289
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,110
He really

290
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,000
treats Fan Xian as a son.

291
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,080
He has complaints.

292
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
He'll think it through.

293
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,590
Don't you also

294
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,320
treat Fan Xian as a son?

295
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,150
Yes.

296
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,440
But when I ordered you to withdraw the black knights

297
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,880
to drive him to the last ditch,

298
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,590
you didn't hesitate at all.

299
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,960
I know who I am.

300
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,080
Who are you?

301
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,080
Chen Pingping.

302
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,320
An old dog beside Your Majesty.

303
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,520
Disabled as I am,

304
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,280
I still lead the Investigator's Office

305
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,400
because of Your Majesty's trust.

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,590
I do treat him as a son,

307
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,710
but I'm only loyal

308
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,040
to Your Majesty.

309
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,560
Your Majesty, as long as you give the order,

310
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,310
let alone my son,

311
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
I can give away my life

312
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,830
with a smile.

313
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,590
I heard you.

314
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,520
In the whole country among millions of my subjects,

315
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,070
you're the most loyal

316
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,920
to me.

317
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,880
I know.

318
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,160
I see.

319
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,160
It's late.

320
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm going back.

321
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,880
Your Majesty.

322
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,760
Gong Dian.

323
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,560
Chen Pingping is in the courtyard now.

324
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,590
Follow him.

325
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,760
Find out who he meets

326
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,830
and what they talk.

327
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,710
Monitor Head Chen?

328
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,400
In Nanqing,

329
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,470
I trust you the most.

330
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,950
Your Majesty, I would never fail you.

331
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,070
Let's go back.

332
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,040
Fan Jian,

333
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,830
it's not a good thing to have too many questions.

334
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,280
One thing you should know.

335
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,470
He's still surnamed Fan.

336
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm still his father.

337
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,160
What do you want to ask?

338
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,590
Your Excellency, you're finally back.

339
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,280
How's it going? Are you OK?

340
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,950
Has Yan Bingyun made a move?

341
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,800
No.

342
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,400
He just stays in the room quietly.

343
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,040
Are you still reading the account book?

344
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,000
Is Shen Zhong dead?

345
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,350
No.

346
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,950
I lied to you.

347
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,560
The target of this operation

348
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,000
was not Shen Zhong,

349
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,110
but Shangshan Hu.

350
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,000
Why did you lie to me?

351
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,190
I wanted to know whether you would make a move

352
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,470
when Shen Zhong took the bait.

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,830
You think I might collude with the enemy.

354
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,830
Just as you're suspicious of me,

355
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,400
I also wanted to know

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,430
after being tortured by Embroidered Uniform Guards for so long,

357
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,830
have you yielded

358
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,470
and become Shen Zhong's spy?

359
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,400
Good!

360
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,230
Aren't you angry?

361
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,070
Only by being skeptical

362
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,520
can you be a worthy Director-General

363
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,160
of the Investigator's Office.

364
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
I'm satisfied that

365
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,520
you're skeptical of everything.

366
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,400
What we're going to do next is

367
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,160
to get the secret behind

368
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,350
the account book out of Shen Zhong

369
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,070
and find out

370
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,950
who actually benefit from the dirty money.

371
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,280
I can help you with that,

372
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,710
but you have to return me the favor.

373
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,560
What can I do for you?

374
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,160
I've no idea yet.

375
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,560
We might start from one little thing.

376
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,160
What's that?

377
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,950
Do you understand Chen Pingping?

378
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,590
No one can

379
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,920
truly understand Head Chen.

380
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,640
If Chen Pingping tells a lie,

381
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,680
how true can it be?

382
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,560
Don't you want to ask me something?

383
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,800
Why don't you speak?

384
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,710
If obtaining the divine temple is for the benefits of Nanqing,

385
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,190
which is more important

386
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,110
to you and His Majesty,

387
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,070
Nanqing or Fan Xian?

388
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,070
You can't compare apples and oranges.

389
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,640
If you have to choose between the two,

390
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,350
will you choose Nanqing

391
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,880
or Fan Xian?

392
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,110
Why do we have to choose?

393
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,710
Fan Jian, you should know that

394
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,310
my biggest wish is

395
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,470
to obtain the resources and know the secrets of the divine temple

396
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,560
so as to make Nanqing a long-lasting dynasty.

397
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,430
So,

398
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,040
you'll choose Nanqing.

399
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,350
Why can't we have both?

400
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,520
I just feel that

401
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,800
one day,

402
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,760
we'll have to make such a choice.

403
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,000
I can tell you.

404
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,350
I will choose Fan Xian. I will choose my son.

405
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,110
One last thing.

406
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,520
In your story just now,

407
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,430
you've been avoiding one thing.

408
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,560
Does Xiao En's grandson

409
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,430
really exist?

410
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,070
Yes.

411
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,280
You didn't kill him?

412
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,880
No.

413
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,040
On this matter,

414
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,520
I didn't lie to Xiao En.

415
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,590
I did turn his grandson

416
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,310
into a Nanqing citizen.

417
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,230
I cultivated him into a warrior

418
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,350
who hates Beiqi to the core.

419
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,350
Is he in the Investigator's Office?

420
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,760
Good for you, Chen Pingping.

421
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,560
What's the point of asking me that?

422
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,640
In the Investigator's Office,

423
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,680
how many people are my age?

424
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,880
Why do you ask?

425
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,310
Don't worry. It won't do harm to Nanqing.

426
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,880
There're a lot. I can't tell the number.

427
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,280
For example, we are of the same age.

428
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,160
The Investigator's Office always

429
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
cultivates trusted subordinates when they are little,

430
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,190
so I really can't

431
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,110
tell the number.

432
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,190
What did you just say?

433
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,110
You are also the same age as me?

434
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,310
Right. What's wrong?

435
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,710
Have you ever seen your birth mother?

436
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,680
What kind of a question is that?

437
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,000
Just pretend I'm curious.

438
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,160
My mother passed away when giving birth to me.

439
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
I wasn't lucky enough to see her.

440
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,310
Have you spent much time with your father?

441
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,310
My father is strict with me.

442
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,640
He entrusted me to others

443
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,880
when I was a child.

444
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,230
Though we seldom meet,

445
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,920
it's for my own good.

446
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,710
Is there anything wrong?

447
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,430
So everything is exactly

448
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,560
as he expected.

449
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,230
Teng Zijing was your man.

450
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,920
If he tried to assassinate me,

451
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,000
you would take the blame in the end.

452
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,230
Why do you bring that up?

453
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,230
So,

454
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,000
you were destined

455
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,310
to lurk in Shangjing.

456
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,110
Why was it destined?

457
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,590
Who could predict in advance that

458
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,280
Teng Zijing would take the fake order?

459
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,470
Who could predict in advance?

460
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,520
So he knew in advance that

461
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,590
Xiao En would be used to exchange you.

462
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,110
Even if Xiao En survived

463
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,430
in Beiqi by luck,

464
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,000
you would go back to Nanqing.

465
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,470
No matter how you struggle,

466
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,040
you'll never go beyond his control.

467
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,310
Fan Xian,

468
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,680
what on earth do you want to say?

469
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,830
Xiao En said

470
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,350
Chen Pingping is

471
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,950
a manipulative villain.

472
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,470
Indeed,

473
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,310
everything is under his control.

474
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,830
It's true that Head asked me

475
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,350
to stay and serve you.

476
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,070
It's also you that sent secret messages

477
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,070
to black knights, right?

478
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Who are you?

479
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,680
Why does Chen Pingping

480
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,920
send the black knights for you?

481
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,310
You may not believe

482
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,710
it's the first time for me to hear this name.

483
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,880
Chen Pingping from the Investigator's Office

484
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,680
is publicly known as King of Nights

485
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,190
and the source of all sins.

486
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,000
You prove yourself to be Head of the Investigator's Office.

487
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Nobody else could be

488
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,000
more scheming and calculating than you.

489
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,000
Stay away from the Investigator's Office

490
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,230
in future.

491
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,110
Don't believe Chen Pingping.

492
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,590
What kind of person is he?

493
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,310
He's well known for being resourceful,

494
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,110
capricious and ruthless.

495
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,830
I find it safer inside.

496
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,040
Find more allies.

497
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,040
Don't rely solely on

498
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,230
Chen Pingping.

499
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,470
Tactics...

500
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,430
I'll assist you secretly

501
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,160
to turn you into the No.1 minister

502
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,430
of Nanqing.

503
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,350
No one will be able to jeopardize

504
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,800
your safety by then.

505
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,640
Humanity...

506
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,830
You should wear more. Don't catch a cold.

507
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,710
You have her eyes.

508
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,830
Who is she?

509
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,680
Ye Qingmei. Your mother.

510
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,000
But I'll have to

511
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,680
return it to you after all.

512
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,680
The time may have passed,
but my original intension remains the same.

513
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,400
Tell me

514
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,350
if anything bothers you.

515
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,280
Tell me also

516
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,430
if anyone makes it hard for you.

517
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,070
I'll help you out.

518
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,040
I'll take care of the rest about Lin Gong's issue.

519
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,310
I think you're a good person.

520
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,590
Me? A good person?

521
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,590
Emotion...

522
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,430
These are all chess pieces in his game.

523
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,590
Fan Xian, how can you be

524
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,310
so disrespectful to the Head?

525
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,800
Chen Pingping,

526
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,350
all my life,

527
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,470
it's the first time I fear someone so much.

528
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,430
Your Majesty,

529
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,760
when you were out these days,

530
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,760
everyone inside the imperial palace

531
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,000
was at a loss without the mainstay.

532
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,830
Your Majesty, Director Gong is here.

533
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,070
Let him in.

534
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,230
Your Majesty.

535
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,680
Leave us.

536
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,520
How's it going?

537
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,350
Your Majesty,

538
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,640
Head Chen

539
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,280
ran into Minister Fan

540
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,230
when leaving the Taiping Residence.

541
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,400
What did Head Chen say?

542
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,230
Head Chen told Minister Fan that

543
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,000
he wants to make Nanqing

544
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,310
a long-lasting dynasty.

545
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,230
A long-lasting dynasty?

546
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,110
Head, you look

547
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,190
so exhausted.

548
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,640
I had a heart-to-heart talk.

549
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,070
A heart-to-heart talk?

550
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,400
Well,

551
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,430
I'm fine. Just leave.

552
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,350
Stop.

553
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,680
Yes.

554
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,470
Did Head Chen really say that?

555
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,800
I've remembered every word he said.

556
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,400
I dare not tell a lie.

557
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,880
Head Chen's loyalty to Your Majesty

558
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,590
is second to none.

559
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,040
Second to none?

560
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,830
Turn around.

561
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,680
I've succeeded in making the Armor Piercing Arrow.

562
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,160
What else do you want to say?

563
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,560
Long live Nanqing.

564
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,230
Open your eyes.

565
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,590
Why don't you hide?

566
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,640
Your Majesty, you didn't order me to hide.

567
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,430
To build a long-lasing Nanqing,

568
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,590
I can't do it on my own.

569
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,400
I still have to count on loyal ministers as you.

570
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,040
Rise.

571
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

572
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,640
He's here! He's here!

573
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,400
Just leave. Stop waiting.

574
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,760
Don't shout! Don't shout!

575
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,950
I'll take up your challenges tomorrow.

576
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,110
Come earlier.

577
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,310
Leave!

578
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,560
Leave! Leave! Leave!

579
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,560
Let's come tomorrow.

580
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,920
Fan Xian went back

581
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,880
to the mission alone.

582
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,350
We didn't see Xiao En.

583
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,800
Xiao En is dead.

584
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,280
Are you sure?

585
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,680
His heart arteries were broken.

586
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,400
Even if my master was there,

587
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,680
he wouldn't be able to save Xiao En.

588
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,830
Was there anything unusual in He Daoren's fight?

589
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,000
Nothing unusual.

590
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,880
I'm too suspicious after all.

591
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,230
What did you imply

592
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,400
by saying those words?

593
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,190
Nothing.

594
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,470
As to Head Chen's chess game,

595
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,000
what does it mean?

596
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,190
Where's Xiao En?

597
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,230
He's dead.

598
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,230
Did he tell you the secret

599
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,880
before his death?

600
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,920
Did she marry Emperor Qing?

601
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,430
They didn't hold a wedding ceremony,

602
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,710
but they were actually a couple.

603
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,040
Ye Qingmei was also pregnant

604
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,280
with his baby.

605
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Which do you think is better,

606
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,520
to be a minister

607
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,000
or to be a prince?

608
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,800
What kind of a weird question is that?

609
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,640
The Crown Prince is competing with the Second Prince.

610
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,280
Whoever loses in the end

611
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,400
can only die.

612
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,950
How can we make improper comments

613
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,560
on the imperial family?

614
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,520
In this sense,

615
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,190
it's safer to be a minister.

616
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,280
How can we choose?

617
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,590
Right.

618
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,190
We can't choose our bloodline.

619
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,000
It's destined after all.

620
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,760
Did Xiao En tell you something?

621
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,080
Come here.

622
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,670
Take a seat.

623
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,670
Zhu Ge, Director of the First Division
of the Investigator's Office

624
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,840
followed Li Yunrui

625
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,670
and betrayed the Investigator's Office.

626
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,630
He's dead already.

627
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,560
I've heard.

628
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,430
Now that post

629
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,600
remains vacant.

630
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,910
Do you want to take the post?

631
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,000
Not me.

632
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
It's you.

633
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,190
I'm not qualified.

634
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,120
After finding out the truth of the smuggling,

635
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
you should be qualified.

636
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,280
When we return to the capital city,

637
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,600
I'll try everything I can

638
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,280
to get you the post.

639
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,190
Are you buying me over?

640
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,670
I told you I need your help.

641
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,630
Do you want to form a clique for private gain?

642
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,950
I want to form a clique, but only for public benefits.

643
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,560
The Investigator's Office

644
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,670
is controlled by Chen Pingping

645
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,470
all the time.

646
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,470
It's not a good thing.

647
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,000
Mr. Yan,

648
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,320
can't you do anything

649
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,430
for Nanqing?

650
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,670
Cooperate with me for check and balance.

651
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,230
That's the way to serve our country worthily.

652
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,390
Are you mad?

653
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,430
I've never been so clear.

654
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,470
Do you think I will work with you?

655
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,840
Indeed. I have to wait for the right moment.

656
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,190
You're so ambitious.

657
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,390
I'll tell the Head

658
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,670
after returning to the capital city.

659
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,080
Your Excellency,

660
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,150
there's a woman at the door

661
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,230
wanting to see Mr. Yan.

662
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,800
I told her

663
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,000
Mr. Yan is injured

664
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,950
and it's inconvenient for him to meet visitors.

665
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,910
But she's really stubborn.

666
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,150
I've tried to persuade her for a long time,

667
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,150
but she just wouldn't leave.

668
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,910
Now she's waiting in the yard.

669
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,390
Did she say her name?

670
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,950
She just said she's an old friend of

671
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,870
Mr. Yan,

672
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,430
but she refused to tell who she is.

673
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,710
Gao, thank you. Go and have a rest.

674
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,320
Yes.

675
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,040
Judged from your look,

676
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,040
you don't want to see her, right?

677
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,470
Please stop.

678
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,470
Are you OK?

679
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,430
You're severely injured.

680
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,430
I can see you inside.

681
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,800
No need to come out yourself.

682
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,870
Well,

683
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,150
these are medicines to enrich the blood and heal the wounds.

684
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,230
And here's the medicine for healing the cold.

685
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,520
Some should be taken orally
and the others should be applied externally.

686
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,760
It's all written clearly.

687
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,600
Take them.

688
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,870
Just take them.

689
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,630
I've never loved you.

690
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,280
I... I know.

691
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,230
You've told me.

692
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,230
You approached me

693
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,000
so that you can use my identity

694
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,190
to get military information.

695
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,630
Then why are you here?

696
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,560
I'm just worried about your health.

697
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,600
After all, we know each other.

698
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,080
I can accept your kindness

699
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,430
if you

700
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,710
promise me one condition.

701
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,360
Just go ahead and tell me.

702
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,000
Bring me the head of your elder brother.

703
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,710
If you can place righteousness above family loyalty,

704
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,630
I promise I'll talk to you

705
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,710
as we used to.

706
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,000
We can even be intimate

707
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,000
if you want.

708
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,800
If you couldn't bear to kill him

709
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,670
with a sword, I can give you a poison.

710
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,390
Put it into his tea,

711
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,600
and let him drink it!

712
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,910
If you really don't love her,

713
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,600
you should talk her into

714
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,670
releasing you when you were caught.

715
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,320
What on earth do you want to say?

716
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,120
I think you've left a place

717
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,390
for her in your heart.

718
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,950
As an official of the Investigator's Office,

719
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,040
how can I have heart?

720
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,870
Your Excellency.

721
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,390
You've seen it all?

722
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,470
Yes.

723
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,190
Do you think

724
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,560
Yan Bingyun is really heartless?

725
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,150
I hope so.

726
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
Why?

727
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,390
Just think about it.

728
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,870
Now we are

729
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,800
in the capital of Beiqi.

730
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,150
If we get entangled

731
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,080
with Lady Shen,

732
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,800
Shen Zhong will hate us even more.

733
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,080
Lady Shen came to see Yan Bingyun.

734
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,280
We can't hide it.

735
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,520
Shen Zhong can come if he wants.

736
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,950
I'll wait for him.

737
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,000
Shangshan Hu has already

738
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,230
counted you as his enemy.

739
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,230
Why do you also provoke Shen Zhong?

740
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,120
It's not my style

741
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,230
to keep provoking strong enemies?

742
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,630
Your Excellency,

743
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,190
you were hard to predict,

744
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,950
but you never

745
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,840
asked for trouble.

746
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,630
After coming to the capital city from Danzhou,

747
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,760
I've gone through many things.

748
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,430
Most of the time, trouble found me.

749
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,950
I only responded effectively to the situation,

750
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,000
and I seldom took the initiative.

751
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,000
Do you know why?

752
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,600
No.

753
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,080
Because I only want to

754
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,360
live a happy life.

755
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,080
I want nothing else other than that.

756
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,950
I want to live an easy life.

757
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,840
I've never desired anything.

758
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,470
Nor did I know

759
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,120
my goal for life.

760
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,800
One can be austere if he has no selfish desires.

761
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,670
But now it's different.

762
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,320
Have you found

763
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,080
your goal for life?

764
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,670
Do you know Ye Qingmei?

765
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,760
Yes.

766
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,600
Why was she murdered back then?

767
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,390
I really don't know why.

768
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,710
I originally thought that

769
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,390
by having a successful business

770
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,710
and taking control of the financial power of the world,

771
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,040
she offended someone influential,

772
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,630
so she was murdered.

773
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,600
Is that wrong?

774
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,230
Do you mean Ye Qingmei married into the royal family of Nanqing?

775
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,600
Yeah.

776
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,670
Who did she marry?

777
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,800
He was a prince at that time.

778
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,870
Now, he's the emperor of Nanqing.

779
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,910
Now I see.

780
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,000
As a consort,

781
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,280
she shouldn't die in obscurity.

782
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,560
The truth is hidden by someone.

783
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,390
Since it's a top secret,

784
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,600
petty officials like us are not supposed to know it.

785
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,840
You're right.

786
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,600
So I've got

787
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,670
a goal for my life.

788
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,150
I know what I want to do.

789
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,120
I want to be the Head of the Investigator's Office

790
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,430
and become the most powerful minister in Nanqing.

791
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,140
In the river of history,

792
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,340
time goes round and round.

793
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Memories about the former and present lives

794
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,580
join each other in an endless way.

795
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,180
In the long drunken Milky Way,

796
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,900
one season follows another in a flash,

797
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,100
and the wild geese are flying south.

798
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,020
I just can't give up

799
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,020
to be with you for my whole life.

800
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,300
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

801
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

802
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,980
Year after year in the wandering,

803
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,540
I count the remaining years.

804
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,740
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

805
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,300
even though we have ended up the destiny,

806
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,980
I never feel regretful.

807
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,940
In such a chaotic world,

808
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,700
I still miss you as ever.

809
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,340
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

810
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,060
With a gentle heart,

811
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,620
I cherish our remaining years.

812
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,460
Even though we have to go through

813
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,420
all the hardships along the journey,

814
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:21,740
you always stay by my side,

815
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,500
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

816
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,420
Year after year in the wandering,

817
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,780
I count the remaining years.

818
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,140
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

819
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,940
even though we end up the destiny,

820
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,380
I never feel regretful.

821
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,300
In such a chaotic world,

822
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,260
I still miss you as ever.

823
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,940
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

824
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,700
With a gentle heart,

825
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,100
I cherish our remaining years.

826
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,900
Even though we have to go through

827
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,060
all the hardships along the journey,

828
00:44:53,580 --> 00:45:02,340
you always stay by my side...
