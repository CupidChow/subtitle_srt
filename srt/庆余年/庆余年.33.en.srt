1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 33

16
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,830
Smash it at critical moment.

17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,630
It won't take any lives

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,590
or hurt anyone physically,

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,910
but even Great Masters

20
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,040
will sleep quite a while from it.

21
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,720
Thank you, Teacher!

22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,510
No problem.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,440
Just don't show off with it.

24
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,660
=Si Lili, courtesan of Joy Tsin House=

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,240
The little emperor clearly requires

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,630
to send Si Lili back to Beiqi.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,190
Do they have any private relationship?

28
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,630
Don't stare at her!

29
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,470
The curtain is specially made.

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,910
She can't hear what we're talking about.

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,000
It doesn't make sense.

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,600
If the little emperor

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,630
really has a private relationship with her,

34
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,910
why did he send her to the capital city

35
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,800
as a secret agent?

36
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,260
=Investigator's Office=

37
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,800
Here comes Xiao En.

38
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,620
=Xiao En, former Head of the Beiqi agents=

39
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,110
The smell of sunlight.

40
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,520
Go! Go! Hurry!

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Do you have family?

42
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,240
Tell them to stay alive.

43
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,240
I will find them.

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,390
It's your luck to get out.

45
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,040
Don't irritate the descendants at this time.

46
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,790
You'll regret it

47
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,350
if he kills you by mistake.

48
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,550
If I'm killed,

49
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,880
so will be you son.

50
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,880
You'll regret that.

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,480
Then stay alive and stop flaunting.

52
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,000
Otherwise the Investigator's Office will catch you again.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
Chen Pingping!

54
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,000
Fei Jie!

55
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,230
You are still alive.

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,000
Very good!

57
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,790
I prayed in there that

58
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,160
you can live a long life

59
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,720
so that I can still have the chance of finding you.

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,440
I'll make you dumb with my poison

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,350
if you keep talking rubbish.

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Try it!

63
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,790
My son was poisoned to death

64
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,600
by you in the end.

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,390
What was the poison?

66
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,790
Do you still have it?

67
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,790
What are you laughing at?

68
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,950
What is he laughing at?

69
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,790
I'm laughing at your legs.

70
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,480
They're destroyed by me.

71
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,040
I thought you are laughing at yourself.

72
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,270
As a loser being imprisoned in jail

73
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,350
for so many years

74
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,550
who couldn't move an inch,

75
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,830
do you feel very comfortable?

76
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,270
Hold him!

77
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,670
You're old now.

78
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,670
Control your temper

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
and care for your own health.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,880
Do you really let me go back?

81
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,270
Do you really want to stay?

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,760
You'll regret it.

83
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,510
He is Fan Xian, Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

84
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,390
He'll escort you.

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,950
Nice to see you, Senor Xiao. How are you doing?

86
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,040
Are you going to escort me?

87
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,000
Yup!

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,390
Who are these people to you?

89
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,480
Master Fei is my teacher.

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,920
The Head is my senior friend.

91
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,440
They all treat me like families.

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,670
Take a good look at this kid.

93
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,950
This will be your last chance.

94
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,320
You should take a good look at this yard,

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,550
as you may come back again in the future.

96
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,000
Be careful on the way. You're still too young.

97
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,390
I'll learn from you.

98
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,070
Fan Xian,

99
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,320
the mission and your carriage

100
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,270
are meeting you outside the city.

101
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,880
Thank you!

102
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,880
Please trust me.

103
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,480
I'll surely bring your son back safely

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,670
to the capital city.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,880
Fan Xian,

106
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,270
let's go! I'll walk you there.

107
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,350
You go first.

108
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,070
I need to talk to him in private.

109
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,640
Send your teacher back early.

110
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,510
He's got injury on his body.

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,760
What?

112
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,440
He had a sticky fight

113
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,110
against the Embroidered Uniform
Guards of Shen Zhong in Beiqi.

114
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,550
Upon hearing that you're going to Beiqi,

115
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,110
he rode the horse for 800 miles

116
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,110
to get back to the capital city

117
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,510
and experienced six assassinations,

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,440
but he didn't stop for any single minute.

119
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,350
He wasn't like this in the past.

120
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,390
Your appearance

121
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,070
changed us both.

122
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,790
He should take a rest.

123
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,510
Let me get him back.

124
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,110
Go to the Taiping Residence.

125
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,350
Someone wants to see you.

126
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,100
=Taiping Residence=

127
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,760
It could have not been you

128
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,880
to lead the mission to Beiqi this time.

129
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,760
Then why is it me in the end?

130
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,960
You're young. You should take up the challenge

131
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,590
to cultivate your mind and intelligence.

132
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,960
Your Majesty think I have mental defects?

133
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,670
Do you know

134
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,670
what the missions are this time?

135
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,670
I heard there are a few,

136
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,030
but I am only told

137
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,440
to get Yan Bingyun back.

138
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,230
Nothing else.

139
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,400
Are my missions

140
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,200
assigned by Your Majesty in person?

141
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
They poisoned Si Lili.

142
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,320
Do they mean to kill her on the way?

143
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,910
She won't die.

144
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,470
She is not the target. Someone else is!

145
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,550
It's prepared for the little emperor of Beiqi?

146
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,520
This plan is called Red Sleeve Edict.

147
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,280
I'm afraid it's a death edict.

148
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,840
After getting Yan Bingyun back,

149
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
find a chance to kill Xiao En.

150
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,590
You want me

151
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,710
to kill Xiao En

152
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,230
under the eyes of the Beiqi people?

153
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,080
There doesn't seem to be anything else

154
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,880
other than that.

155
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,590
Kill the emperor and Xiao En

156
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,030
in an alien state.

157
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,960
This is thrilling enough.

158
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,030
And I can tell you

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
the Investigator's Office won't help you

160
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,080
as it may become suspicious as a result.

161
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,080
Your Majesty really flattered me.

162
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,760
What else do you have to say?

163
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,110
I do have a doubt.

164
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,840
Say it!

165
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,470
You can talk to me in the palace as well.

166
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,590
Why do you choose here?

167
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
This is different from the palace.

168
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,710
We're in the monarch-subject relationship in palace,

169
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,320
but here...

170
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,000
What's the difference?

171
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,910
Come back alive.

172
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,880
What did you just say, Your Majesty?

173
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,670
Remember to come back alive.

174
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,640
It doesn't matter

175
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,280
even if the mission fails

176
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,400
as long as I can come back alive?

177
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,350
Don't ask while knowing the answer.

178
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,590
This is my order!

179
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,590
Piss off!

180
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,350
There is merely monarch-subject relationship in the palace.

181
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,590
How different is it

182
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,790
in Taiping Residence?

183
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
You've met His Majesty?

184
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,880
I felt like I've met a fake emperor.

185
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,520
Do you think it's a bit difficult

186
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,710
about the mission this time?

187
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,520
Not really!

188
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,550
Don't worry, Teacher.

189
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,470
Initially, I wanted to go to Beiqi

190
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,640
along with you.

191
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,350
No!

192
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,080
Head Chen has also said

193
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,320
I have killed too many Beiqi agents.

194
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,470
If I go with you,

195
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,320
it may be bad for you.

196
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,280
Just stay in the capital city for a rest.

197
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,200
Wait for my return.

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,470
Pay special attention to such a few people

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,030
when you reach Beiqi.

200
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
One is the

201
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,960
Commander-in-chief of Embroidered
Uniform Guards, Shen Zhong.

202
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,590
Head has told me about him.

203
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,000
The other one is Ku He,

204
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,520
the Great Master.

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,710
I heard that

206
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,320
he doesn't want Xiao En to return to Beiqi.

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,880
Both of them are Beiqi people, aren't they?

208
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,640
Guo Baokun and you are both Nanqing people.

209
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,470
Do you like each other?

210
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,790
Good point!

211
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,710
But what can I do

212
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,110
if the Great Master

213
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,350
wants to plot against me?

214
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,230
He'll respect his own identity.

215
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,110
If he wants to stop Xiao En to return,

216
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,400
he will send his disciples.

217
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,880
Does he have a lot of disciples?

218
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,150
None of them matters

219
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,030
except the one

220
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,080
named Haitang.

221
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,320
That sounds like

222
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,110
a lady's name.

223
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,400
Haitang is also named as Haitang Duoduo.

224
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,280
She is the last disciple of Ku He.

225
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,960
She is

226
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,590
a famous talent in Beiqi

227
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,110
where the people respectfully call her the Saintess.

228
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,760
So it is a lady!

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,760
You're the poetic genius and she is the Saintess.

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
That's tit for tat.

231
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,470
She is said to be ranked as Ninth Dan.

232
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,080
It's quite easy

233
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,960
to become a Ninth Dan master, right?

234
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,030
There are just too many!

235
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,910
A Ninth Dan master is easy to defeat,

236
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,400
but if Ku He really wants

237
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,760
to stop Xiao En from going back

238
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,760
and does it himself,

239
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
we'll have to accept it.

240
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,960
Teacher, you know really a lot

241
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
about Beiqi.

242
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,470
Don't flatter me!

243
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,280
There is one more guy

244
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,910
who is the general of Beiqi, Shangshan Hu.

245
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,790
This guy resists the savages for a number of years

246
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,320
and wins all the battles.

247
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,440
Some said he is bad-tempered.

248
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,320
Some said he is soft and humble.

249
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,030
Isn't that contradictory?

250
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,470
That's the strange part.

251
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,880
Does he have dissociative disorders?

252
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,280
Shangshan Hu is Xiao En's adopted son.

253
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,550
He's been looking forward

254
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,440
to the return of Xiao En.

255
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,840
Then it's not likely for him

256
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
to plot against me.

257
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
After all, I'm escorting his adoptive father back.

258
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,640
Yeah!

259
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,590
He should not plot against you.

260
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,080
Have you baked the meat?

261
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,280
Where is my meat?

262
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,880
Your Excellency,

263
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,110
we have it prepared a long time back.

264
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,860
=Shangshan Hu, Grand General of Beiqi=

265
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,960
Grand General,

266
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,670
we got message from Nanqing.

267
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,790
The Nanqing mission

268
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,960
is sending Mr. Xiao En back.

269
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,880
We can't let my adoptive father

270
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,280
fall in the hands of the throne.

271
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,840
Let's meet them in the territory of Nanqing

272
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,840
and take over him first.

273
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,640
How do we deal with the escorting mission?

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,840
Who is the leader?

275
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,470
Fan Xian, the poetic genius of Nanqing.

276
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I haven't heard of him.

277
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,840
Kill him when they come.

278
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,960
Yes!

279
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,760
Teacher,

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,110
what's the family name of Shangshan Hu?

281
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,960
Is it Shangshan

282
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,110
or Shang?

283
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,520
The mission is up there.

284
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,550
I'll leave you for now.

285
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Sure! Please take a good rest to recover.

286
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,400
Chen Pingping shouldn't have told you that.

287
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,200
Let me give you some more information.

288
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,960
That little emperor of Beiqi

289
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,590
just took over the throne.

290
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,150
The Empress Dowager hasn't handed over the power yet.

291
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,200
There is already inkling between their fight for the throne.

292
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,030
Got it!

293
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,320
It's a good chance to take advantage

294
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,880
from the battle between a mother and a son.

295
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,200
I intend to ask you to escape

296
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,110
while they're fighting.

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,670
Do you want to

298
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,790
get involved into

299
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,520
the political affairs of Beiqi?

300
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,280
No! No! No!

301
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,760
I didn't mean it.

302
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,550
Well...

303
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,590
It's not easy

304
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,280
to get infected with Si Lili's poison.

305
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,110
It can only be infected

306
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,320
when there are intimate contacts

307
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,350
such as tongue kisses.

308
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,550
You know that as well?

309
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,440
It was I who compounded

310
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,470
the Red Sleeve Edict poison.

311
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,160
You have awesome skills, Teacher!

312
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,560
The No. 1 poison expert in the world.

313
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,520
What's this?

314
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,070
The antidote to Si Lili's poison.

315
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,950
It has a manual about its usage.

316
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,350
I'm just afraid that you might not be able to hold it

317
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,230
and get poisoned yourself.

318
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,830
You can use this to save yourself.

319
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,040
How can I get poisoned?

320
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,830
What do you mean that I'm not able to hold it?

321
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,680
Teacher, I'm a decent man.

322
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,880
I don't have any dirty thoughts on her.

323
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
You're a decent man.

324
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,190
I'm leaving now.

325
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,590
One final reminder.

326
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,800
Don't lose your life.

327
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,190
Otherwise, I'll go to the capital city of Beiqi myself

328
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,400
and slaughter the whole city

329
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,350
for you.

330
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't worry, Teacher.

331
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,070
I'll surely come back alive.

332
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,880
Why are you here?

333
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,680
We already said goodbye

334
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,520
at home, didn't we?

335
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,800
I'm not here to say goodbye.

336
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,950
I'm here to urge you

337
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,680
because you become negligent recently.

338
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,070
What do you mean?

339
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,800
The book!

340
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,560
You are very slow now with the book.

341
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Danbo Bookstore

342
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,590
is in urgent need of your new chapters

343
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,000
for the Red Mansions.

344
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,950
If it weren’t for the poem anthology

345
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,710
the other day,

346
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,000
we would have nothing to publish now.

347
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,560
I've been quite busy recently.

348
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,950
I don't care!

349
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,110
That's an excuse.

350
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,560
There isn't much to do

351
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,230
for your trip to Beiqi.

352
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,560
Spare some time every day

353
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,470
and finish a part.

354
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,310
Once you finish,

355
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,800
send it to me by post-horses.

356
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,680
Write more about the romantic stuff

357
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,280
like you love me but I don't love you.

358
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,430
The ladies from wealthy and influential families

359
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,430
like that.

360
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,950
No wonder you followed me here.

361
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,350
Brother, don't worry.

362
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,400
I'll move to Wan'er's place tomorrow.

363
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,680
Why?

364
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,070
To protect my future sister-in-law for you.

365
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,680
I'll stop her from seeing anyone else.

366
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,350
That's outrageous.

367
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,760
Shall I go or not?

368
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,310
You should!

369
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,800
Beat the hell out of those who ingratiate Wan'er.

370
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,920
Sure, I got it!

371
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,950
As the elder brother,

372
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,280
you have set a wrong example.

373
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,590
Let's call it expression of nature.

374
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,560
You're about to visit Beiqi.

375
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,680
Why are you still so naughty?

376
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
These are my bodyguards.

377
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,950
=Gao Da, Commander of Tiger guards of Nanqing=
All of them are state-of-the-art.

378
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,400
They will go to Beiqi

379
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,350
along with you this time.

380
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,800
You keep so many guards

381
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,230
as an Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue?

382
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,280
Gao Da and the swordsmen under him

383
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,040
are very reliable.

384
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,110
You can entrust them with

385
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,520
whatever you want to do.

386
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,430
I'm at Your Excellency's service.

387
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,190
How to spell your name?

388
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,560
G-A-O,
(The name is the Chinese

389
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,830
D-A!
translation of 'Gundam')

390
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,310
I have long desired to know you.

391
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,590
Your Excellency have heard of me before?

392
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,520
I kept a small horse in Danzhou.

393
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,310
It is named as Zaku.
(a type of robot from Mobile Suit Gundam)

394
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,470
I'll arrange a meeting for you

395
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,640
when I get the time.

396
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,160
Do we need to take a detour

397
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,680
to Danzhou?

398
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,190
I mean next time.

399
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,710
Alright! Forget about him.

400
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
He usually behaves himself strangely.

401
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
Take care of him

402
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,280
during the trip.

403
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,310
Sure!

404
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,520
Wait outside the gate.

405
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,640
Don't show off or take any risks.

406
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,110
Just remember

407
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,640
you have families in the capital city

408
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,800
waiting for you to come back.

409
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,110
Brother,

410
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,350
drink up this bowl of farewell liquor.

411
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,190
What are you doing?

412
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,350
He's not going to a battlefield.

413
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,280
I think it's pretty much like it.

414
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,310
Let's go!

415
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,430
Sure, Your Excellency!

416
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,350
Watch the road. Don't get distracted.

417
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,070
Stop the carriage! Take a break!

418
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,800
Your Excellency,

419
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,590
where are you going?

420
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,430
You don't need to know it.

421
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,830
Allow me to come along.

422
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,560
I've got a nature's call.

423
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,800
So have I.

424
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,040
I want to poop.

425
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,350
So do I.

426
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,350
Your Excellency, do you want

427
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,760
to quit from the trip?

428
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,710
You are afraid to make any trouble

429
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,880
so you want to escape?

430
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,160
So in your eyes, I am a trouble?

431
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,040
Your Excellency, if you are escaping,

432
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,520
please bring me along.

433
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,430
I don't want to go either.

434
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,520
I'm wiser than them all.

435
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,470
I know how to behave in delicate situations.

436
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,350
Gao Da!

437
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,040
Yes!

438
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,230
Your Excellency!

439
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,640
I'm going to answer the call of nature.

440
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,710
Stay here for further command

441
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,560
and watch the carriage.

442
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,880
No one shall leave.

443
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,950
Yes!

444
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,040
Your Excellency!

445
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
Uncle Wuzhu.

446
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,350
According to what you said,

447
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,710
I went to Taiping Residence.

448
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,000
How was it?

449
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,400
The defense is really strict.

450
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,520
You didn't get in?

451
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,680
I got in,

452
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,560
but I'm afraid

453
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,760
it's not possible

454
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,880
to escape along with you.

455
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,160
Did you get under water?

456
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,920
Did you see the mechanism left by my mom?

457
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,110
It's a bit wired.

458
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,230
What is it like?

459
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,680
When I jumped up into the sky,

460
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,400
I found the stone

461
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,280
is actually the key.

462
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,520
It's hard to describe it clearly.

463
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,280
I always feel that

464
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
you're the only one

465
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,950
in the world

466
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,350
who can understand the mechanism

467
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
left by your mom!

468
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,800
You have to wait

469
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,760
till I get back to the capital city.

470
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,230
Do you really want to open that secret door?

471
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,680
Didn't you say

472
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,110
we'll be in grave danger

473
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,830
once we know the truth?

474
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,520
I know,

475
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,950
but what mankind can't beat

476
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,430
is the curiosity

477
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,710
to the unknown.

478
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,000
Anyway, curiosity kills the cat.

479
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,640
Sure!

480
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,230
What the lady left

481
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,190
in the case

482
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,710
are weapons, aren't they?

483
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,160
Why don't you bring them to Beiqi?

484
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,350
I left them at home.

485
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,400
Take care of them for me.

486
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm also leaving.

487
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,040
Where are you going?

488
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,880
To the north.

489
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,950
Are you going to Beiqi along with me?

490
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,310
I'll go first.

491
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,070
Why?

492
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
Just now Fei Jie said

493
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,350
Ku He will possibly plot against you.

494
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,800
It's only a possibility.

495
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,640
Why do you look for Ku He?

496
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,950
To fight!

497
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,160
Uncle...

498
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,400
To beat him till he's not able to harm you.

499
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,110
He is the Great Master!

500
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,950
The Great Master is who I want to beat.

501
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,520
That's really daring.

502
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,710
I don't care about anyone

503
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,430
under the level of Great Masters.

504
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,110
I see! Leave them to me.

505
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,590
So, we'll meet in Beiqi, right?

506
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,400
I must drag down Ku He

507
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,190
and therefore can't go to the capital of Beiqi.

508
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,680
We won't meet then.

509
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,000
Be safe!

510
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,070
The last point.

511
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,310
I seem to remember

512
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,430
the name Xiao En.

513
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,920
What do you mean?

514
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,560
The lady used to travel with Xiao En.

515
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,110
My mom?

516
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,880
She also told me that

517
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,800
she came to this world

518
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,310
because of Xiao En.

519
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,190
What else?

520
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,040
That's all I can remember.

521
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,710
So perhaps Xiao En knows

522
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,880
the secrets of my mom.

523
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,110
You can ask him yourself.

524
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,920
But the order I got is to kill...

525
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,880
But the order I got is to kill him.

526
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,520
There you come, Your Excellency!

527
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,310
What's up?

528
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,950
Your Excellency,

529
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,920
Where did you find this guy?

530
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,680
You mean Wang Qinian?

531
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,000
What's wrong with him?

532
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,000
While the mission was distributing solid food,

533
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,880
he stole the fruits in stock.

534
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,880
He is sneaky-behaved and filthy and greedy in personality.

535
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,160
Your Excellency, we can't keep people like this.

536
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,880
I'll talk to him about this.

537
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,920
Thank you for reminding me.

538
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,110
Your Excellency,

539
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,830
let me do it if you want to drive him away.

540
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,590
OK!

541
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,280
Go ahead with your business.

542
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,760
Your Excellency,

543
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,710
you are back.

544
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,520
Are you going to eat

545
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,760
the solid food distributed just now?

546
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,710
No!

547
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,350
Your Excellency,

548
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,310
do you know what I found?

549
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,880
What?

550
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,110
I found

551
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,920
there are fresh fruits

552
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,800
in the luggage cart of the mission.

553
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,110
They are delivered here by post-horses.

554
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,350
I've taken some for you.

555
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,000
Wang Qinian,

556
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,160
I am the leader of the mission.

557
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,160
Do I need to steal the fruits?

558
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,760
Your Excellency,

559
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,040
these fruits are kept

560
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,190
with ice cubes.

561
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,040
They are gifts

562
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,160
we send to Beiqi, sort of.

563
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,880
But they are more and more uncommon

564
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
as we go further and further into the north.

565
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,560
You just took the gifts

566
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,470
between two states.

567
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,350
Nobody will count them.

568
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,160
It won't be detected if only we take a few.

569
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,680
It's not a big deal

570
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,640
to take a few fruits

571
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,350
given all the hardship on the way.

572
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,400
No, I won't take them!

573
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,230
Thank you!

574
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,310
It's alright!

575
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,280
Go! Go!

576
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,040
Go!

577
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,190
Your Excellency, take some!

578
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Don't feel sorry for it.

579
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,400
I'll get you a few more.

580
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,560
Don't worry.

581
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,400
I'll be your sentry.

582
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,560
It's not easy to stay in this position.

583
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,000
Go! Go!

584
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,400
There is not much time left. Hurry up with it!

585
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,160
Dad! Dad!

586
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,880
What are you doing here?

587
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,920
I was worried that you'll suffer.

588
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,760
This is insane!

589
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,950
I told you to break off

590
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,800
all relations with me.

591
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,800
Dad!

592
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,760
Did they beat you or insult you?

593
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,040
I am an official anyway.

594
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,880
They treated me well.

595
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,710
You don't need to worry.

596
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,400
Go!

597
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,310
Dad!

598
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,110
I tried to bribe a lot of people,

599
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,230
but got refused.

600
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,520
Every one of them prevaricated

601
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,680
and refused to help.

602
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,070
Silver won't help. It's useless to try.

603
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,800
Dad, I've hired a bunch of killers.

604
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,680
They are the best of their kind.

605
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,800
What are you doing?

606
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,280
Fan Xian went to Beiqi with a mission.

607
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,190
That's a perfect chance.

608
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,760
I'll follow behind him

609
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,040
and initiate an attack

610
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,110
to take his life

611
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,800
when they get to the wilderness

612
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,110
so as to retaliate for you.

613
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,590
You must stop that.

614
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,680
Dad, don't worry.

615
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,710
I've read a lot of book on the art of war

616
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,950
and studied a lot of examples of battles.

617
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,470
They give me a lot of insights.

618
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,000
Now it looks like

619
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,520
I have the potential

620
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,710
to become a good general in the world.

621
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,310
That's not possible.

622
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,830
Don't do silly things.

623
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,400
This is not silly.

624
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,280
The patrol is coming. Leave now!

625
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,920
Dad, wait for my news.

626
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,110
No, don't do that.

627
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,560
It's dangerous to you.

628
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,760
Are you a beggar?

629
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,830
Do I look like one?

630
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,070
Are you a beggar?

631
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,430
Beggar...

632
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,470
Excuse me! Excuse me!

633
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,360
Are you a beggar?

634
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,870
I'm not only a beggar, but also a cook.

635
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,280
I'm Zhao Da!

636
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,630
Are they all here?

637
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
Set off now.

638
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,950
Fan Xian has already gone out of town.

639
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,470
Wait a moment, Young Master! They are on the way.

640
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,080
I told you to gather them here

641
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,560
in the capital city!

642
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,600
It's harvest time in the countryside.
They will come after that.

643
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,950
Well...

644
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,630
Take a seat! Sit down!

645
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,190
Young Master,

646
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,280
all of us are veterans

647
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,950
retired from the frontiers.

648
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,910
We have farm work only after we got back.

649
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,760
Generally,

650
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,670
we'd also help with

651
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,230
weddings and funerals

652
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,630
so that we have sustenance.

653
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,710
But don't worry, Your Excellency!

654
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,470
We're most adept

655
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,910
in murdering and robbing

656
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,840
without any mistakes.

657
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Fan Xian has already gone!

658
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,390
It's a sure thing!

659
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,190
The mission can't travel fast.

660
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,560
We can catch up with them
even if we set off a few days later.

661
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,520
Are you sure?

662
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,910
The Patrol Division has to stop from here.

663
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,800
We'll have to rely on ourselves

664
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,150
further to the north.

665
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,080
There shouldn't be any danger

666
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,560
in our own territory.

667
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,000
But Xiao En is infamous.

668
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,040
Your Excellency,

669
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,840
we must beware of him all the time.

670
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,560
I poison him every day.

671
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,000
It's better to have someone

672
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,800
watching over him all the time.

673
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,280
But I have to look out for the surroundings.

674
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,280
My guards fear him

675
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,390
as much as they fear tigers

676
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,760
and dare not to approach.

677
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,360
Totally understandable.

678
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,760
By the way, Your Excellency,

679
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,710
I saw Wang Qinian

680
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,630
stealing fruits again.

681
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,600
You bumped into him again?

682
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,190
I watch over him all the time.

683
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,630
Your Excellency, we can't let him stay.

684
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,560
If Your Excellency feels embarrassed,

685
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,390
I can be the bad guy and drive him away.

686
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,710
Not necessary!

687
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,630
Why?

688
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,710
Actually, all of his behaviors of such

689
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,230
are an illusion.

690
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,560
He is a first-class

691
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,360
warrior.

692
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,230
Brave and perseverant!

693
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,120
Is that true?

694
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,390
That's...

695
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,230
To be frank,

696
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,190
I'm also worried that

697
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,230
there will be accident

698
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,710
to leave Xiao En alone

699
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
in the carriage.

700
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,190
As soon as I said that,

701
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,870
Wang Qinian volunteered

702
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,230
to take the same carriage with Xiao En

703
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,000
for the rest of the journey

704
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,950
so as to set an example for the mission.

705
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,120
Did he really say that?

706
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,950
Absolutely!

707
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,320
Warrior Wang,

708
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,430
I'm sorry.

709
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,520
For what?

710
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,390
I have been misled at the start

711
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,000
by the illusions you put up.

712
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,630
Now it seems

713
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,470
you're the true hero.

714
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
I'm flattered!

715
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,080
Xiao En killed people massively

716
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
in a cruel and ruthless manner.

717
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,630
He is a real devil on earth.

718
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,710
He is indeed unforgiveable.

719
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,600
You are the only one

720
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,630
who has no fear towards him.

721
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,040
How can you tell that?

722
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,840
Your voluntary move

723
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,280
is no different from

724
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,560
feeding yourself to a tiger.

725
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,430
I truly admire it.

726
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm flattered!

727
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,080
From now on,

728
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,840
we are sworn brothers

729
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,190
through thick and thin.

730
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,560
Should you have any misfortune,

731
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,910
I'll surely kill Xiao En

732
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,560
to avenge you.

733
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,360
Your Excellency,

734
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,710
did this guy take the poisonous mushroom?

735
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,000
Actually, he bumped into

736
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,000
your stealing of the fruits.

737
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,520
And he still admires me?

738
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,230
Then,

739
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,910
I kind of helped you out with a few good words.

740
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,520
Mr. Xiao,

741
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,600
I'll stay with you

742
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,760
from today onwards.

743
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,600
I got some warm water for you

744
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,760
for a comfortable face wash.

745
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,430
Do you think

746
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,190
it will work

747
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,600
if I kidnap you as a hostage

748
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,390
to threaten that young guy?

749
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,840
Mr. Xiao,

750
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,470
since they assigned me here,

751
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,670
it means

752
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,560
I'm a person

753
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,280
of little importance.

754
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,430
Right?

755
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,150
Why would the lords

756
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,080
out there

757
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,430
care about my life?

758
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,430
Let me clean your face.

759
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,080
Do you massage?

760
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,150
You want massage?

761
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,800
Aren't you afraid of me?

762
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,150
Your reputation is widely-spread.

763
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,230
Of course, I'm afraid.

764
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,800
What if I kill you?

765
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,870
His Excellency Fan is very rich.

766
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,390
My wife and daughter

767
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,190
will live a good life.

768
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,870
What's your name?
(What are you screaming for?)

769
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,760
I didn't scream!

770
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,190
I didn't!

771
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,600
I mean what's your name?

772
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,560
My name is...

773
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,600
Wang Qinian.

774
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,080
Wang Qinian!

775
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,190
I got it.

776
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,600
Come on! This side.

777
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,760
Here. This side.

778
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,860
In the river of history,

779
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,060
time goes round and round.

780
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,420
Memories about the former and present lives

781
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,300
join each other in an endless way.

782
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,900
In the long drunken Milky Way,

783
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,620
one season follows another in a flash,

784
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,820
and the wild geese are flying south.

785
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,740
I just can't give up

786
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,740
to be with you for my whole life.

787
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,020
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

788
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,820
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

789
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,700
Year after year in the wandering,

790
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,260
I count the remaining years.

791
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,460
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

792
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,020
even though we have ended up the destiny,

793
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,700
I never feel regretful.

794
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,660
In such a chaotic world,

795
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,420
I still miss you as ever.

796
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,060
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

797
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,780
With a gentle heart,

798
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,340
I cherish our remaining years.

799
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,180
Even though we have to go through

800
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,140
all the hardships along the journey,

801
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:32,460
you always stay by my side,

802
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,220
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

803
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,140
Year after year in the wandering,

804
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,500
I count the remaining years.

805
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,860
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

806
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,660
even though we end up the destiny,

807
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,100
I never feel regretful.

808
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,020
In such a chaotic world,

809
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,980
I still miss you as ever.

810
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,660
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

811
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,420
With a gentle heart,

812
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,820
I cherish our remaining years.

813
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,620
Even though we have to go through

814
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,780
all the hardships along the journey,

815
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:13,060
you always stay by my side...
