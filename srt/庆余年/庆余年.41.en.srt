1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
it was impossible to go back.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

15
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

16
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 41

17
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,590
So, black knights were withdrawn

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,630
so that Fan Xian got into trouble

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,950
because you gave the order, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,440
If you want to kill Fan Xian,

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
you just need to issue an imperial edict.

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,440
It's unnecessary to drag in so many people

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,870
and even send him to Beiqi.

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,080
In the final analysis,

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,160
he's just a common official.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
His life is up to you.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,440
His Majesty sent Fan Xian there

28
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,480
to get the secret out of Xiao En.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,310
How is it related to Fan Xian?

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
Xiao En has said nothing over the years.

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,390
Will he tell Fan Xian about it?

32
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,670
I think so.

33
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,190
You're not bleeding.

34
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,240
Haven't you laughed enough?

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,720
Life is full of mysteries and surprises.

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,270
Did you save me to get that secret?

37
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,190
I've given up on it.

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,360
I saved you for Shangshan Hu.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,160
I fooled him once,

40
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,160
so I have to save you

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,270
if I want him to listen to me again.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,520
It makes sense.

43
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,520
You're decisive and cruel.

44
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,110
You're young,

45
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,600
but you'll have a promising future.

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,800
But it's of no use.

47
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,080
The wound left by Langtao is so deadly that

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,030
even I can't save you.

49
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,360
It's true you're dying.

50
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,240
In this case,

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,270
I'll tell you

52
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,190
the secret.

53
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,550
Tell me?

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,750
It's a secret,

55
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,190
but actually, it's something simple.

56
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,880
Wait!

57
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,880
What?

58
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm going to tell you about it.

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,270
Don't you want to listen?

60
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,270
You have no reason to do that.

61
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,190
I'm dying.

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,720
Maybe I don't want the secret

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,910
to be buried with me.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,830
If that were

65
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,880
what worries you,

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,550
you must've told

67
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,440
the Investigator's Office about it.

68
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
Maybe it's because of destiny

69
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,240
since it was you that took me back to Beiqi.

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,000
And, maybe it's because

71
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm moved because you saved me.

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,320
You didn't give in even if they threatened to kill you.

73
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,000
How could you change your mind because of a little favor?

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,600
Besides, I aimed to take advantage of you.

75
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,030
You're not that kind of person.

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,240
How did you know

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm not that kind of person?

78
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sure about it

79
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,320
because we're the same kind of person.

80
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,880
We're pragmatic, cruel and heartless.

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,040
Well said.

82
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,760
We're the same kind of person.

83
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,440
The same kind.

84
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,230
So, you have no reason

85
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,390
to tell me the top secret.

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,350
Were you brought up in Danzhou?

87
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,600
Yes.

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,790
So, it's not been a long time since you went to the capital city.

89
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,200
That's right.

90
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,920
Were you promoted to be Director-General

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,350
of the Investigator's Office in a short time?

92
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,350
Exactly.

93
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,230
Who's your father?

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,350
He's called Fan Jian.

95
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,070
Fan Jian.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,920
What does he do?

97
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,950
He serves as Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

98
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,110
I remember.

99
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,270
Chen Pingping and he know each other well.

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,830
So what?

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,670
Now that Fan Jian has been staying in the capital city,

102
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,510
why were you left in Danzhou?

103
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,640
Is it related to you?

104
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,670
Because I'm a bastard.

105
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,350
Who is your mother?

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,600
She's dead when I was born.

107
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,920
So you've never seen her.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,160
What on earth do you want to say?

109
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,920
Do you know

110
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
your mother was murdered?

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,000
Of course I do.

112
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,950
Fan Jian is not your biological father.

113
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,000
Your real father

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
died long ago.

115
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
What?

116
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
Kid,

117
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,950
my son is your father.

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
You're my grandson.

119
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,480
What the heck?

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,480
I might be the last of my family line.

121
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,390
You can say that

122
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm dying sonless.

123
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,510
What did Shen Zhong do to you?

124
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,160
I know.

125
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,350
You may have doubts more or less.

126
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,230
Come on.

127
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,830
It's sheer nonsense.

128
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,790
Xiao En's grandson?

129
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,760
Chen Pingping, are you muddleheaded?

130
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,880
When Xiao En was caught,

131
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,640
both his son and his daughter-in-law

132
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,720
died on the spot.

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,270
How could he have a grandson?

134
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,480
Before getting married,

135
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Xiao En's son

136
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,200
stayed with another woman.

137
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,950
Who was she?

138
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,040
She was a prostitute.

139
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,110
Xiao En's son bought back her freedom

140
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,320
and hid her in a private house. Then she got pregnant.

141
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,230
When Xiao En found it out,

142
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,790
he ordered his son to break up with her

143
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,950
because he was strict with his son.

144
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,070
Then he asked his son

145
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,640
to marry a girl

146
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,920
from a family of equal status.

147
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,110
By rights, such a woman

148
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,270
should be killed to avoid trouble later on.

149
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,510
But she was pregnant, anyway.

150
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,320
So I hid her somewhere,

151
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,230
I wanted to decide whether to kill her or not

152
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,110
after she gave birth.

153
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,480
She's your mother.

154
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,790
She was sold into a brothel when she was very young

155
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,110
and she didn't know her real name.

156
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,440
When she was in the whorehouse,

157
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,040
she was called Yuxiang.

158
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,200
It became her name.

159
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,230
Yuxiang? Come on.

160
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,320
What the heck are you talking about?

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,640
Since I was arrested,

162
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,480
I'd been cruelly tortured.

163
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,230
The only thing that made me want to live

164
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,270
is that kid.

165
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,270
But in the end,

166
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,270
Chen Pingping found it out.

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Didn't they kill him?

168
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,320
If you die,

169
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,110
I'd find no point

170
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,320
in living anymore.

171
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,350
During that period,

172
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,040
he kept

173
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,760
telling me something about you

174
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,480
to sound me out and threaten me.

175
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,160
But you said nothing.

176
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,670
If I had, both of us would've died.

177
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,670
Only by keeping silent

178
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,720
would you be safe.

179
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,640
At that time,

180
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
I wanted to push Xiao En

181
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,720
to tell us the secret

182
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
by threatening to kill that kid.

183
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,160
And then?

184
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,950
What tortures a person most is not threats,

185
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,200
but hope.

186
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,110
His Majesty is far-sighted.

187
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,000
No one else can match him.

188
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,510
It's true that

189
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,270
Xiao En wouldn't give in

190
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,790
to threats.

191
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,230
Finally,

192
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
as His Majesty suggested,

193
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,470
I told Xiao En I'd make the kid

194
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,960
become one of Nanqing people

195
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,030
and a solider

196
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,760
that hates Beiqi.

197
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,030
I said I'd let the kid

198
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,470
ruin all his hopes

199
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,110
when the kid grows up.

200
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,320
That's malicious.

201
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,520
It's your style.

202
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,110
That's why he believed.

203
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,840
Over the years,

204
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,440
I told him

205
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,550
all little things

206
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,470
about the kid.

207
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,880
Did you tell him

208
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,320
the kid was brought up in Danzhou?

209
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,520
No, I didn't.

210
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,590
He didn't say where you were living,

211
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
but he didn't know

212
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,640
I'm familiar with

213
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,110
many cities of Nanqing

214
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,400
to better fight against them.

215
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,710
So,

216
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,550
according to all the details

217
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,790
and the layout of streets

218
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,760
he revealed by accident,

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,910
I'm sure you were in Danzhou.

220
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,880
You guessed?

221
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,150
I put all the fragmented information together

222
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,840
and then found the answer.

223
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,000
I couldn't get it wrong.

224
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,840
Xiao En is suspicious and confident by nature.

225
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,840
If I told him it's Danzhou,

226
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
he couldn't believe it.

227
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,470
I have to let him guess the answer.

228
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,910
Then he'd have no doubts.

229
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,550
What if he failed to guess it?

230
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,400
He's smart.

231
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,200
A smart person

232
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,030
considers himself always right.

233
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,080
I guessed you were in Danzhou,

234
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,910
but I'd never showed any signs.

235
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Danzhou is a big place.

236
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,590
Why is it me?

237
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,960
You're at the right age.

238
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,840
There are lots of guys at my age.

239
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,520
It's you that took me back to Beiqi.

240
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,590
So what?

241
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
If Chen Pingping

242
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,590
wanted to advance your career,

243
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
he couldn't have withdrawn black knights.

244
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,910
The Investigator's Office is powerful.

245
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,880
They must've guessed

246
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Hu'er would come to save me.

247
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,790
He withdrew black knights

248
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,470
to let you deal with that all alone

249
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,200
just because

250
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,640
he wanted to see me kill you.

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,640
He is Fan Xian, Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

252
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,640
He'll escort you.

253
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,960
Nice to see you, Senior Xiao.

254
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,440
Are you going to escort me?

255
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,440
Yup!

256
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,400
Who are these people to you?

257
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,470
Master Fei is my teacher.

258
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
The Head is my senior friend.

259
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,550
They all treat me like families.

260
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,590
Take a good look at this kid.

261
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,030
This will be your last chance.

262
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,550
It doesn't make sense.

263
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,960
Let me guess.

264
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,230
They asked you to kill me

265
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,520
on the way here, right?

266
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Don't you think they're contradictory?

267
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,910
They wanted you to kill me

268
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,470
but they didn't care about your safety.

269
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
So, who on earth did he want to kill?

270
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Either.

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You kill me

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
or I kill you.

273
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,880
He'd be glad to see either of us die.

274
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,280
If I kill you,

275
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,520
he'll tell me the truth

276
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,470
and let me realize

277
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,200
I've killed my only grandson.

278
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,230
There is nothing

279
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,910
crueler than that.

280
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,320
It's just a guess.

281
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,910
But it makes sense.

282
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,960
In this case,

283
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,670
everything makes sense.

284
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,520
Over the years,

285
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,760
they left you alone in Danzhou, showing no interest at all.

286
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,350
But suddenly, you were transferred to the capital city

287
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,350
and promoted quickly.

288
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,640
They just wanted to create an opportunity

289
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,150
so that we hurt each other.

290
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,960
Besides,

291
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,230
why didn't they disable me before I left

292
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,470
so that I can't use my martial arts?

293
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,080
Because they want to see me kill you

294
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,470
and regret it.

295
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,710
Do you have any concrete evidence?

296
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,670
Such as a jade pendant or a birthmark

297
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,550
that can prove my identity.

298
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,230
No.

299
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,470
Why didn't you prepare

300
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,110
some concrete evidence?

301
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,320
Keep your voice down.

302
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,080
You scared the fish away.

303
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,150
It's His Majesty's idea.

304
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,080
What's most amazing about it

305
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,550
is that no concrete evidence is prepared.

306
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,000
The more concrete evidence there is, the more suspicious he'd be.

307
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,840
The more contradictions I created,

308
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,350
the more convinced he'd be of Fan Xian's identity.

309
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,760
What a good plan!

310
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,440
A battlefield of human feelings

311
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,880
is most breathtaking.

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,910
But this is how things are.

313
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,030
You're intelligent.

314
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,440
You must understand

315
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,550
what I said is true.

316
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,640
The only thing Chen Pingping got wrong

317
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,840
is that he didn't expect

318
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,880
I've guessed

319
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,030
you were in Danzhou.

320
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,000
In the end, the only loophole

321
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,960
made me

322
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,880
find out the truth

323
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,960
and stop us from fighting against each other.

324
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
That's why

325
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,550
you stopped Shangshan Hu killing me at that time?

326
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,670
Yes.

327
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,590
But you said nothing later

328
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,880
on the way.

329
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,110
Would you believe it if I had told you suddenly?

330
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,670
But you're telling me about it now.

331
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,640
Because I'm dying.

332
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,110
No matter if you believe it or not,

333
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,710
I have to tell you the truth.

334
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,640
There is something weird.

335
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,760
Why did Chen Pingping do so much

336
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,520
to torture you?

337
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,840
Because it was me

338
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,790
that broke his legs that year.

339
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,550
He hates me like poison.

340
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,280
When a person like Chen Pingping

341
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
holds a grudge against someone,

342
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,150
he wouldn't let it go

343
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,790
even if 10 or 100 years have passed.

344
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,910
He'd take revenge no matter how long he has to wait.

345
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,790
Xiao En knows me well.

346
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,760
He knows that once I hate someone,

347
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,520
I'd never forget about it.

348
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,520
But there is one thing he got wrong.

349
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,400
I don't hate him.

350
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,790
I caught him and killed his family,

351
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,280
so he broke my legs.

352
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,320
It's fair.

353
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,230
I have no reason to hate him.

354
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,910
If I didn't mishear it,

355
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,520
you began to make up lies

356
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,760
soon after you caught him.

357
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
Yes.

358
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,550
You've never stopped doing that over the years.

359
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,880
They became more convincing as time went by.

360
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,670
You used Fan Xian as a pawn

361
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,280
while he was just a baby.

362
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,590
You know, it's not easy

363
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,840
to deceive a smart person.

364
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
It takes a long time.

365
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,520
Have you ever thought about the risks?

366
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,880
What if black knight were withdrawn

367
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,230
and Xiao En was not that smart?

368
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,320
What if he didn't get fooled

369
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,470
and really killed Fan Xian?

370
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,470
What would you do?

371
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,030
Xiao En wouldn't believe it

372
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,350
unless black knights were withdrawn.

373
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,790
So, you're

374
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,910
risking Fan Xian's life?

375
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,910
Are you done yet?

376
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,440
He's Ye Qingmei's son.

377
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,880
Do you know

378
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,200
what on earth

379
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,590
Xiao En's secret is about?

380
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,550
The secret I mentioned

381
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,150
is about a place

382
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,640
and a person.

383
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,280
Have you heard of the divine temple?

384
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,960
Any temple for worshipping is a divine temple.

385
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,590
When heaven was separated from earth, giant monsters ran wild.

386
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Master from the divine temple came
to earth with dignity and virtue,

387
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,550
teaching mankind characters and etiquette

388
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,400
and helping mankind cut mountains and make seas,

389
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,960
thus laying foundation for the human race.

390
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,840
How could you not know that?

391
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,350
The divine temple?

392
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,590
Isn't it imaginary

393
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,150
and nobody has ever been there?

394
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,670
I saw it.

395
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,080
Where?

396
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
In the north. The farthest north.

397
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,760
The north?

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,910
Do you know I have an elder brother?

399
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,200
Zhuang Mohan?

400
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,030
It turns out you knew it.

401
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,230
He's my brother,

402
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,790
so he's your granduncle

403
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,320
or great-uncle.

404
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,640
He spit blood because of me

405
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,110
in the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

406
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,080
I've heard of it.

407
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,000
We're a family. It doesn't matter.

408
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,350
Rising to fame at a young age,

409
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,080
he's a famous literator.

410
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,280
I didn't accomplish incredible things at that time.

411
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,960
I served as Head of Embroidered Uniform Guards,

412
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,030
but many people thought

413
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,520
I profited from association with him.

414
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,150
I was not convinced,

415
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,760
so I took my mother's surname.

416
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,640
That is, your great grandma's surname.

417
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,960
Enough. Stop talking about the relatives.

418
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,590
I've got so many elders

419
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,470
in a short time.

420
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,280
Fine. Let's get to the point.

421
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,760
I got a new surname

422
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,190
and decided to do something big.

423
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,230
At that time,

424
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
the late emperor focused on

425
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,280
immortality.

426
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,560
He spent lots of time and money on it

427
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,000
and finally got some clues

428
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,560
which indicated that

429
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,560
the divine temple is in the north.

430
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,590
The late emperor sent a group of over 1,000 people

431
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
=Young Xiao En=
to the north

432
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,830
for the divine temple.

433
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,400
It was me and Ku He that led the group.

434
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,540
=Young Ku He=

435
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,710
Ku He?

436
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
Even a Great Master was sent there.

437
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,710
At that time,

438
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,640
Ku He wasn't a Great Master yet.

439
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,190
The late emperor let him do it

440
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,800
because he's keen on the harmony between nature and mankind,

441
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,070
and yearned to go to the divine temple.

442
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,110
Besides,

443
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,760
he's a member of the royal family, anyway.

444
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,280
So, he could serve as a supervisor.

445
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,280
Is Ku He a member of the royal family?

446
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,040
Speaking of that,

447
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,040
the late emperor is his elder brother.

448
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,800
No wonder the current little emperor

449
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,680
and the Empress Dowager

450
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
trust him so much.

451
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,520
In this case,

452
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,160
Ku He is also qualified for the throne.

453
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,880
Well, Ku He

454
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,830
is hypocritical,

455
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,760
but he's indifferent to politics.

456
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,110
He's not interested

457
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,070
in the throne.

458
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,400
Please go ahead.

459
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,710
Did you keep going north

460
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,680
and then find the divine temple?

461
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,560
It wasn't that easy.

462
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,680
We kept going north

463
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,230
and went by Beilao Pass,

464
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,560
arriving somewhere no one has ever been.

465
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,310
The wild north snowed all year round.

466
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,040
What we saw every day and night

467
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,760
was snow-covered landscape.

468
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,470
Gradually, some people went blind

469
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,070
and some suffered from serious diseases.

470
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,190
Fewer and fewer people were left.

471
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,000
Accidents frequently happened on the dangerous snow land.

472
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,560
More and more of us fell behind,

473
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
ran away or just died.

474
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,070
Only a few hundred people left.

475
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,710
Still later,

476
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,950
we lost supplies and provisions.

477
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,470
Even horses were eaten.

478
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,430
At that time, we couldn't turn back.

479
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,590
We knew

480
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,040
it was impossible to go back.

481
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,160
Do you know what it feels like to be truly hungry?

482
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,800
No animals. No plants.

483
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,350
Everywhere was covered with snow.

484
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,350
You'd go crazy because of hunger.

485
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,710
Something was aroused deep in your heart

486
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,760
and it swallowed all your humanity,

487
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,950
etiquette and morality

488
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,710
little by little.

489
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,560
Then,

490
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,680
you became a beast.

491
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,070
Have you ever been in despair?

492
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,710
Good.

493
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,310
I hope you'd never

494
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,430
have a chance to experience that.

495
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,310
Finally, only Ku He and I

496
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,640
survived.

497
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,680
Actually, our stories

498
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,830
almost had a different ending.

499
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,880
Killing each other.

500
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,400
But at that time,

501
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,000
we found Heaven was angry.

502
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,920
Maybe the divine temple was enraged

503
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,760
after knowing that we common people

504
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,040
tried to find it.

505
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Maybe

506
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,640
it was a punishment

507
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,880
for what we had done.

508
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,040
The farther north we went, the longer the night was.

509
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,310
Then one day,

510
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,190
endless darkness

511
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,590
arrived.

512
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,110
It's called polar night.

513
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,310
Why?

514
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,310
Who named it?

515
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,310
I'm just saying.

516
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,560
Go on.

517
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,230
What happened when the polar night appeared?

518
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,560
Ku He prayed to Heaven,

519
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,800
so did I.

520
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,280
Later, we found green alga

521
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,920
under the snow.

522
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,880
It's bitter,

523
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,710
but it's non-poisonous.

524
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,190
We suffered all kinds of torments

525
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,430
in the darkness every day.

526
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,760
We didn't know how long had passed,

527
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,800
but we knew our lives would come to an end.

528
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,190
Just when we thought

529
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,640
we were dying,

530
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,640
the day

531
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,520
finally broke.

532
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,800
It was hope that Heaven gave us.

533
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,000
It made us hang in there

534
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,950
and survive.

535
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,640
You had lots of luck.

536
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,590
You even survived the polar night

537
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,470
that usually lasts several months.

538
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,430
Then,

539
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,830
we found the divine temple.

540
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,190
Where is it?

541
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,310
I don't know.

542
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,110
Didn't you find it?

543
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,160
It wasn't there at the beginning,

544
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,950
but it appeared suddenly.

545
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,710
I still don't understand

546
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,230
how it appeared.

547
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,040
I also don't know

548
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,470
what on earth the divine temple is.

549
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,400
Grey walls and a brown gate?

550
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,830
The temple in Beiqi

551
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,040
is the same color.

552
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,680
But the one in Nanqing is different.

553
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,310
Do you mean

554
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,350
Nanqing got it wrong as for colors

555
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,040
and Beiqi is correct?

556
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,400
No.

557
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,230
He said what we saw

558
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,280
was what we thought it was.

559
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,680
He? Do you mean Ku He?

560
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,470
No.

561
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,880
You just said

562
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
Ku He and you were the only survivors.

563
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,880
So, who is he?

564
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,310
No hurry. Let me explain.

565
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay. Go ahead.

566
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,190
You found the divine temple.

567
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,560
What did you see after you went in?

568
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,640
Went in?

569
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,470
We failed to go in.

570
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,000
But you just said

571
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,070
there was a brown gate.

572
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,280
There was a gate,

573
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,350
but

574
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,070
it's untouchable.

575
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,520
What do you mean by "untouchable"?

576
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,280
Do you mean the gate drew back automatically?

577
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,400
Not exactly.

578
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,400
Let me put it this way.

579
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,880
It's like the gate was there,

580
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,830
but it moved to another place

581
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,000
automatically

582
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,470
when I reached out my hand.

583
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,520
No matter how hard I forged ahead,

584
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,590
it always kept a short distance from me.

585
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,000
Only a very short distance,

586
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,230
but it's like a whole world.

587
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,190
I could never touch it.

588
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,800
Spatial warping?

589
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,470
Ku He said

590
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,640
it was because I was not sincere enough.

591
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,760
Then he prayed sincerely

592
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,710
before he reached out his hand.

593
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,710
Did it work?

594
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,560
He couldn't touch it either?

595
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,560
That's right,

596
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,070
but it was a different case

597
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,110
for him.

598
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,070
A hologram?

599
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,110
What?

600
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,800
A kind of optical and shadow illusion.

601
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
It looks real,

602
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,110
but it doesn't exist.

603
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,640
No.

604
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,470
It was not an illusion.

605
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,070
It was not an illusion.

606
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,880
How could it be like this?

607
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,350
We tried a lot of ways,

608
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,800
but we just couldn't touch the gate.

609
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,520
When I tried, it was untouchable.

610
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,110
When he tried, the divine temple disappeared.

611
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,230
How about climbing walls?

612
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,040
It was the same case.

613
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,710
The walls were untouchable too.

614
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,190
Ku He said

615
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,640
it was our destiny.

616
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,640
And then? Did you go back?

617
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,160
What's the point of keeping it a secret?

618
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,710
Then the gate opened.

619
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,950
Wasn't it untouchable?

620
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Yes, it was.

621
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,190
How did you push it open?

622
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,800
It was opened from the inside.

623
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,430
Someone opened it from the inside?

624
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,280
That's why I said

625
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
my secret is about a place

626
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,000
and a person.

627
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,800
The place is the divine temple.

628
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,830
And the person

629
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,760
is the fairy from the temple.

630
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,190
A woman.

631
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,640
Later, she came to the human world.

632
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,800
Her name is

633
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,280
Ye Qingmei.

634
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,310
I wonder if you've heard of it.

635
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,880
I…

636
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,000
Her name is Ye Qingmei.

637
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,350
Ye Qingmei?

638
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,470
It means "looking down upon all men".

639
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,070
She was bound to no rules of the world.

640
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,710
She could always

641
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,230
make unexpected moves.

642
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,590
Do you know who once lived in this yard?

643
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,350
I've no idea.

644
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,430
It was an old friend of mine.

645
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,710
At that time, she just stood there.

646
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,710
I asked her

647
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,710
what flowers she wanted to plant

648
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,000
when the Investigator's Office was just set up.

649
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,640
I'd find them no matter how precious they are

650
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,760
as long as she told me.

651
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,880
Your mother actually was

652
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,590
unparalleled in the world.

653
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,040
What's so magical about my mom?

654
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,000
She's the guider

655
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,000
and the betrayer.

656
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,350
She's like Nuwa who repaired the heaven.

657
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,920
She's the cause of every phenomenon on earth.

658
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,350
She's the end of finality.

659
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,880
Hi, my son.

660
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,800
You didn't misread it.

661
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,680
This letter is for you.

662
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,000
Of course I've heard of it.

663
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,880
What's more,

664
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,640
she's my mom.

665
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,710
That was the first time I met her.

666
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,760
=Ye Qingmei=
Hi people, nice to meet you.

667
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,920
It's a nice day.

668
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,680
Anything wrong?

669
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,430
I've got changed

670
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,470
and dressed up

671
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,710
as people in this era do.

672
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,920
Can you tell me

673
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,190
if you're stupid?

674
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,230
She was straightforward.

675
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,800
It also took us some time

676
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,000
to respond.

677
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,880
Seeing a fairy come out of

678
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,160
the divine temple,

679
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,470
Ku He knelt and kowtowed at once.

680
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,560
But I hesitated.

681
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,400
What's the point of kneeling?

682
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,590
That's how he became

683
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,040
a Grand Master.

684
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,110
It's my mom…

685
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,880
Are the two things related?

686
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
May I have your name?

687
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
We don't know each other.

688
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,520
Why are you kowtowing to me?

689
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,830
It's dangerous here.

690
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,070
Let's get out of here.

691
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,310
Come on.

692
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,000
If you keep doing it,

693
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,590
you'd suffer from cerebral concussion.

694
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,310
I think your physique is suitable for it.

695
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,070
Hold on.

696
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,350
Here you are.

697
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,350
I've made it

698
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,280
written in a way

699
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,230
you're used to.

700
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,590
Just read and follow it.

701
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,280
Secret techniques?

702
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,070
In a sense,

703
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,920
it is.

704
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,880
You can read it too.

705
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,470
But he's more suitable.

706
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,590
Alright.

707
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I must go.

708
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,560
Or they'll catch up with me.

709
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,680
Dangerous?

710
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,880
What's dangerous?

711
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
She said there was something

712
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,520
that didn't want her to leave.

713
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,560
Someone was stopping it

714
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,950
from pursuing her inside.

715
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,000
So, she asked us to

716
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,920
take her out of the snow land ASAP.

717
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,640
Where did you go?

718
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,230
Did you take her to Beiqi?

719
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,680
Yeah.

720
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,190
How about that book?

721
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,110
I studied it with Ku He.

722
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,470
As she predicted,

723
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,520
Ku He made faster progress than me

724
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,800
no matter how hard I practiced.

725
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,390
Did you go straight back to Beiqi?

726
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,430
No.

727
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,670
She asked us a lot on the way.

728
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,150
When we were about to arrive at Beilao Pass,

729
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,670
she parted with us.

730
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,800
Parted? Why?

731
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,910
I want to play too.

732
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,230
You want to play?

733
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,150
Here you are.

734
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,600
You'd better go back.

735
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,520
How about you?

736
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,360
Something is chasing my friend.

737
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,470
I have to help him.

738
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,600
I'm willing to give a hand.

739
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,670
No way.

740
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,910
Based on your current capacities,

741
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,280
the survival rate is less than 10%.

742
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,670
It means you'll die.

743
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,230
Don't worry.

744
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,280
Just go back.

745
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,470
I'll be fine.

746
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,280
Ku He treated her words

747
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
like an imperial edict.

748
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,560
No.

749
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,520
He showed more respect to her words.

750
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,390
So, he listened to her and left.

751
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,360
How about you?

752
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,840
I was interested in that book,

753
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,910
so I followed him.

754
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,470
Besides,

755
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,630
people from the divine temple don't like to be bothered.

756
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,520
I have the wisdom to know myself.

757
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,150
I didn't dare to step in.

758
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,600
That's an interesting story,

759
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,390
but I still don't understand

760
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,910
why you have to keep it a secret.

761
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,190
She asked us to do that.

762
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,950
I hope you can do me a favor.

763
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,840
Please stand up.

764
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,600
It's too much for me.

765
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,280
Got it.

766
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,760
It's just

767
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,040
I hope you can keep it a secret.

768
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,230
Don't tell anyone where the divine temple is

769
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,950
and don't tell anyone you met me there.

770
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,120
Please keep everything about the divine temple

771
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,120
to yourself.

772
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,910
Don't let anyone else know about it.

773
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,910
Got it.

774
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,520
Why?

775
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,910
Do you know

776
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,320
what the divine temple looks like?

777
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,600
I saw it.

778
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,430
It has black walls and grey eaves.

779
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,320
Actually it doesn't.

780
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,360
That's what you think it is.

781
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,230
What you saw

782
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,840
was what you thought it was.

783
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,470
Some people think

784
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,000
the divine temple should be glittering.

785
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,080
So, they'll see

786
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,080
a golden house.

787
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,560
Does the divine temple change

788
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
as people wish?

789
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,280
You can say that.

790
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,360
It's true that

791
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,080
it can read what's on people's mind.

792
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,560
In this case,

793
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,520
the divine temple is a living being.

794
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,120
You can also say that.

795
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,000
Is it really a living being?

796
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,670
Very close, but not exactly.

797
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,390
Let me put it this way.

798
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,760
Something bad is imprisoned

799
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,950
under the divine temple.

800
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,040
The more people find it,

801
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,800
the more likely it is

802
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,840
to get out.

803
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,190
Once it runs away,

804
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,040
it'll be the end of the world.

805
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,150
So, for the sake of all living creatures,

806
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,760
I hope

807
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,150
you can keep it a secret.

808
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,870
I'd do that

809
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,800
even if I have to die.

810
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,430
I'll do all I can

811
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
to stop anyone else from finding the divine temple.

812
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,520
Thank you.

813
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,430
I'm leaving for my friend.

814
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
As for that book,

815
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,150
you can't take it

816
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,320
without sharing with me.

817
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,600
Your Excellency,

818
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,120
please keep everything about the divine temple to yourself.

819
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,470
If I find out

820
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,560
you spill the beans,

821
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,760
I'll kill you.

822
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,230
Since then,

823
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,150
I've never seen Ye Qingmei again.

824
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,360
As expected,

825
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,390
mom came from the divine temple.

826
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,040
Her friend

827
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,470
must be Uncle Wuzhu.

828
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,230
But who was chasing them?

829
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,120
Or what was chasing them?

830
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
What secret on earth was it

831
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,520
under the divine temple?

832
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,840
It can change its appearance as people wish.

833
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,040
Is it mind reading?

834
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,870
What's on your mind?

835
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,230
Nothing.

836
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,230
I'm quite shocked.

837
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,470
So, you've been keeping it

838
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,600
to yourself?

839
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,430
I promised.

840
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,470
I seldom broke my promise.

841
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,710
But you told me.

842
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,320
Because I think

843
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,800
Chen Pingping is overenthusiastic

844
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,800
about the divine temple

845
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,840
and Ye Qingmei.

846
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,670
Now that you know the secret,

847
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,150
Chen Pingping wouldn't kill you

848
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,430
and you may even take control of him.

849
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,670
It's also why

850
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,000
Ku He wants to kill you.

851
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,560
After being imprisoned for years,

852
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,320
I was finally set free.

853
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,000
He thinks that I may stage a comeback

854
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,190
by use of the secret.

855
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,870
It's about the divine temple anyway.

856
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,470
All beliefs in the world

857
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,950
are about the holy place.

858
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Will you do that?

859
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,280
Who knows?

860
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,230
What happened later?

861
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,430
When did Ku He

862
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,280
become a Grand Master?

863
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,910
Maybe two or three years later after that.

864
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,000
He left me in dust

865
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,870
before long

866
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,390
just because of the book

867
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,870
he got at the divine temple.

868
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,840
How about Ye Qingmei?

869
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,040
Where did she go?

870
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,710
I heard she traveled around the world,

871
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,870
with a blind servant.

872
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,190
She went to Dongyi Town

873
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,000
and met Si Gujian.

874
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,560
Then she went to Nanqing

875
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,840
and met Ye Liuyun.

876
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,910
She met three of the Four Great Masters.

877
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,190
During the ten years,

878
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,870
she stayed in Nanqing,

879
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,630
establishing firms

880
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,000
and making lots of amazing stuff.

881
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,710
She even became the richest person in the world.

882
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,360
Everyone was shocked,

883
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,280
but I was not surprised at all.

884
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,950
She came from the divine temple.

885
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,000
It's normal no matter how unbelievable

886
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,360
things were.

887
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,190
Yeah.

888
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,470
She was just a legend.

889
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,950
But I didn't expect

890
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,630
such a fairy

891
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,320
would fall in love with a mortal

892
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,840
and finally marry into the royal family of Nanqing.

893
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,320
Nanqing is astonishingly lucky.

894
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,190
It's a pity that Beiqi has no luck.

895
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,040
What did you say?

896
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,560
Do you mean…

897
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,190
What's up?

898
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,230
Do you mean Ye Qingmei

899
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,600
married into the royal family of Nanqing?

900
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,150
Yeah.

901
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,840
Did you get it wrong?

902
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,360
Few guys

903
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,800
know about it in the world.

904
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,470
But I was Head of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

905
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,520
They couldn't hide it from me.

906
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,000
Who did she marry?

907
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,950
He was a prince at that time.

908
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Now,

909
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,280
he's the emperor of Nanqing.

910
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,190
Did she marry Emperor Qing?

911
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,390
Exactly.

912
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,360
They didn't hold a wedding ceremony,

913
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,560
but they were actually a couple.

914
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,630
Ye Qingmei was also pregnant

915
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,800
with his baby.

916
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,870
That's the last thing

917
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,120
I knew about her.

918
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,320
After that,

919
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,760
Chen Pingping traveled thousands of miles

920
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,840
to catch me and take me to Nanqing.

921
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,950
After being imprisoned in the Investigator's Office,

922
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,950
I knew nothing more about her.

923
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,040
I heard she died.

924
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,600
Her kid's father

925
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,600
is Emperor Qing?

926
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
That's right.

927
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,800
I think he's at your age.

928
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,470
I'd been imprisoned for so long,

929
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,000
so I don't know too much about the royal family of Nanqing.

930
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,190
I'm not sure

931
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,840
which prince is that kid

932
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,630
or if there is something special about him.

933
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,910
The capital city is not a good place.

934
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,120
The late emperor died there.

935
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,000
Your mom died there.

936
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,710
You can live longer if you stay in Danzhou.

937
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,780
In the river of history,

938
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,980
time goes round and round.

939
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,340
Memories about the former and present lives

940
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,220
join each other in an endless way.

941
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,820
In the long drunken Milky Way,

942
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,540
one season follows another in a flash,

943
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,740
and the wild geese are flying south.

944
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,660
I just can't give up

945
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,660
to be with you for my whole life.

946
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,940
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

947
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

948
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,620
Year after year in the wandering,

949
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,180
I count the remaining years.

950
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,380
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

951
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,940
even though we have ended up the destiny,

952
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,620
I never feel regretful.

953
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,580
In such a chaotic world,

954
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,340
I still miss you as ever.

955
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,980
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

956
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,700
With a gentle heart,

957
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,260
I cherish our remaining years.

958
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,100
Even though we have to go through

959
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,060
all the hardships along the journey,

960
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:27,380
you always stay by my side,

961
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,140
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

962
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,060
Year after year in the wandering,

963
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,420
I count the remaining years.

964
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,780
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

965
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,580
even though we end up the destiny,

966
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,020
I never feel regretful.

967
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,940
In such a chaotic world,

968
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,900
I still miss you as ever.

969
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,580
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

970
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,340
With a gentle heart,

971
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,740
I cherish our remaining years.

972
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,540
Even though we have to go through

973
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,700
all the hardships along the journey,

974
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:07,980
you always stay by my side...
