00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:20,019
(Episode 46)

5
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:22,641
- My gosh. - Be careful.

6
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,352
Are you all right?

7
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:28,281
Give me a glass of water.

8
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:29,481
I'll get it for you.

9
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:34,622
By the way, why did Si Woo do such a thing?

10
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:38,232
Why call off his engagement and go to Jin Ah's dad's funeral?

11
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,562
I just don't understand.

12
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:48,401
Si Woo went to the funeral?

13
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:50,842
Who said that?

14
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:53,242
Jin Ah's mom told me.

15
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:56,581
She bragged that Director Choi,

16
00:00:56,882 --> 00:01:00,622
the future successor of Hyunkang, came and acted like family.

17
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,492
- Ms. Choi. - Be careful.

18
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:05,821
What is it, Ms. Choi?

19
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:07,261
- What is it? - Have a seat here.

20
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,662
Where is Nam Jin right now?

21
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,731
Nam Jin is at work.

22
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,451
Nam Jin, this is Si Woo's mom.

23
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:38,222
Why did you lie?

24
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:44,061
Why did you lie that Si Woo wasn't at the funeral?

25
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:47,132
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:52,272
Did you think you could take over Hyunkang...

27
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:55,201
if you put Si Woo and Jin Ah together?

28
00:01:58,112 --> 00:01:59,612
Genes don't lie.

29
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,912
You're just like your birth mother.

30
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,311
You pretend to be nice,

31
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:08,682
but scheme behind people's backs.

32
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:11,021
What is with you, Ms. Choi?

33
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:13,222
Why are you taking it out on Nam Jin?

34
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,092
This won't go as you planned.

35
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:20,962
So stop pulling shallow tricks.

36
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:35,741
Si Woo.

37
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,682
See me in my room.

38
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:55,331
What is it? Who was that?

39
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:58,671
It was Ms. Choi.

40
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:01,201
What did she say?

41
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:05,741
Is it because you lied about Si Woo not being at the funeral?

42
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:10,412
My mom told me I'd be punished if I lied and it's true.

43
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:13,182
How could you be joking right now?

44
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:17,321
I protected Jin Ah's love.

45
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:19,092
That's all that matters.

46
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:23,891
You're a fool.

47
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:30,331
Where were you?

48
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,171
I'm sorry, Mom.

49
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:43,111
Do you think you can solve this with an apology?

50
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:47,852
I love Jin Ah.

51
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,481
I can't accept her for anything.

52
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,291
If you don't like So Jeong,

53
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,391
let's look for someone else.

54
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:00,701
No, don't do that.

55
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,331
Jung Jin Ah is the woman I want to marry.

56
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:09,972
Love?

57
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,541
Do you think that will last forever?

58
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,352
You once asked...

59
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,991
what it felt like to be the secret mistress.

60
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,791
It was okay back then...

61
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,032
because I loved your father.

62
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:37,972
And I had you.

63
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:40,171
I said it was okay,

64
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,311
but it wasn't.

65
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:47,941
Your dad...

66
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,782
abandoned his love like an old pair of shoes...

67
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:55,722
and I was cold and alone.

68
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:57,421
Love?

69
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,291
There's no such thing as love.

70
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,662
It all changes over time.

71
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:10,902
That might have been true for Dad, but not me.

72
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:15,402
I can't give up on Jin Ah.

73
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,152
There's nothing I can do if you won't give up.

74
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:32,621
Mom.

75
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:39,532
If you don't give up on her, I'll die.

76
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,061
This won't change anything.

77
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:46,631
I'll do my best to become the successor of Hyunkang.

78
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:49,171
And I won't...

79
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,572
give up on Jin Ah.

80
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:53,671
How could you treat me like this?

81
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:56,681
Do you think I'd leave her alone?

82
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:59,551
If you lay a finger on Jin Ah,

83
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:02,082
I'm going to leave.

84
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:04,191
What?

85
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,051
You'd abandon your mother...

86
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:09,421
for someone...

87
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:12,431
like her?

88
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,361
You're my past...

89
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,131
and she's my future.

90
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,171
I'll leave you to rest.

91
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,892
Do you have something to say to me?

92
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,791
How could you say such a harsh thing?

93
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:19,832
This is a matter between me and my mom.

94
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,731
I don't think it's any of your business.

95
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:24,931
Ms. Choi collapsed.

96
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,671
She even drank alcohol.

97
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,441
She drank alcohol?

98
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:36,342
Don't you know what that means?

99
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:39,611
It means what you did distressed her more than she can handle!

100
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:47,522
You know what her life has been like.

101
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:52,231
You know that she went through such hardship for a time...

102
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:54,202
to help you inherit Hyunkang!

103
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,202
How could you say such a thing knowing all that?

104
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,301
You will abandon your mother because of a girl?

105
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:01,671
What did you say?

106
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:05,311
Your mother is the past and Ms. Jung is your future?

107
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,472
That's enough.

108
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:09,412
There's no reason...

109
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,611
I should hear this from you.

110
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:14,181
No. I'm going to say what I have to say.

111
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,322
I can't see Ms. Choi in agony like that anymore.

112
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:22,262
Don't disappoint her anymore, Si Woo.

113
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:26,662
My mom is not that weak.

114
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:29,402
She will eventually accept it.

115
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,832
Please leave now.

116
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:45,781
My goodness.

117
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:48,722
What on earth is going on?

118
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:52,222
Are Si Woo and Jin Ah really dating?

119
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:56,261
Why else would my angel be that upset?

120
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:59,891
Oh, dear. I'm worried about Nam Jin.

121
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:02,861
He will be really sad if he finds out about this.

122
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:05,231
I think Nam Jin knows it too.

123
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,871
That's probably why he lied...

124
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:09,802
that Si Woo didn't go to the funeral.

125
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,572
That makes sense.

126
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:16,942
But why did he lie for Si Woo when Si Woo is dating...

127
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,781
the woman he likes?

128
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:23,722
Maybe he found out that Jin Ah loves Si Woo,

129
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,922
so he let her go even though it broke his heart.

130
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,861
Right. That makes sense.

131
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:32,332
It's possible if you think about Nam Jin's personality.

132
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,602
Anyway,

133
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,531
Jin Ah that wench is evil.

134
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:41,741
How could she start dating another man soon after leaving Nam Jin?

135
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:42,871
And out of everyone,

136
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,741
she picked Nam Jin's half-brother.

137
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,312
That's exactly my point.

138
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:49,381
It's a good thing for Nam Jin.

139
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:52,911
But Nam Jin must be very upset.

140
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:55,682
I'm sure he'll overcome it.

141
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,021
You know how strong and manly Nam Jin is.

142
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:04,222
Listen. Let's take good care of Ms. Choi...

143
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:05,962
for the time being.

144
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,592
How can we?

145
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:10,131
She always gives us the cold shoulder.

146
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:13,832
What if she attempts suicide by drug overdose?

147
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:17,972
If you're worried about her that much,

148
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:20,712
why don't you stand guard in front of her room?

149
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:22,812
I mean, you call her your angel.

150
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,182
Standing guard?

151
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:28,021
Right. I didn't think of that. Good.

152
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,462
Let's leave now.

153
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:39,562
So soon?

154
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,361
Let's wait for just another hour.

155
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:45,371
You said that several times already.

156
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:51,472
Fine. Then I'll go buy some coffee.

157
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:03,722
I... I'll be back shortly.

158
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:07,521
Seung Joo, where are you going?

159
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:11,021
Gosh.

160
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,731
Excuse me.

161
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:15,962
Hello. How are you?

162
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,932
- May I ask you a question? - Of course, ma'am.

163
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,442
Where did you get this stuffed dolphin?

164
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:25,842
I picked it up in the hallway.

165
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:28,542
On which floor did you find it?

166
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:30,381
On the 16th floor.

167
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:35,151
I know the owner of this stuffed dolphin well.

168
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:38,021
Do you mind if I take this to her?

169
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:44,261
I bought this for my niece at SeaWorld.

170
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:46,891
My niece's name is Soo Ji.

171
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:49,702
Look. Her name is written here. Han Soo Ji.

172
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:53,672
I see. Then go ahead.

173
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,141
Okay. Thank you.

174
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:08,151
Wait.

175
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:10,222
What are you going to do?

176
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,352
I don't have any plan.

177
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:15,822
Shall we knock on every door?

178
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:20,092
Do you think she will welcome us if we just knock on her door?

179
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:24,472
Well... How about I blow this whistle?

180
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,472
Gosh, no. Why would you think of doing that?

181
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:29,871
We might get kicked out of the hotel.

182
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:34,271
Then shall we say that we'll replace room supplies?

183
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:37,241
Okay. Room supplies. That's a good idea.

184
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:40,182
Wait. What kind of room supplies?

185
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,422
Let's just take toilet paper out of the room.

186
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:48,922
No. Let's just knock every door.

187
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,661
No. We'll get ourselves into trouble.

188
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,131
If someone will be in trouble or get slapped in the face,

189
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:57,462
I'll be the one. So you just stay behind me.

190
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,501
Let's go.

191
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:01,401
- Let's go. - Something's wrong with him.

192
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:09,381
- We really shouldn't do it. - Just trust me.

193
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,151
Oh, no.

194
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:17,852
My goodness.

195
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,072
Mi Ra.

196
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,322
Oh, my. Seung Joo. What's going on?

197
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:49,751
What are you doing here?

198
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:16,111
Here you go. It's yours, Soo Ji.

199
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,411
Soo Ji, she's Seung Joo. Don't you remember her?

200
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,121
Can you really not remember me?

201
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:31,121
I read you a lot of books when your mom was busy.

202
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:34,231
I'm also the person who bought you this stuffed dolphin.

203
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,871
Now, you remember me.

204
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:49,141
I was flustered because she lost her stuffed dolphin.

205
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:50,241
Thank you.

206
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:53,481
By the way, why did you come here? Are you here to see me?

207
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,281
But how did you know that I was here?

208
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,891
Well, actually...

209
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,722
I came here to ask you a favor.

210
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,731
A favor? What is it?

211
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,062
Who is he?

212
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,722
What are you doing here?

213
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:36,792
I was afraid you might think of harming yourself...

214
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:40,391
while I was sleeping, so I was standing guard here.

215
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:45,131
Did you think I would overdose on pills?

216
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,602
Yes.

217
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,911
That won't happen. Go to your room and get some sleep.

218
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:54,442
Are you serious? Are you sure?

219
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,682
I will not die...

220
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:02,422
until I see Si Woo inherit Hyunkang.

221
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:04,991
So don't worry.

222
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:11,661
Well...

223
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,462
Try not to focus solely on your child.

224
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:21,001
I mean, it's not like Si Woo will live your life for you.

225
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:26,241
You'll only stimulate him by disapproving of what he does.

226
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:29,182
It's better to take a step back...

227
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,741
and keep an eye on him.

228
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,781
I can see him walking into a fire.

229
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,852
How am I supposed to just sit back and watch?

230
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,521
What if they quit everything...

231
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:43,621
and leave to a different country because of your disapproval?

232
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:47,391
Si Woo seems like he's capable of doing that.

233
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:52,031
I know what I'm doing.

234
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:02,381
You want me to be the model for a contest at Hyunkang?

235
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,012
Yes, please Mi Ra.

236
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,381
I understand the situation you're in,

237
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:12,451
but I don't want to pick up my career again.

238
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,651
Why not?

239
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,191
You were Korea's top celebrity.

240
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:21,131
Don't you know many people are still waiting for you to return?

241
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,032
I miss those days too,

242
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:28,371
but now I can't go back.

243
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:32,512
It'll be painful for everyone if I do.

244
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,621
Is it because of Soo Ji?

245
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,082
Yes.

246
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,721
Then why did you return to Korea?

247
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:57,002
It's okay, he may look immature...

248
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:59,701
and lame, but he can keep a secret.

249
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:07,671
Until two years ago, Soo Ji's dad would visit the US...

250
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,681
to see her, even if it were only for a short while.

251
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:13,052
However, I haven't heard from him since last year.

252
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:16,621
I see.

253
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:20,691
You know Soo Ji has autism.

254
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:24,121
She whined about missing her dad...

255
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,832
and one day, she started hurting herself.

256
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,901
I couldn't take it and took her to a hospital.

257
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,401
The doctor says she has depression.

258
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:34,772
Oh, no.

259
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,602
- Depression? - Yes.

260
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:41,711
It's hard to cure it in children...

261
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:45,082
and the doctor said Soo Ji might get better...

262
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,411
if she meets the person she misses.

263
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,151
I actually came to Korea to meet Soo Ji's dad.

264
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:56,822
Was the man we saw earlier Soo Ji's dad?

265
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:58,891
Did you see him?

266
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,232
Yes.

267
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:08,502
You could explain Soo Ji's condition...

268
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:11,842
to her father and meet him without feeling guilty.

269
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,141
He...

270
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,542
has a wife.

271
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,852
He's someone everyone knows by name.

272
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,522
No wonder he looked familiar.

273
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:33,232
Then what are you going to do?

274
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:37,032
He said...

275
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,631
he won't come to see me or Soo Ji anymore.

276
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:43,371
I don't know what to do.

277
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:45,871
She's gotten so much better...

278
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:48,482
right after seeing him.

279
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:56,681
I hope she'll get to meet him...

280
00:19:56,921 --> 00:19:58,992
until she gets better.

281
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,522
I hope so too.

282
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:05,732
I'm planning to open a flower shop...

283
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,661
and stay near him until Soo Ji gets better.

284
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:22,911
Come in.

285
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:25,512
Hi, come here and have a seat.

286
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:29,482
What brings you here this early in the morning?

287
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:32,721
I came to give you this.

288
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:34,822
What is this?

289
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:38,191
The 100 thousand dollars you lent me.

290
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,361
I don't need it anymore.

291
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,802
What do you mean?

292
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:46,072
Jin Ah didn't get a private loan,

293
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:48,542
but Si Woo paid it back for her.

294
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:50,802
Si Woo did?

295
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:55,582
Did Jung Jin Ah have anything to do...

296
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,911
with him calling off his engagement?

297
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:03,282
How did you know?

298
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:07,352
You have a sharp instinct.

299
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:09,721
Yes, I do.

300
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,332
Are you okay, Nam Jin?

301
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,002
I was very upset at first,

302
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:20,701
but then I remembered something Grandpa said.

303
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,641
What did he say?

304
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,272
He said you're not meant to be...

305
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,242
if it doesn't work out even when you tried your best.

306
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:33,282
He once told me the same thing...

307
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,582
when I was younger.

308
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:37,522
Then...

309
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:40,322
have you had your heart broken as well?

310
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:45,762
You could say that.

311
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:52,602
Anyway, I think this is as far as my love goes.

312
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:55,171
- That's good. - 5,000?

313
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:56,342
- Yes. - Yes.

314
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,542
- You don't have to worry. - Yes.

315
00:21:59,072 --> 00:22:00,641
Yes, yes.

316
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,582
Even people in rural areas must have heard about it.

317
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:05,651
This is awesome.

318
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:07,711
How is the other team doing in sales?

319
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:12,022
I visited their website and many people complained...

320
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:14,522
that it's too expensive, it looks like a doll's outfit,

321
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:17,292
and that it rips easily.

322
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:22,032
I got three orders today.

323
00:22:23,262 --> 00:22:24,832
Life is worth living.

324
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:27,032
I'm starting to lose my voice.

325
00:22:27,232 --> 00:22:30,072
I heard the other team is giving a lot of refunds.

326
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:34,312
50 percent of the sales will be applied,

327
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,881
so that means we're practically tied.

328
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,752
- That's great. - Nice.

329
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:42,082
Nice.

330
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,492
- Is Ms. Choi at work? - Yes.

331
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,661
Didn't you come together?

332
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:54,391
No, we came separately today.

333
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:56,461
You can go in.

334
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:58,332
Okay.

335
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:04,971
What's this?

336
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:07,242
How dare you come in my office!

337
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:09,482
Let's talk, Mom.

338
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:16,582
What's with those two? They're always so loving.

339
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,421
Maybe they had a fight.

340
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:23,062
Now we won't be able open a store at Juseong Shopping Center.

341
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:25,161
Neither will we be getting an investment.

342
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,532
Are you happy now?

343
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:31,762
Look,

344
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:35,201
I'll become the successor of Hyunkang with what I have.

345
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:39,211
So trust me and watch me do it.

346
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:44,282
Don't think Nam Jin is a pushover.

347
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:48,552
You barely beat him in the first contest.

348
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:53,121
If the people on my side voted for them,

349
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,891
don't you see what that means?

350
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:58,292
I know. That's what motivated me further.

351
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:00,431
I'm going to try hard.

352
00:24:01,391 --> 00:24:02,461
So,

353
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:06,971
please let me have what I want just this once.

354
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:12,342
Are you asking me to approve of her?

355
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,812
That will never happen.

356
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:18,042
Even if you can't approve of her right now,

357
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:20,151
don't hurt her.

358
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:22,651
If you hurt her one more time...

359
00:24:23,282 --> 00:24:25,492
by calling her junk food,

360
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:29,562
you won't ever see me again.

361
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,262
What if they quit everything...

362
00:24:36,262 --> 00:24:39,931
and leave to a different country because of your disapproval?

363
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:42,602
Si Woo seems like he's capable of doing that.

364
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:46,411
Are you...

365
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:49,211
threatening me?

366
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:50,681
It isn't a threat.

367
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:52,752
I'm saying...

368
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:57,951
I won't let Jin Ah live in darkness her whole life like you did.

369
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:00,992
Are you saying...

370
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:04,691
you're going to marry her?

371
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:08,131
When I become the successor of Hyunkang,

372
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,302
I'm going to propose to her.

373
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:18,371
Please give us your blessing.

374
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:20,911
Does that mean...

375
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:23,941
that it doesn't matter...

376
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,982
whether I disapprove of her or not?

377
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:30,282
Yes.

378
00:25:44,532 --> 00:25:48,201
Why in the world did Mr. Choi call off the engagement?

379
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:52,441
Curiosity was killing me the entire weekend.

380
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:55,381
Don't you know anything, Yeon Ji?

381
00:25:56,411 --> 00:26:00,181
I don't know. Maybe he was bewitched by someone.

382
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:02,451
What is she saying?

383
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:05,992
I have a pile of work to do because he called it off.

384
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,651
Why?

385
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:11,221
We can't open a store at Juseong Shopping Center.

386
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,861
I have to rewrite the sales forecast report.

387
00:26:14,262 --> 00:26:16,631
One snake is ruining the lives of several people.

388
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,171
Your coffee is here.

389
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:22,871
Hello.

390
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:26,141
Jin Ah, these are the coffee and sandwiches you ordered.

391
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:27,742
What's this?

392
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:32,012
I ordered it to thank everyone...

393
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:34,181
for your thoughtfulness during my father's funeral.

394
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:38,052
I skipped breakfast. This is really nice.

395
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,121
- Yeon Ji, here you go. - I'm good.

396
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:43,292
Why?

397
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:47,391
I put two slices of ham only in your sandwich.

398
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:49,931
Really?

399
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:55,131
Then shall I eat it since you made it for me?

400
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:59,171
Finish your food quickly and get back to work.

401
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:01,072
Ms. Jung.

402
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:06,282
Have you done with the customer survey on our clothes?

403
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:09,322
I can finish it before the lunch break.

404
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:13,322
Hey... Jin Ah. I'll get going.

405
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:17,062
Yeon Ji, stop by my cafe later.

406
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,131
Come and taste the new menu that I developed.

407
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:21,961
Okay.

408
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:31,441
Let's start the meeting.

409
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:45,921
Okay.

410
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:49,721
Gosh.

411
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:11,242
(Seoul Correctional Facility)

412
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:14,151
Hi. My goodness. You've been through a lot.

413
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,421
- You must be cold. - Honey.

414
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:16,921
Eat some tofu.

415
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:20,151
- It must've been so hard. - Shall we go?

416
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:44,211
(Happy Adjustment Happy Citizens)

417
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:11,357
(It's My Life)

418
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,857
I'd like to take Soo Ji to an aquarium today.

419
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:17,097
She has never left home without me, her mom. Will you be okay?

420
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:19,026
She might behave in unusual ways.

421
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:21,926
Don't you want to get compensation from her?

422
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,696
- Compensation? - You can buy a new handbag.

423
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:25,436
Oh, right. You can get yourself a fur coat too.

424
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:26,766
Ms. Seo, help me out.

425
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,407
What should I do?

426
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:29,736
It's time.

427
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,536
Shall I make a move now?
