1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 36

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,080
Are you really the Saintess?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,120
Doesn't the Saintess wipe her hands?

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,630
What a temper!

19
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,510
Tell me.

20
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,000
How on earth

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,270
can you help me kill Xiao En?

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,000
I really can't help you do that.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,830
The mission and the cavalry are both around.

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,680
If I let you kill Xiao En,

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm sure to lose my job.

26
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,950
You can come to Beiqi instead.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,240
It's too cold. I'm not used to the weather.

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,080
I can assassinate him at the worst.

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,520
I'll guard him myself.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,030
Plus the cavalry,

31
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,800
feel free to have a try.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,190
I can hold you hostage.

33
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm just a little envoy.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,630
Nobody cares about my life.

35
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,390
We can join hands.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,630
Why?

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,190
To help you of course.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Help me what?

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,800
To help you and the Empress Dowager

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,110
take over power from

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,830
your little emperor.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
Nonsense!

43
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,750
Who told you I'm with the Empress Dowager.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,830
Your teacher Ku He is the Imperial Tutor.

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,080
She certainly has to take side.

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,160
As to the political fights of Beiqi,

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,390
there are mainly three forces.

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,160
One is led by the little emperor.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,910
One is led by the Empress Dowager.

50
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,600
And the other is led by Shangshan Hu,

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,630
which remains neutral.

52
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,080
Shangshan Hu wants to save Xiao En,

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
while you want to kill him.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,550
You're certainly not on the same side.

55
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,360
I could also be a follower of His Majesty.

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
The little emperor made it clear that

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,270
he wants Si Lili back.

58
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,360
If you kill Xiao En in Nanqing,

59
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,830
the mission will have to go back.

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,630
Then Si Lili won't be sent to Beiqi.

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,800
So you can't be a follower of

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,830
the little emperor.

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,470
In this case,

64
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,160
you can only be with the Empress Dowager.

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
Even if you guessed right,

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,630
how can you help me?

67
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,830
I'm the envoy of Nanqing after all.

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,080
The two of us joining hands together

69
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,110
is beyond all expectations.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,470
By doing so, we'll have everything to gain

71
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,440
and nothing to lose.

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,600
You actually know you're from Nanqing.

73
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,880
Yet you want to interfere with political affairs of Beiqi.

74
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,440
I just have a feeling that

75
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,240
it'll be extremely difficult

76
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,360
for me to bring Yan Bingyun back.

77
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,520
We're kind of helping each other out.

78
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,910
You've eaten my fruit after all.

79
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,830
Last night the rain was light, the wind was fierce,

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,830
and deep sleep did not dispel the effects of wine.

81
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,550
When I ask the maid rolling up the curtains,

82
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,230
she answers, "The crabapple blossoms look the same."

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,390
I cry, "Can't you see? Can't you see?

84
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,200
The green leaves are fresh but the red flowers are fading!"
('crabapple' has the same meaning as 'Haitang' in Chinese)

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,070
It's for you.

86
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,760
It's kind of celebrating our cooperation.

87
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,510
Poetic Genius Fan.

88
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,320
What do you think?

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,110
The crabapple blossoms can't be exposed to the rain.

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,160
Caught in wind and rain, the pot will gather water.

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
The crabapple blossoms will rot

92
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,200
instead of fading.

93
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,390
I'll take that as a "Yes".

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards,

95
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,270
will receive the mission in person.

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,720
Watch out yourself!

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,070
What's his character?

98
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,640
Does he have any weakness?

99
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,270
Before reaching Shangjing,

100
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,110
I won't give up on killing Xiao En.

101
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,600
Let's go.

102
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,270
Your Excellency, congratulations!

103
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,270
For what?

104
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,670
Do you have a thing for the Saintess?

105
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,440
Your Excellency, don't worry.

106
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,200
We won't tell Princess Lin

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
about this.

108
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Gao, how come you're also

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,230
making fun of me?

110
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,830
Thanks for Wang's detailed explanation,

111
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,270
I've known Your Excellency well.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,880
Your Excellency! Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

113
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,550
Your Excellency!

114
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,830
How are your wounds?

115
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,670
Do you feel better?

116
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,480
You and Duoduo...

117
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,160
Don't listen to Wang Qinian.

118
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,200
That is not an aphrodisiac.

119
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,070
I've explained to her clearly.

120
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,160
Your Excellency,

121
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,480
after arriving in Beiqi,

122
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,790
I won't go back to Nanqing ever again.

123
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,550
If you tell me,

124
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
I won't tell your wife.

125
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,670
Now I can't clear my name

126
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,920
even if I jump into the Yellow River.

127
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Which river is that?

128
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,760
I just made it up.

129
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,070
Do you know Haitang Duoduo?

130
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,790
Yes.

131
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,920
We once had tea together in Shangjing Town.

132
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,200
Is that the capital of Beiqi?

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
Yes.

134
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,230
She doesn't look like a Saintess.

135
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,720
I envy her character all the time.

136
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,200
She's free, easy, pure, and lovely.

137
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,640
You're perfect for each other.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,920
Let me ask you something.

139
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,640
Something private about Duoduo?

140
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,720
No!

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,350
I want to ask

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
why you took the arrow for me.

143
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,790
I...

144
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,830
I didn't intend to.

145
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,320
Seeing the arrow coming from the corner of my eye,

146
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,160
I just went to you.

147
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,350
I had no time to think.

148
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,110
To be honest,

149
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,040
I still regret it now.

150
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,550
Your Excellency, no need to bother.

151
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,040
After sending me back to Beiqi,

152
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,790
we're even.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,070
We'll reach Beiqi soon.

154
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,390
You're poisoned.

155
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,070
According to the Red Sleeve Edict Scheme,

156
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,270
your little emperor of Beiqi is supposed to

157
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
be killed by the poison on your body.

158
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,600
Why do you tell me?

159
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,320
This is the antidote.

160
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,110
Only after you're detoxified

161
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,670
can we really be even.

162
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,390
What about you?

163
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,000
Who would know I'm the one

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,790
to detoxify you?

165
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,350
The poison could be ineffective

166
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,390
due to a wrong formula.

167
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,550
If I give this away,

168
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,110
you'll be in trouble, right?

169
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,910
Will you?

170
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,590
Who knows what will happen in future?

171
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,790
Then let's wait and see.

172
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,790
Your Excellency, your hair style is good.

173
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,080
Your clothes are so bright and shining.

174
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,200
Well, leave us alone.

175
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,710
Senior.

176
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,840
We've arrived in Beiqi.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
It's your last chance

178
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,840
to kill me.

179
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,150
What's your hidden secret?

180
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,520
This is also your last chance to question me.

181
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,910
Why did you ask me

182
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,030
about Danzhou?

183
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,080
What's your relation with Danzhou?

184
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,640
Fine.

185
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,400
Senior Xiao,

186
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,470
let's make a bet.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,670
This won't be my last question

188
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,760
for you.

189
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,000
You're home.

190
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,200
Now that we're in Beiqi,

191
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,520
I won't be able to visit you often.

192
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,590
Take care of yourself.

193
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,520
Your Excellency, thank you for looking after me all the way.

194
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,470
Who is to receive us?

195
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
Your Excellency, it's weird.

196
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,150
There are people receiving us,

197
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,840
but no one answers back.

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,150
I'll say it one more time.

199
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,230
The Nanqing mission is here to return prisoners of war.

200
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,520
Who's in charge?

201
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,440
Please answer back at once.

202
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,880
If you remain silent, we'll leave right away.

203
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,150
Your Excellency, they're here.

204
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,400
What are you waiting for?

205
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,200
Your Excellency!

206
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,320
=Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards=

207
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,980
Are they here?
=Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards=

208
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,030
Are they here?

209
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,880
Excuse me, which one is His Excellency Fan Xian,

210
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,470
the Poetic Genius from Nanqing?

211
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,960
This is His Excellency Fan Xian,

212
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,640
Envoy of Nanqing.

213
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,470
Poetic Genius Fan!

214
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,590
I'm Fan Xian.

215
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I've looked up to your great name for a long time!

216
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,080
On seeing you today,

217
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,910
you're really outstanding as expected.

218
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,000
You are?

219
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm Shen Zhong.

220
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,030
Just call me by my name.

221
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,280
Your Excellency Shen,
Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

222
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,960
You two should deal with

223
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,150
the handover procedures.

224
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,400
Yes, Your Excellency.

225
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,110
Your Excellency Fan, have you heard of me?

226
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,080
Yes.

227
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,030
Your Excellency Shen, why not wear your robe?

228
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,550
My robe doesn't fit.

229
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,880
It's being altered in Shangjing.

230
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,280
Your Excellency Fan, I beg you pardon.

231
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,200
That's fine! That's fine!

232
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,230
Where's Miss Si?

233
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,030
This way, please.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Your Excellency Shen, won't you check her out?

235
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,880
It's fine. The mammies will handle it.

236
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,640
By the imperial edict of His Majesty,

237
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,520
Miss Si, we're here to escort you to Shangjing.

238
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,960
Please come with us.

239
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,640
I'm a new official.

240
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,350
In a high position at such a young age,

241
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,910
you do have a successful official career.

242
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,790
I'm just lucky.

243
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,230
Your Excellency Shen, I'm really flattered.

244
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,910
You're the one

245
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,000
who's really in a high position.

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,710
Miss Si, you're injured?

247
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,400
Hold her.

248
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,960
Miss Si is injured!

249
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,840
Mammy,

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,150
on our way here,

251
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,230
some bandits pretended to be

252
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,400
the followers of Shangshan Hu,

253
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,470
trying to take Xiao En away.

254
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,670
Miss Si was shot accidentally.

255
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,640
She's fine now.

256
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,790
How can you let her be injured?

257
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,710
Do you want to lose your head?

258
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,230
Who is she?

259
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,880
She's an old servant in the imperial palace.

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
Your Excellency Shen, no need to be flattering.

261
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,200
Unlike Nanqing,

262
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,470
Beiqi is a great country.

263
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,000
Such a great country was actually

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,670
so defeated as to cede territory for mercy.

265
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,200
What did you just say?

266
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,590
I said Beiqi lost the war

267
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,550
and was utterly humiliated.

268
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,590
How dare you!

269
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,350
Let go of me!

270
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,960
Mammy!

271
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,350
Let go!

272
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,080
-Let go! -Fine.

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,550
We Nanqing people are straight-forward.

274
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,670
You asked me to let go, so I let go.

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,080
Come on! Get up!

276
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,000
Look at you!

277
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,550
How could you watch him violate me

278
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,350
on our territory?

279
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,760
Humiliating the envoy equals humiliating Nanqing.

280
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
If the war is restarted,

281
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
whose responsibility might that be?

282
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
You! You!

283
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,960
Mammy! Mammy!

284
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,550
Calm down!

285
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,910
-Come on! -I'm so pissed!

286
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,710
Come on! Calm down! Calm down!

287
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,910
That bastard

288
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,960
is too arrogant!

289
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,200
Take care!

290
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,840
Your Excellency Fan.

291
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,200
Where is Xiao En?

292
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,110
Your Excellency Xiao En!

293
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,030
Who are you?

294
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm Shen Zhong,

295
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,030
Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

296
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,400
I don't know you.

297
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,550
Sure! Sure! Sure!

298
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,470
When Your Excellency Xiao
rode the whirlwind in Nanqing and Beiqi,

299
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,790
I was nobody.

300
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,000
Your name is widely known.

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,320
I feel so excited

302
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,470
to finally see you in person.

303
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,960
Your Excellency Fan,

304
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,200
we'll escort His Excellency Xiao

305
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,670
from now on.

306
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,960
Of course.

307
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,560
Your Excellency Fan,

308
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,640
you just said that some people tried to

309
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,590
save His Excellency Xiao along the way.

310
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,230
I stopped them.

311
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,880
Your Excellency Xiao,

312
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,190
that's not right.

313
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,000
Look around!

314
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,280
You're home now.

315
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
Why do you want to run away?

316
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,160
If you run away again halfway,

317
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,190
I won't be able to fulfill my task.

318
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Right?

319
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,560
What do you want?

320
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,830
We should take our work

321
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,280
seriously.

322
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,040
Now it should be fine.

323
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,760
Your Excellency Xiao, I'll take you to your carriage.

324
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,830
Knowing that you're coming back,

325
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,760
the Embroidered Uniform Guards

326
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,950
have specially made

327
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,040
an iron carriage for you.

328
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,830
It's an honor

329
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,230
no one else can enjoy.

330
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,190
Sorry to let you see this.

331
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,400
Your Excellency Shen,

332
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,680
how can you be so cruel to your people

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,160
but flattering to someone from Nanqing?

334
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,590
Shame on you!

335
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,590
Calm down! Calm down!

336
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,280
Calm down!

337
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,040
I'll report your behaviors to

338
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,400
the Empress Dowager.

339
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,160
Wait a moment, please.

340
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,640
Please come with me.

341
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,590
What do you want?

342
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,800
I have my difficulty.

343
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,000
You'll know it after I tell you.

344
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,520
Come on! Come on! Come on!

345
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,880
Come on! Come on!

346
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,760
Your Excellency Fan, wait a minute.

347
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,230
Why do you have to

348
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,400
talk here?

349
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,350
I know after serving the Empress Dowager for many years,

350
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,070
you're bonded with Her Majesty.

351
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,160
Do you want me to spare your life?

352
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,950
It seems that

353
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,000
you don't know me after all.

354
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,190
Sorry to keep you waiting.

355
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

356
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
It's weird.

357
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,520
Anyhow,

358
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,950
after talking with her,

359
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,310
she felt so ashamed

360
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,350
that she left on her own,

361
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,880
saying that she would never go back to Shangjing.

362
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,880
Do you have anything to say?

363
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,560
Different people have different aspirations. Just let her go.

364
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,430
Let's get ready and set off soon.

365
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,430
His Majesty is anxious

366
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,400
to meet His Excellency Fan.

367
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,070
Meet me? Why?

368
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,760
You'll know when you arrive in Shangjing.

369
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,880
By the way, Your Excellency Fan,

370
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,350
how's Head Chen doing recently?

371
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,350
He's fine.

372
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,310
Your Excellency Fan,

373
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,310
a word please.

374
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,040
Come on.

375
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,710
Your Excellency Fan, did Head Chen give you

376
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,710
any task this time?

377
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,520
To take Yan Bingyun back.

378
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,190
Nothing else?

379
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,520
What else can there be?

380
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,190
Let me make a bold guess.

381
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,190
If I guess wrong,

382
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,640
please don't laugh at me.

383
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,710
Firstly,

384
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,640
you should take Yan Bingyun back of course.

385
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,880
Secondly, since His Excellency Xiao is back,

386
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,800
Head Chen must be too worried to sleep.

387
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,560
Perhaps he asked you to

388
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
assassinate His Excellency Xiao.

389
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,830
Find the chance to kill Xiao En

390
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,400
after taking back Yan Bingyun.

391
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,040
Anything else?

392
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,230
His Majesty himself specially requested

393
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,310
Si Lili be sent back.

394
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,110
It's a good chance to set a trap.

395
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,640
On our way back,

396
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,800
I'll check whether Miss Si Lili

397
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,680
is OK or not.

398
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,950
I made the poison of

399
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,830
Red Sleeve Edict myself.

400
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,880
By the way,

401
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,710
Yan Bingyun is caught,

402
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,950
but he isn't the only secret agent

403
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,520
from the Investigator's Office

404
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,710
in Beiqi.

405
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,710
Did Head Chen send you here

406
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,470
to reorganize the intelligence network?

407
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,350
Stay vigilant to one person.

408
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,230
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

409
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,830
You must be careful with him.

410
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,950
It mustn't be someone good

411
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,920
who can be remembered by you.

412
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,950
If so,

413
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,000
what are you going to do?

414
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,230
Nonsense! Nonsense!

415
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,880
Your Excellency Fan, never mind.

416
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,350
Whatever you want to do

417
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,680
in Shangjing,

418
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,950
I'll keep you company.

419
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,880
Let's set off.

420
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,190
Your mission can follow us.

421
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,830
Your Excellency.

422
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,560
All my tasks in Beiqi,

423
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,160
he has guessed them right.

424
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,800
Shen Zhong does live up to his name.

425
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,520
Then what should we do?

426
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,950
Just wait and see.

427
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,430
Shangjing Town of Beiqi

428
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,160
will be our battlefield.

429
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,190
Xiao En suffers a lot

430
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,350
from Shen Zhong along the way.

431
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,230
Your Excellency,

432
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,110
I just don't get it.

433
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,040
Xiao En used to be

434
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,070
an important official of Beiqi.

435
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,430
Why does Shen Zhong torture him?

436
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,040
Who knows?

437
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,760
Who's there?

438
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,800
Assassin! Catch that assassin!

439
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,280
Everyone! Assassin!

440
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,190
Assassin!

441
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,310
There's an assassin raiding the camps.

442
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,950
What should we do?

443
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,190
The assassin is raiding Beiqi's camps.

444
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
We're kind enough

445
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
not to join the attack.

446
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,350
That's right.

447
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,070
Here!

448
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,400
Circle the assassin around!

449
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,280
Don't let the assassin run away.

450
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,880
The assassin failed.

451
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
Get the assassin! Come on!

452
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,710
Stop!

453
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,830
The assassin runs into Nanqing's camps.

454
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,070
There's no one in the tent behind me.

455
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,280
Thank you.

456
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,520
A woman?

457
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,680
Who's she?

458
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Who else can she be?

459
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,350
Which one?

460
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,920
That Saintess he fought at start but fell in love with later.

461
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,950
Cut the crap! Don't seek death!

462
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,880
Put your weapons down! Put them down!

463
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
Make no mistake.

464
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,950
Your Excellency Fan, sorry to bother you.

465
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,280
An assassin raided our camps. Sorry to let you see this.

466
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,880
I saw the assassin running this way.

467
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,800
I wonder whether you saw the assassin or not.

468
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,640
I saw her.

469
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,040
She's in the tent behind me.

470
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,430
Just go inside and search.

471
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,640
Don't you want to imply

472
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,000
our Nanqing mission is behind the assassination?

473
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,560
Your Excellency Shen,

474
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
what about capturing me as well?

475
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,710
Your Excellency Fan,

476
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,520
don't be angry.

477
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,430
If the assassin takes order from you,

478
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,830
she wouldn't have run to you.

479
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,350
How can I not know that?

480
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,110
She was running towards that direction.

481
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,680
You still don't believe me, right?

482
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,560
Come on! Come on! Come on!

483
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,590
Your Excellency Shen,

484
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,760
search the tent yourself.

485
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,470
No need! No need! No need!

486
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,760
Go back.

487
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,560
Go back to your posts.

488
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,560
Your Excellency Fan,

489
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,350
I'm really sorry.

490
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,590
Sorry to bother you.

491
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,070
Please accept my apology.

492
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,520
Your Excellency Fan, you also love to eat sweet potatoes.

493
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,160
They are good stuff.

494
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,520
Fragrant and sweet to eat.

495
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Your Excellency Shen, won't you chase after the assassin?

496
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,470
I didn't catch the assassin just now.

497
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,040
Now I won't be able to catch the assassin.

498
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,190
Was the assassin injured by you?

499
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,070
It's Xiao En's blood.

500
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,800
I was talking with Senior Xiao

501
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,710
just now.

502
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,280
Your Excellency Shen,

503
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,920
what on earth do you want to know?

504
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,040
I don't know.

505
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,430
You don't know?

506
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,680
I really don't.

507
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,310
I just know that

508
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,070
Chen Pingping kept him alive for so long

509
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,760
because of the secret he knows.

510
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,520
The Empress Dowager and His Majesty

511
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,800
want to know what it is.

512
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,710
Since Senior Xiao doesn't want to tell me,

513
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,430
I have to ask him often.

514
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,950
He was an important official

515
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,280
of Beiqi.

516
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,640
Circumstances change with the passage of time.

517
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,430
Plus he's the adoptive father of Shangshan Hu,

518
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
he needs to be warned.

519
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,830
Isn't Shangshan Hu the Beiqi War God?

520
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,470
He's good at fighting battles indeed.

521
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,560
But that may not be a good thing.

522
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,040
Your Excellency Fan, to be honest,

523
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,470
Shangshan Hu is transferred back to Shangjing.

524
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,400
Nominally, he is the Grand General,

525
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,310
but actually he's only got
one hundred private soldiers by his side.

526
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,470
A promotion nominally but a demotion in fact,

527
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,470
he has lost the military power.

528
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,470
Indeed.

529
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,000
But he is to blame

530
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
for not understanding the situation.

531
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,830
In such a complicated situation,
he neither pledges allegiance to His Majesty

532
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,310
nor visits the Empress Dowager.

533
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,160
As officials,

534
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,560
if you're not loyal,

535
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,230
what can you get? Right?

536
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,830
Then whose side are you on?

537
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,950
I'm loyal to the Empress Dowager.

538
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,520
Your Excellency Shen,

539
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,680
you're really outspoken.

540
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,350
I admire scholars

541
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,470
all the time.

542
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,280
Your Excellency Fan, talented as you are in poetry,

543
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,760
have you written any masterpiece recently?

544
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,880
Well, have you figured out

545
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,280
the secret?

546
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,680
He refuses to talk. No hurry.

547
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,560
There's still a long time ahead.

548
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,950
You've made

549
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,760
Xiao En suffer.

550
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
If he stages a comeback

551
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,830
in future,

552
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,880
he surely will get back at you.

553
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,950
Chen Pingping is worried, right?

554
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,520
When you're back, tell Head Chen that

555
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,760
Xiao En has no chance.

556
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,070
Just think about it.

557
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,430
Even now, there's an assassin

558
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,400
trying to kill him.

559
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,640
Many people want him dead in Beiqi.

560
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,230
The number is no less than that of Nanqing.

561
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,110
Well then, I will interrupt you no more.

562
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
We're about to reach Shangjing.

563
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,190
Just like I said,

564
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,230
man should understand the situation.

565
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,800
Your Excellency Fan,

566
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,880
don't make it hard for me.

567
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,560
Take your time and enjoy the food.

568
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,430
Take them away.

569
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,470
He serves the Empress Dowager.

570
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,160
So do you.

571
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,310
How come you two

572
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,350
are fighting each other?

573
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,160
My teacher wants to kill Xiao En.

574
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,280
As an apprentice, I have to obey her order.

575
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,400
So I kind of saved your life.

576
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,830
You lifted the curtain just now.

577
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,070
I'm bluffing. Don't you understand?

578
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,950
What if your plan doesn't work

579
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,000
and he actually catches me?

580
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,230
Then so be it.

581
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,310
How is that relevant to me?

582
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,070
Is it a joke for you?

583
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,520
Will you assassinate Xiao En again?

584
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,830
I have no chance.

585
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,070
After entering Shangjing, I have no way to kill him.

586
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,470
Then when we reach Shangjing,

587
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,280
let's cooperate with each other.

588
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,830
How?

589
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,800
Anyway you like.

590
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,280
Whoever you find annoying,

591
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,310
I'll help you deal with him.

592
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,280
By collaborating with me from within,

593
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,400
we can bring trouble to the country.

594
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,160
What's in it for you?

595
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,280
I'm from Nanqing.

596
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,040
The more chaotic Beiqi is,

597
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
the happier I will be.

598
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm leaving.

599
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Just think about it.

600
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,560
She's gone?

601
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,800
Really?

602
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,800
She's gone.

603
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,880
It seems that Beiqi is really chaotic.

604
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,000
This might be our chance.

605
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,070
Right,

606
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,920
we can seize the chance to take the Saintess back.

607
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,520
What're you thinking?

608
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,110
It's our chance to fulfill the mission task.

609
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,280
Right! Right! Right!

610
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,560
It's a good excuse to fool the public.

611
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,230
Right!

612
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,760
Lend me some money.

613
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,520
Give me silver instead of bank notes.

614
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,160
I'll pay you twice as much when we go back to the capital city.

615
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,000
Twice?

616
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,110
You two, turn around.

617
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,560
What's up?

618
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,670
At dawn tomorrow,

619
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:25,840
you should leave on your own.

620
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,390
Don't let others see you.

621
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,910
Go south to Shangjing Town,

622
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,320
and find a Tiaowang Inn.

623
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
Take the money, get yourself a room,

624
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,230
and stay there.

625
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,520
Why should I listen to you?

626
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,470
Only by helping me complete the task of the Investigator's Office

627
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,760
can you get your father out of the jail.

628
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,470
Your Excellency, as you commanded,

629
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,950
our agents watch the place closely

630
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,150
and see a man from the Nanqing mission

631
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,390
slip away secretly.

632
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
Now he stays in an inn south of Shangjing.

633
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,470
Should we catch him?

634
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,670
Leave him alone.

635
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,600
Let him stay there

636
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,870
as if we don't know.

637
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,470
Let's see what His Excellency Fan

638
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,320
will do next.

639
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,520
Yes.

640
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,120
Your Excellency, we've arrived in Shangjing Town.

641
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,190
After taking Yan Bingyun back,

642
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,520
we can go home.

643
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,430
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

644
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,280
Your Excellency, you feel something might go wrong.

645
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,000
Look.

646
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,080
Here comes trouble.

647
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,470
Grand General!

648
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,950
Whatever it is,

649
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,190
just send me a message.

650
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,600
How come you're here in person?

651
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,360
I want to see him?

652
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,560
See whom?

653
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,800
My adoptive father.

654
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,120
Who's your adoptive father?

655
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,360
Xiao En.

656
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,000
So Senior Xiao

657
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,560
is actually your adoptive father.

658
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,630
It's true that man from a military family

659
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,600
is bound to be extraordinary.

660
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,000
Where is he?

661
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,280
He's here! He's here!

662
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,470
Why is he so tortured?

663
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,080
I interrogated him according to the imperial edict.

664
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,760
You did this to him?

665
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,390
Yes.

666
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,840
Grand General, since he's your father,

667
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,120
you can have a closer look at him.

668
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,710
It's a pity that

669
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,120
I broke his legs,

670
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,760
or you might see him

671
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,360
stand up.

672
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,800
Grand General, are you satisfied with what you see?

673
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,670
Give him to me.

674
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,710
I'm afraid I can't.

675
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,560
How dare you defy my order?

676
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,560
Grand General, you don't know.

677
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,560
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager of Beiqi

678
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,040
ordered me to lock Xiao En up

679
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
in the Division of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

680
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,670
I can't defy the imperial order.

681
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,800
Grand General, what else can I do for you?

682
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,360
Shen Zhong,

683
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,190
good for you.

684
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,040
Grand General, thank you for the compliment.

685
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,230
I'm just loyal to my country.

686
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,280
Your Excellency,

687
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,280
Shen Zhong is not good at dealing with other officials.

688
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,470
Right.

689
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,800
He's vicious and cruel,

690
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,520
but he's too arrogant

691
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,910
to restrain himself.

692
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,520
It will definitely get him into trouble.

693
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,910
Exactly.

694
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,280
Shangshan Hu almost

695
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,040
attacked him just now.

696
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,630
He did it on purpose.

697
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,870
On purpose?

698
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,280
From breaking Xiao En's legs on the border

699
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,600
to torturing Xiao En cruelly along the way,

700
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,560
he did all that to provoke Shangshan Hu.

701
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,280
Make Shangshan Hu attack him?

702
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,760
After all, Shangshan Hu has brilliant achievements in war.

703
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
To punish him,

704
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,430
there should be a reason.

705
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,870
By making him attack the mission,

706
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,950
Shangshan Hu can be accused of defying the imperial edict.

707
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,230
I'm afraid he will also

708
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,230
be accused of treason.

709
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,670
Who gave the order,

710
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,950
the Empress Dowager of Beiqi or the little emperor?

711
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,280
Maybe both.

712
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,600
I didn't expect Shangshan Hu

713
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,320
to be so feared in Beiqi.

714
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,760
It's a good thing.

715
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,600
Really?

716
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,430
Your Excellency Fan,

717
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,560
His Majesty is anxious to see you.

718
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,630
I'm sorry that

719
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,630
you'll have to first meet His Majesty in the imperial palace

720
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,870
and then go to your residence.

721
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,520
We can go inside now.

722
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,120
Won't Miss Si Lili go to the imperial palace?

723
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,280
She has no status.

724
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,080
She should live outside the imperial palace
and wait for the chance.

725
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,840
Are you familiar with Miss Lili?

726
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,710
I caught her.

727
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,870
Won't Xiao En's carriage go inside the town?

728
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,870
He will go inside from the West Gate.

729
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,670
You also see what happened just now.

730
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,430
We don't know what will happen

731
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,560
when we go inside.

732
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,190
When two counties are at war, no messengers shall be killed.

733
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,520
Nanqing has won a landslide victory this time.

734
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,910
When entering the town,

735
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,430
we certainly won't see people
welcoming us on both sides of the street,

736
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,390
but they can't go so far as to throw rotten eggs at us.

737
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,870
Get out of Beiqi!

738
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,950
No envoy from Nanqing is welcome!

739
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,190
You! Get off!

740
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,600
Nanqing dogs!

741
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,280
You're not welcome! You're not welcome!

742
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,560
Get out of Beiqi! Get off!

743
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,760
Throw at him!

744
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,760
Get off! Get off!

745
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,280
Get off! Get off!

746
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,040
You're not welcome in Beiqi!

747
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,910
There're vegetables and eggs

748
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,320
enough for several meals.

749
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,190
Let's add dishes tonight.

750
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,560
Yes, Your Excellency.

751
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,320
Get off!

752
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,390
Get off, Nanqing dogs!

753
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,560
You're not welcome!

754
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,430
Get out of Beiqi.

755
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,520
Our people are concerned about national affairs.

756
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,950
Since we lost the battle,

757
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,280
they can't help feeling angry.

758
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm afraid they're not all common people.

759
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,230
You killed Cheng Jushu,

760
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,430
the martial arts master of Beiqi, on the street.

761
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,670
Men in the army and on the streets who practice martial arts

762
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,600
want to learn from you.

763
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,840
They are not bound by rules.

764
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,560
They might assassinate you or make a sneak attack.

765
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,150
You'd better hide in the carriage.

766
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,230
It won't take long.

767
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,710
The Embroidered Uniform Guards

768
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,560
can't even keep their own capital under control?

769
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm really not competent enough.

770
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,320
Sorry! Sorry!

771
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,430
As the envoy of Nanqing,

772
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,710
if I hide in the carriage

773
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,840
on my way to the imperial palace,

774
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
I'm afraid I'll dishonor

775
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,230
my country completely.

776
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,390
If you don't hide,

777
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,150
with more rotten vegetables and worn-out shoes coming,

778
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,950
it's not so honorable, either.

779
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,760
So I'll dishonor

780
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,840
my country either way.

781
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,040
I just can't quell the public anger.

782
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,320
You're really good.

783
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
You misunderstood me.

784
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,630
Wait!

785
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,710
Gao.

786
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,910
There's a long roll of cloth on the carriage

787
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,040
behind which carries cargos.

788
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,950
Bring it to me.

789
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,040
Yes, Your Excellency.

790
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,860
In the river of history,

791
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,060
time goes round and round.

792
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,420
Memories about the former and present lives

793
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,300
join each other in an endless way.

794
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,900
In the long drunken Milky Way,

795
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,620
one season follows another in a flash,

796
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,820
and the wild geese are flying south.

797
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,740
I just can't give up

798
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,740
to be with you for my whole life.

799
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:41,020
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

800
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

801
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,700
Year after year in the wandering,

802
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,260
I count the remaining years.

803
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,460
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

804
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,020
even though we have ended up the destiny,

805
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,700
I never feel regretful.

806
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,660
In such a chaotic world,

807
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,420
I still miss you as ever.

808
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,060
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

809
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,780
With a gentle heart,

810
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,340
I cherish our remaining years.

811
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,180
Even though we have to go through

812
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,140
all the hardships along the journey,

813
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:20,460
you always stay by my side,

814
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,220
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

815
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,140
Year after year in the wandering,

816
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,500
I count the remaining years.

817
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,860
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

818
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,660
even though we end up the destiny,

819
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,100
I never feel regretful.

820
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,020
In such a chaotic world,

821
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,980
I still miss you as ever.

822
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,660
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

823
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,420
With a gentle heart,

824
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,820
I cherish our remaining years.

825
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,620
Even though we have to go through

826
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,780
all the hardships along the journey,

827
00:44:52,300 --> 00:45:01,060
you always stay by my side...
