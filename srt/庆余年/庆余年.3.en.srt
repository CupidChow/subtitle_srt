1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 3

16
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,510
What does the temple worship?

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,720
Any temple for worshipping is a divine temple.

18
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,760
How could you not know that?

19
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,440
Divine temple?

20
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,910
When heaven was separated
from earth, giant monsters ran wild.

21
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,400
Master from the divine temple
came to earth with dignity and virtue,

22
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,160
teaching mankind characters and etiquette

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,550
and helping mankind cutting mountains and making seas,

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,310
thus laying foundation for the human race.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
Haven't you learned that from your parents?

26
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,520
Mythology.

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,600
You really don't know who I am?

28
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,440
Anyway, don't step into the main hall.

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,470
No ambushes.

30
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,800
Is it really a coincidence?

31
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,000
No statue of God as I expected.

32
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,240
Mythology.

33
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,520
For me, I never believe in God.

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,030
Yet, I don't know

35
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,440
how I came to the world.

36
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,440
If there really is a divine temple,

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,750
please do send down an envoy

38
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,720
to explain to me.

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,390
If you give me the answer,

40
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,390
I will do you the favor of

41
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,030
believing in you.

42
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,830
Food and accommodation all covered.
Just think about it.

43
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,550
My Lady!

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,550
My Lady!

45
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,270
Have you seen My Lady?

46
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,200
No.

47
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,230
My Lady! My Lady!

48
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
=Lin Wan'er, daughter of Nanqing Prime Minister Lin Ruofu=

49
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
I have a question for you.

50
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,920
Are you an assassin?

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,390
Not really.

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,720
Then, are you sent by the God?

53
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,390
Not really either.

54
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,230
I think you are.

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,550
Who... who are you?

56
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
Are you OK?

57
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,350
I'm fine.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,670
After vomiting several times, I just get used to it.

59
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,070
My Lady! My Lady!

60
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,550
Are you leaving?

61
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,600
Are you with that man of importance

62
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,390
in the main hall?

63
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,070
Hand, please.

64
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,600
I forgot to ask her name.

65
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,320
My Lady, where have you been?

66
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,390
I'm so worried.

67
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,720
My Lady, are you OK?

68
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm fine.

69
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,320
My Lady, how come you're smiling.

70
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,950
You run about every time we come out.

71
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,270
I'm so sacred.

72
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,070
I'm certainly happy to come out.

73
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,070
It's better than taking drugs everyday

74
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,790
in my room.

75
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,040
The imperial physician said

76
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,480
sick as you are, you can't afford to catch a cold.

77
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,920
My Lady, how come you cough blood again?

78
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm fine.

79
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,760
I just

80
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
get used to it.

81
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,510
Oh no, you're confused.

82
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,760
Rise and go!

83
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,350
When did you get back?

84
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,840
Young Master, I've waited for a long time.

85
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,960
Follow that carriage!

86
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,440
Where are you going?

87
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,080
That way.

88
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Well.

89
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,350
Young Master, aren't we going back the mansion?

90
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,280
Who told you to go to the mansion?

91
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,080
Follow that carriage!

92
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,230
Make a turn.

93
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,550
Make a turn!

94
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,640
Over there!

95
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,200
OK!

96
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,550
Over there! That carriage!

97
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,110
Make way!

98
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,350
Make way! Make way! Make way!

99
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,200
Make way!

100
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,670
Guards, clear the street.

101
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,350
Make way!

102
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,640
Make way! Make way!

103
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,470
Make way!

104
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,790
Go away! Hurry up!

105
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,640
Make way!

106
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,320
Everyone! Hurry up!

107
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,150
Make way! Everyone!

108
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,080
Your Majesty, we can move forward now.

109
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,110
Rise and go!

110
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,710
Your Majesty, it's my fault

111
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,320
the young man suddenly appeared

112
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,230
during the worship ritual today.

113
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,200
Your Majesty, I'm willing to take punishments.

114
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:01,780
The worship ritual went on smoothly today.

115
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,660
The worship ritual went on smoothly today.
=Gong Dian, Deputy Director of Imperial Guards of Nanqing=

116
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,790
The worship ritual went on smoothly today.

117
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,840
You've done well.

118
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,320
Though today's worship ritual was not announced publicly,

119
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,590
the temple was well-guarded

120
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,640
by the imperial guards.

121
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,550
Yet, the young man was able to

122
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,760
pass various invisible sentries easily.

123
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,670
I'm afraid something was wrong.

124
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
I plead that

125
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,960
the imperial guards be investigated thoroughly.

126
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,590
You've hit him by palm.

127
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,760
Yes.

128
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,520
What do you think?

129
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,030
Possessing profound internal strength at such a young age,

130
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,590
he's kind of outstanding.

131
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,440
Your Majesty!

132
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,400
Considering what happened today,

133
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,840
we'd better investigate the imperial guards.

134
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,200
No need!

135
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,320
Stop him!

136
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,400
Ask him over.

137
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,110
Yes!

138
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Let him pass!

139
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,200
On the entrance road to the city,

140
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,960
there were maidservants
from the imperial harem trying to stop the carriage.

141
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,520
We've killed them all.

142
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,880
I see.

143
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,400
Some imperial guards came and left.

144
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,640
What a pity!

145
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,400
I can't hear their words clearly.

146
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,440
My Lady.

147
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,760
My Lady.

148
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,400
You've been smiling

149
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
after coming back from the Qing Temple.

150
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,400
Have you found

151
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,320
something interesting?

152
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,320
Nothing special.

153
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,640
I just met

154
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,790
someone interesting.

155
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,520
Others don't matter.

156
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,000
I just hope that

157
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,150
the Young Master of the Fan mansion

158
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,670
is also an interesting person

159
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,470
who can make you so happy.

160
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,440
I know you don't want to marry him.

161
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,230
But it's a marriage granted by His Majesty.

162
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,400
I...

163
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,350
Well...

164
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,150
Your Majesty!

165
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,820
=Emperor Qing, Nanqing's emperor=

166
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,760
Who's that young man?

167
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,280
He must be the bastard son of
Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue

168
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,640
from Danzhou.

169
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,000
He's called Fan Xian, I think.

170
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,030
Tell me what you think.

171
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,520
That young man suddenly appeared today.

172
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,590
It was not an accident.

173
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,440
It was...

174
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,470
It was arranged by Your Majesty.

175
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,000
Why should I arrange that?

176
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,790
I dare not guess Your Majesty's intentions.

177
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,150
Speak!

178
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,960
It's...

179
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,670
It's because Your Majesty wanted to see him.

180
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,440
On the entrance road to the city,

181
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
someone tried to ruin his reputation with maidservants.

182
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,440
Who do you think that might be?

183
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,440
I don't know.

184
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,910
You don't know? Or you dare not tell?

185
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,840
Judged from common sense, it might be the Crown Prince.

186
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,280
The Crown Prince?

187
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,440
By making such a guess,

188
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,080
I've already born the rebellious sin.

189
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,670
I just dare not keep silent

190
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
to Your Majesty's question.

191
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,000
Your Majesty, I'm willing to take punishments.

192
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,150
Did Fan Xian kneel down

193
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,790
in the side palace hall?

194
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,760
I've paid attention.

195
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,960
Fan Xian didn't kneel down in the Qing Temple.

196
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,470
Refuse to kneel down before the God.

197
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,280
It tastes bad.

198
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,150
But don't forget to leave

199
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,640
two taels of silver.

200
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,230
Yes.

201
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,880
Gong Dian.

202
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,790
Yes, Your Majesty!

203
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,670
I heard that the Crown Prince gave you a painting,

204
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,320
and you like it very much.

205
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,200
I acknowledge my sin!

206
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,000
Let's go back to the Imperial Palace.

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,520
It's natural for man to have hobbies.

208
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,840
That's no sin.

209
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,470
I see.

210
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,910
Here we are, Young Master.

211
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,200
Careful! Careful! Careful!

212
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,910
The carriage will be returned to the back door.

213
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,280
Young Master, please enter the mansion by yourself.

214
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,030
Return? You're not from the Fan mansion?

215
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,430
I am Fan Xian.

216
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
I am Fan Xian.

217
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,070
Young Master.

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,070
This way, please.

219
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,350
The side door?

220
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,560
Is that my father's order?

221
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,400
Master is still out in the Ministry of Revenue.

222
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,590
This is ordered by Madam Liu Ruyu.

223
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,190
If Liu Ruyu

224
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,470
really wants to kill you,

225
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,710
I'm afraid it won't be easy for you

226
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,590
to enter the Fan mansion.

227
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,000
Young Master, please come with me.

228
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,640
Why aren't people talking in the yard?

229
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,470
Madam Liu Ruyu is having an afternoon nap.

230
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,470
Where's she napping?

231
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,640
In the backyard.

232
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,310
She's napping in the backyard,

233
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,800
yet no one dares talk in the whole mansion!

234
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,470
Is she tough?

235
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,590
Young Master, please don't say that.

236
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,430
Keep your voice down. Stop talking.

237
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,590
She is certainly of means.

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,470
Stop!

239
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,800
Who's that?

240
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,520
That's the private adviser of the mansion
who's in charge of bookkeeping.

241
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,710
I can't hit you that far.

242
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,560
Stand here.

243
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,680
Keep running! Huh?

244
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,950
Hide! Huh?

245
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,000
Today, I'm gonna...

246
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,800
You're a bookkeeping guy,

247
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,920
but you runs faster than a rabbit.

248
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,350
Catch your breath before chasing him again.

249
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,340
=Fan Sizhe, second son of Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian=

250
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,830
Why do you hold a drumstick?

251
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,640
This is not a drumstick.

252
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,470
It's a girl.

253
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,680
Girl?

254
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,830
Do you understand?

255
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,590
Neither do I.

256
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,710
What's this?

257
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,430
I don't know.

258
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,110
You don't know?

259
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,160
Do you know who I am?

260
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,830
Probably.

261
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,520
All right.

262
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,430
Then open it for me.

263
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,590
Why not open it by yourself?

264
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,590
Has Fan Xian arrived at the inner yard?

265
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,470
Not yet, Madam.

266
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,470
What takes him so long?

267
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,160
Shall I go check out?

268
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,350
No hurry. Let him take time.

269
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:56,520
Liu Ruyu, Fan Xian's stepmother

270
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,800
When he arrives at the inner yard,
=Liu Ruyu, Fan Xian's stepmother=

271
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,540
let him wait inside the yard.
=Liu Ruyu, Fan Xian's stepmother=

272
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,560
let him wait inside the yard.

273
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,520
I'll see him after my nap.

274
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes.

275
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,950
Come on! Try harder!

276
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,590
Come on! Try harder!

277
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
Almost open! Almost!

278
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,710
Try harder! Try!

279
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,710
Come on! Almost open!

280
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,430
Come on! Come on! Come on!

281
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,430
Open it for me!

282
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
I can't open it, either.

283
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,280
You know where this is?

284
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,160
It's the Fan mansion.

285
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,190
Everyone here

286
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,880
respects me.

287
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,560
Whatever I ask them to do,

288
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,430
they'll do it.

289
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,280
Now, I'm asking you

290
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,430
to open the box for me.

291
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,430
There's something wrong with your words.

292
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,310
What's wrong?

293
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,920
You just said that

294
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,880
everyone here respects you.

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,520
Right.

296
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:31,880
You also said that

297
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,830
they'll obey whatever you say.

298
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,470
That's right.

299
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,190
Then what if you ask them

300
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,190
to beat you to death?

301
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,920
If they do what you say,

302
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,590
they'll have to hurt you,

303
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,830
which means they don't respect you.

304
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,760
If they don't beat you,

305
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
then they are not at your command.

306
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,000
See? You're self-contradictory.

307
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Only one of the two conditions can be satisfied.

308
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,040
Let's go.

309
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,040
That makes sense.

310
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Then what should I do?

311
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,640
I have to let them beat me to death.

312
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,680
They have to listen to me.

313
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
That won't do!

314
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,400
Whom will they follow after beating me to death?

315
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,000
Then they can't beat me to death.

316
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,470
But if they don't,

317
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,230
it means they are not at my command.

318
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,040
Is that my younger brother?

319
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,830
Yes.

320
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,680
Why did he chase the bookkeeping guy?

321
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,350
Madam Liu Ruyu is taking a nap.

322
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,430
He probably took the chance to ask for money.

323
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,950
The bookkeeping guy runs so fast.

324
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,830
Having been chased for years,

325
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,640
he is quite a runner now.

326
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,280
That kid has quite a temper.

327
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,230
I dare not talk of him behind his back.

328
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,590
Young Master Fan Xian,

329
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,950
we've arrived at the inner yard.

330
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,520
Where's Liu Ruyu?

331
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,920
Where's Madam Liu Ruyu?

332
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,470
Madam Liu Ruyu is napping inside.

333
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,350
She asked you to wait.

334
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,280
I'll wait inside.

335
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,590
Young Master, that's not appropriate.

336
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,680
Wait in the yard?

337
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,350
Then I'll wait here.

338
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,400
This yard is quite tranquil.

339
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,710
Your Highness, I'm honored to see you.

340
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,900
Haven't I told you before?

341
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:14,920
Haven't I told you before?
=Li Chengqian, the Crown Prince of Nanqing=

342
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,160
We both love calligraphy and painting,
=Li Chengqian, the Crown Prince of Nanqing=

343
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,380
Li Chengqian, the Crown Prince of Nanqing

344
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,190
and we share similar tastes and interests.

345
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,680
We are friends.

346
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
No need to be too polite.

347
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,230
These calligraphy works and paintings

348
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,760
are the most precious ones

349
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,000
I've collected over the years.

350
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,280
The rest of my collection

351
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,190
have been burnt to ashes.

352
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,710
From today on,

353
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,350
I have no hobbies.

354
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,280
This is the famous painting from the former dynasty

355
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,040
bestowed to me by Your Highness.

356
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,190
I beg Your Highness take it back.

357
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,040
Gong Dian, you don't have to do this.

358
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,830
Today, His Majesty said that

359
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,040
it's natural for man to have hobbies.

360
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,400
Your Highness, from today on,

361
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,590
I have no hobbies.

362
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,230
What on earth happened?

363
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,680
His Majesty went to the Qing Temple
for a worship ritual today.

364
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,830
Why wasn't the Board of Rites informed?

365
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,190
It was an incognito trip.

366
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,800
Later

367
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,230
in the Qing Temple,

368
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,830
His Majesty met a young man.

369
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,280
His name is Fan Xian.

370
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,950
Then what?

371
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,880
He's outside?

372
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,110
Yes, Madam.

373
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,280
He's standing there.

374
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,470
Anxious or angry?

375
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,230
Neither.

376
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,710
He said

377
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,760
he also wanted to nap for a while.

378
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,950
Haven't I told you to keep him in the yard?

379
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,520
Wait a minute!

380
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,280
Why does he hold a drumstick?

381
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,190
I've no idea.

382
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,830
He's been holding it all the way
since he entered the mansion.

383
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,640
And he doesn't take a bite.

384
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,800
Will it be a custom of Danzhou?

385
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,470
Forget it!

386
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,190
Who gave him the chair?

387
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,160
He grabbed it himself.

388
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,000
This young man from Danzhou

389
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,310
might not be easy to handle.

390
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,230
Then let's see him.

391
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,040
You must be Xian'er.

392
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,560
You must be tired after such a long way.

393
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,000
I did take a nap just now.

394
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,640
I don't mean to snub you.

395
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,830
That's fine. That's fine.

396
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,310
If you don't wake me up,

397
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,800
I might still be sleeping.

398
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Madam, have a seat.

399
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,470
The people in Danzhou are simple and honest.

400
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,590
Now look at you.

401
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,760
You're really raised well.

402
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,710
Though you lack certain grace,

403
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,000
you do seem naïve and natural.

404
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,470
Naïve and natural.

405
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,920
She suggests that I'm like a wild monkey!

406
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,310
Madam, you really flatter me.

407
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,470
Desolated as Danzhou is,

408
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,430
I've never met someone like you.

409
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,280
So elegant! So refined!

410
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
If I didn't know in advance,

411
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,880
I'm sure to mistake you as the principle wife of my father.

412
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,350
The little bastard is suggesting

413
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,070
I'm only a concubine.

414
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,760
Where's the man with a box?

415
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,000
Well.

416
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,640
I came out so hurriedly

417
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,230
that I forgot to take my reception gift

418
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,400
for you.

419
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,280
Wait a minute.

420
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,950
Where is he?

421
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,590
I've seen you. Stay where you are.

422
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,760
I'll beat you to death when I get over.

423
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,110
I've figured it out.

424
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,760
Why should I

425
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,110
beat myself to death?

426
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,280
How should I know?

427
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,560
Are you playing me?

428
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,590
What do you think?

429
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,470
Madam, Young Master didn't get the money,

430
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,190
so he's really irritable now.

431
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm afraid he'll go violent.

432
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,160
I know.

433
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,350
Why else do I excuse myself?

434
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,000
If I'm there,

435
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,160
he will be restrained.

436
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,310
What if Young Master

437
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,310
really beats up Fan Xian?

438
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,160
My son is legitimate.

439
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,070
Fan Xian is just a bastard.

440
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,230
They're radically different.

441
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,520
If Fan Xian is beaten up

442
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,350
the first day he enters our mansion,

443
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,350
he will be looked down upon ever since.

444
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,430
But Madam,

445
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,110
I heard that Fan Xian can practice martial arts.

446
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,040
What if

447
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,040
he beats Young Master up

448
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,230
instead?

449
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,830
Just let him.

450
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,040
Beating up the legitimate son upon arrival at our mansion,

451
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,000
and being ferocious and mischievous
without due respect for the hierarchy,

452
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,190
how can my husband keep him?

453
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,070
Don't you think

454
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,430
you're a bit out of line?

455
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,590
I'm still standing.

456
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,070
How come you are seated?

457
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,760
Stand up!

458
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,470
Give me your hand!

459
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,590
Where's everyone?

460
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,190
How did you enter the inner yard?

461
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,070
Who the hell are you?

462
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,830
Fan Xian.

463
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,710
Fan Xian.

464
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,160
You're that bastard son

465
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,070
from Danzhou?

466
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,280
I actually thought you're somebody!

467
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,950
Considering your status,

468
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,190
how dare you trick me?

469
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,590
Give me you hand!

470
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,880
What's wrong with my status?

471
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,160
I'm your elder brother.

472
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,110
Elder brother is like father.

473
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,880
In that sense,

474
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,070
I'm your father.

475
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,070
I'm so pissed! I...

476
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,040
Stop!

477
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,520
Ruoruo!

478
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,070
=Fan Ruoruo, daughter of Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian=

479
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,420
Brother!
=Fan Ruoruo, daughter of Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian=

480
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:46,640
Brother!

481
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,350
I told you I would come.

482
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,310
You're always my elder brother.

483
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,640
Always!

484
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,470
Will you come to the capital city again?

485
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,040
One day, I will.

486
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,590
Kneel down!

487
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,430
I just met the bookkeeping guy.

488
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,880
You tried to bully him again!

489
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,110
He... he ran so fast.

490
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,470
How could I catch him?

491
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,830
Aren't you supposed to

492
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,040
be studying now?

493
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,830
I can pardon you for all these!

494
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,760
Really?

495
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,830
Kneel back!

496
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,040
Give it to me.

497
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,800
Sister, you just said you could pardon me!

498
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,590
Give it to me!

499
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,430
Now I punish you

500
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,830
for being rude to our elder brother.

501
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,190
-He's just a bastard! -Open your hand!

502
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,830
Sister, you actually beat me for a stranger!

503
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,560
Fan Sizhe!

504
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,560
The other hand!

505
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,560
Never call our elder brother by his name!

506
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,590
Nor can you show disrespect!

507
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,070
If it ever happens again, I'll punish you again!

508
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,190
Do you remember?

509
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,430
Get up!

510
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,160
Grown up as he is,

511
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,520
he turns to mom for help all the time.

512
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,830
Mom! Mom!

513
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,040
Brother, how's your trip?

514
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,160
Come over to my room.

515
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,680
Who came up with the name

516
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,520
Fan Sizhe? 
(Same pronunciation with Versace in Chinese)

517
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,520
Father did! What's wrong?

518
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,430
Really nice!

519
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm glad he beat you!

520
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,830
I was... Stop drinking!

521
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,950
I was beaten!

522
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,640
When your father come back,

523
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,760
tell him that

524
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,590
you were beaten.

525
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,830
It's useless to tell him.

526
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,190
Dad is the one who asks my elder sister to discipline me!

527
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,680
Ruoruo is the one who beat you?

528
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,710
Yes! Who dare beat me

529
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,800
but her?

530
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,520
Haven't I sent her away

531
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,430
from home?

532
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,040
How come she's back?

533
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,160
How can I know?

534
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't care.

535
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,430
Anyway, my hand aches now.

536
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,430
What can I do to ease you pain?

537
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,470
It'll be fine

538
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,680
with money on it.

539
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,640
Look at you!

540
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,310
How can you beat that fox

541
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,350
from Danzhou?

542
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,160
I can beat him if I have money.

543
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,070
You!

544
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,470
The handwriting of Zhuang Mohan,

545
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,760
a famous writer from Beiqi.

546
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,040
You like his handwriting?

547
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,560
It's a gift from others.

548
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,590
The sword once used by Si Gujian,

549
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,950
a great master from Dongyi Town.

550
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,040
The sword of a great master?

551
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,280
Really?

552
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,520
I don't know. It's also a gift.

553
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,830
Those jades and antiques

554
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,800
are all gifts.

555
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,760
Lend me a box.

556
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,760
Take the wooden one in the middle.

557
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,190
Who gave you all these gifts?

558
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,000
Just young ladies from eminent families.

559
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,800
Why?

560
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,880
Asking for updates.

561
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,040
What?

562
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,160
The letters you wrote to me

563
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,680
contain many chapters of

564
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,000
the Red Mansions.

565
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,640
The young ladies

566
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,800
who visited me occasionally saw it

567
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,950
and found it marvelous.

568
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,400
Words spread so fast.

569
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,350
Now all the unmarried young ladies

570
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,760
in the capital city

571
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
are fans of your book.

572
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,880
They give me gifts every day

573
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,230
for updates.

574
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,920
Where did you learn

575
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,520
the word "update"?

576
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,590
From your letters.

577
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,830
I just borrowed it.

578
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,000
They don't know

579
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,950
who wrote the book, right?

580
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,230
Do be relieved.

581
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,160
They've no idea that you wrote it.

582
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,640
I've told you so many times.

583
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,070
I really didn't write it!

584
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,520
It was written by a Mr. Cao.

585
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,830
Brother, no need to hide from me.

586
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,310
I've written to grandma.

587
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,280
She said

588
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,560
there's no Mr. Cao

589
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,760
in Danzhou.

590
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,040
I know

591
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,830
you're afraid that popularity

592
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,830
might cause jealousy.

593
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,350
Rest assured!

594
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,230
Your secret is safe with me!

595
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,710
No one will know

596
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,360
you're the greatest literary giant

597
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,280
in the world.

598
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,320
I'd better drink some tea.

599
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,000
That's what happened today.

600
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,080
His Majesty didn't speak to Fan Xian?

601
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,560
No.

602
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,520
And he killed all the maidservants
who tried to stop the carriage?

603
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,800
Exactly.

604
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,950
That's why you're here

605
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,840
ripping paintings?

606
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,320
From today on,

607
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,120
I won't have personal relationship

608
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,870
with Your Highness any more.

609
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,870
I have to say something

610
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,870
from my heart.

611
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,910
Your Highness, I beg your pardon!

612
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,000
Go ahead!

613
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,520
Your Highness, you're the
Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace.

614
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,150
It's understandable that

615
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,470
you have to associate with civil and military officials.

616
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,360
But I'm in charge of the imperial palace

617
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,190
and I have to guard beside His Majesty.

618
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,430
If I develop a deep

619
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,870
personal relationship with you,

620
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:14,470
can His Majesty feel relieved?

621
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,600
Go on!

622
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,710
Fan Xian from Danzhou is of low birth.

623
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
His Majesty didn't go out secretly

624
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,630
to see him.

625
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,800
Today, His Majesty

626
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,870
also said the following words.

627
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,520
The worship ritual went on smoothly today.

628
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,560
You've done well.

629
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,080
I didn't realize what he meant at that time.

630
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,800
Later after careful consideration, I felt so frightened.

631
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,760
His Majesty knew that

632
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,430
I was deeply associated with Your Highness.

633
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,360
Yet, he put me

634
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,120
in charge of safety

635
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,430
for this secret trip out.

636
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,280
He certainly didn't come out

637
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,630
to see Fan Xian,

638
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
but to see

639
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,910
whether I'll stop Fan Xian

640
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,040
or not.

641
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,910
As an imperial guard,

642
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,710
I take orders directly from His Majesty.

643
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,360
My duty

644
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,470
requires me to associate with

645
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,600
no officials.

646
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,950
As an official,

647
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,560
I should be diligent in my work

648
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,520
and introspect myself often.

649
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,040
It's not easy for you to give such sincere advice.

650
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,280
Others might not dare to

651
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,320
say those words.

652
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,910
I've committed a deadly sin.

653
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,800
What happened to Fan Xian today

654
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,870
was not my planning.

655
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
Fine! Fine!

656
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,630
As for this painting,

657
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,950
I'll take it back.

658
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,360
From now on,

659
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,800
we should carry out our own duties.

660
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,280
No need to meet in private.

661
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,950
Your Highness, thanks for your understanding.

662
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,190
I'll excuse myself.

663
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,120
It reads the date of your return.

664
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,760
Who gave it to you?

665
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,950
I don't know.

666
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,950
It appeared on my desk last night.

667
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,870
So today,

668
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,150
I rushed back specially

669
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,150
for fear that Fan Sizhe might offend you.

670
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,760
He's really scared of you.

671
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,230
He's very mischievous.

672
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,360
Father always asks me to restrain him.

673
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,760
He's scared of me

674
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,710
from the bottom of his heart

675
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,870
since childhood.

676
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,870
His mother let you do that?

677
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,360
Normally, Liu Ruyu dares not mess up with me.

678
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,430
Really tough!

679
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,670
Have you figured it out?

680
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,470
How come Fan Ruoruo is back?

681
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,670
We specially calculated the date

682
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,630
to send her away.

683
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,710
I've asked them.

684
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,630
They said Lady Ruoruo

685
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,430
got rid of them

686
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,760
not long after leaving home,

687
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
and she went back on her own.

688
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,120
It seems that

689
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,000
she's long known

690
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,560
the accurate arrival time of Fan Xian.

691
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,320
Who told her?

692
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,230
I've checked everyone, but no one has ever told her.

693
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,190
Then how could she know?

694
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,520
Mom!

695
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,320
When can I leave?

696
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,000
Fan Ruoruo alone

697
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,320
is already hard to deal with.

698
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,000
It appears that Fan Xian is also cunning.

699
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
Can't you focus here?

700
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,150
There's nothing to be focused on!

701
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,430
He's just

702
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,600
a bastard son from Danzhou.

703
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,630
If he behaves improperly,

704
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,950
a good beating will do him good.

705
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,800
We can't beat him at home.

706
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Well,

707
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,230
I'll ask him out for lunch tomorrow.

708
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,280
Then I'll beat him up on the street.

709
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,150
How do you like that?

710
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,670
Breaking tricks with pure force.

711
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,000
That's sort of a plan.

712
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,230
Mom!

713
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,910
To trick him out for lunch,

714
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,870
I'll need money for support.

715
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Support! Support!

716
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,000
Fan Ruoruo...

717
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,230
When I was young, she beat about the bush

718
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,190
and tried to suppress me with schemes.

719
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,280
Luckily, you wrote to me

720
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,360
and taught me how to deal with her.

721
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,230
Over these years,

722
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,630
she know that I'm shrewd and deep,

723
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,150
so she stops picking fights with me.

724
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,840
However,

725
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,320
I can't figure out

726
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,710
who's been helping me secretly.

727
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Uncle Wuzhu must have arrived in the capital city

728
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
earlier than me.

729
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,950
Who's Uncle Wuzhu?

730
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,390
The one who taught me to climb cliffs.

731
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,230
His name

732
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,320
must be kept from others.

733
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,560
So I didn't mention him in the letters.

734
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,600
Then why do you tell me.

735
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,600
You're my younger sister. You're no others.

736
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,320
Is that Uncle Wuzhu trustworthy?

737
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,870
As to him, it's a long story.

738
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,080
My Lady, Master's back.

739
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,910
He asks Young Master Fan Xian to see him in his study.

740
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Keep this for me for a while.

741
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,560
I was wondering

742
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,870
what's the drumstick about.

743
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,710
I'll tell you everything later.

744
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,870
Master wants to see Fan Xian right when he's back?

745
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,630
Yes, Madam.

746
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,630
It's no big deal.

747
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,360
Keep watching.

748
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,600
Yes.

749
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,710
Your father's attitude to Fan Xian

750
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,710
is of key importance.

751
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,670
Mom!

752
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,870
What attitude?

753
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,120
He left Fan Xian in Danzhou

754
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,000
for so many years.

755
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,710
Did he ever go back to visit him?

756
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,430
That's the weirdest part.

757
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,840
Your father is not a cold man.

758
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,520
If he visited Fan Xian

759
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,760
in Danzhou occasionally,

760
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,230
I wouldn't be so nervous.

761
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,280
But he just left him there

762
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,710
and ignored him.

763
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,360
It doesn't make sense.

764
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,230
So I sent someone

765
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,520
to watch Fan Xian in Danzhou.

766
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,800
I just want to know

767
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,870
whether he contacted Fan Xian secretly or not.

768
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,710
I find it weird

769
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,390
all the time.

770
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,190
I can't protect you

771
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,630
for a lifetime.

772
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,710
You have to rely on yourself eventually.

773
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,710
As to your future, I...

774
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,950
Money! How much will you give me?

775
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,630
Not a dime!

776
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,150
No money! Then I can't beat him.

777
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,000
I can't! I can't!

778
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,560
Master said you could go in

779
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,910
without reporting.

780
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,020
In the river of history,

781
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,220
time goes round and round.

782
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Memories about the former and present lives

783
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,460
join each other in an endless way.

784
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,060
In the long drunken Milky Way,

785
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,780
one season follows another in a flash,

786
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,980
and the wild geese are flying south.

787
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,900
I just can't give up

788
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,900
to be with you for my whole life.

789
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,180
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

790
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,980
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

791
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,860
Year after year in the wandering,

792
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,420
I count the remaining years.

793
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,620
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

794
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,180
even though we have ended up the destiny,

795
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,860
I never feel regretful.

796
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,820
In such a chaotic world,

797
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,580
I still miss you as ever.

798
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,220
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

799
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,940
With a gentle heart,

800
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,500
I cherish our remaining years.

801
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,340
Even though we have to go through

802
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,300
all the hardships along the journey,

803
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:06,620
you always stay by my side,

804
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,380
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

805
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,300
Year after year in the wandering,

806
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,660
I count the remaining years.

807
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,020
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

808
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,820
even though we end up the destiny,

809
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,260
I never feel regretful.

810
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,180
In such a chaotic world,

811
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,140
I still miss you as ever.

812
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,820
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

813
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,580
With a gentle heart,

814
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,980
I cherish our remaining years.

815
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,780
Even though we have to go through

816
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,940
all the hardships along the journey,

817
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:47,220
you always stay by my side...
