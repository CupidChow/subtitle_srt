17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,300
Prime Minister Lin, what do you mean by doing this?

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,800
If I keep thinking of him,

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,000
how can I focus on supporting you in the future?

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,500
After what's happened,

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,200
you need to be careful of the Eastern Palace.

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
You believe that the crown prince will harm me?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
There are two reasons.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,100
1. You are going to take the Inside Treasury

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,600
from the hands of Li Yunrui.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,210
Princess Royal is also Wan'er's mother.

27
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,600
I don't have any intention of disrespecting her.

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,400
2. After you came to the capital,

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,200
you stood on the side of Second Prince. Of course, the crown prince isn't happy.

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,600
I've only met Second Prince a few times. I've not chosen sides.

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
Then, you shouldn't have met him.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,600
The waters run deep in the capital. If you don't want to choose a side for protection,

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,400
you'll only bring disaster upon your own head.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Then, what should I do?

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,800
From now on, don't take sides.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Do your best not to meet with the two of them.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,000
But didn't you just say I should choose a side for myself?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,200
Since you're the son-in-law of my house,

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,000
of course, you should come and stand with me.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
But if the crown prince sees me as the enemy.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Wouldn't it bring harm to the Lin family after he becomes emperor?

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,800
I will do my best to calm the waters.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
If the crown prince still sees you as the enemy,

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,000
then this position as the heir

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,700
can go to someone else.

46
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,240
So if the water is shallow, then it won't be blue...

47
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,580
But I've never seen the ocean.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,230
I'll bring you next time.

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,800
Big Brother, you're done talking?

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Dabao, I'm going to marry your sister.

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
So you're the big brother.

52
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,200
You're going to marry Wan'er?

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Wan'er is great! She never scolds me.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Also, she... she... gives me cookies.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
Next time, I'll give you cookies, too.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
Really?!

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
- Then... will you take me to see the ocean?
- Yes.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
Then... Then... we must bring Wan'er, too. Let's go!

59
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Hello, Mr. Yuan!

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Let's go! Let's go!

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't worry, I'll not leave Wan'er wherever I go.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
That's good.

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
What about Erbao?

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,400
Do we want to bring Lin Gong with us?

65
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,350
Dabao...

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,400
Lin Gong... he's gone to a faraway place.

67
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,400
We might not be able to see him for a long time.

68
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,370
Is Lin Gong dead?

69
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:18,000
I used to have a pet cat, a pet rabbit...

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and then they all disappeared.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,400
And so I went looking for them.

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,200
I looked and looked and looked,

73
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,000
but I couldn't find them.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,600
And then a servant girl told me that they'd died.

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,200
I asked Wan'er what death was.

76
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Wan'er said,

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,200
"Dying means that one has gone somewhere far, far away.

78
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,200
We won't be able to see them for a long, long time.

79
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,100
And then, one day, I'll go there, too.

80
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,700
Then we'll be able to meet again."

81
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,400
So, in the future,

82
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll go to that faraway place.

83
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,400
I'll go see my cat,

84
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,880
my rabbit, and Lin Gong.

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
When I see them again,

86
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I-I'll tell them that I haven't seen them in a long time.

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,000
And that I missed them.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,600
Good. Just say that.

89
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Wan'er likes patting my head, too.

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
It feels so nice.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,400
Big Brother, you two are really alike.

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Dabao... I've told you, you're the big brother.

93
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Be good. Don't call me that next time.

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
What? You're younger than me?

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm younger than you. Call me Fan Xian.

96
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Fan...

97
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,200
Then, how about I call you Little Xian Xian?

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Dabao... this nickname... it's pretty gross.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
Little Xian Xian?

100
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't call me that.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
- Little Xian Xian!
- Don't call me that!

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Little Xian Xian! Little Xian Xian! Little Xian Xian!

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,800
The message has been sent to the crown prince.

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,300
He didn't say much.

105
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
As long as he knows.

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,700
Sir, have you so quickly decided

107
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,300
to hand Wan'er and the future of the Lin family to Fan Xian?

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,600
Just now,

109
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I saw Fan Xian and Dabao together.

110
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I saw them, too.

111
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Actually, even the servants in our household...

112
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
when they see Dabao,

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,000
there's this lack of respect in their eyes.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,800
I know that most of them look down on him.

115
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
They don't have the patience to talk to him.

116
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
But when Fan Xian is with him,

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,400
his smile is sincere and comes from the heart.

118
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
That's true.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Fan Xian really does seem to treat Dabao like a friend.

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,800
In that moment, I decided.

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,200
If he isn't involved in Gong'er's death,

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,900
then the Lin family will choose him to be its future guardian.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
All right, there's no need to accompany me any further.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,200
Go back. I'll come back another day.

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,600
You're not someone Father summoned over.

126
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
The people that Father summons don't like to play with me.

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
They only smile at me when Father is around.

129
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,600
When he isn't, they ignore me.

130
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,000
Have you told your father this before?

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,900
No. I can't tell.

132
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,200
Let me tell you... You can't tell him.

133
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
If you tell them, Father will scold them

134
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
and they'll be very sad.

135
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,700
Dabao, do you know how long I've been in the capital?

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
I don't know.

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,400
I came from Danzhou to the capital,

138
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,000
and I've met many people and encountered many issues.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But I think you're more lovable than most of them.

140
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
Danzhou...

141
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Then, you're saying that I'm good?

142
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Yup. You're good.

143
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Little Xian Xian, then you have to remember to come and play with me often!

144
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I told you not to...

145
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Okay, I promise you.

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Then you'd better head home.

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Otherwise, your father will scold you, too.

148
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm off.

149
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
Remember not to eat rubbish on the way home!

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I got it.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,800
Don't step into puddles! Don't steal other people's candy!

152
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,900
Got it!

153
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,700
And... remember to dress well when you leave the house!

154
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,000
Got it!

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Remember to use chopsticks when you eat, not your hands!

156
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Got it!

157
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,600
Sir...

158
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,000
How is it you again?

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
If not me, then who?

160
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,400
Didn't you tell me to send Miss to the Eastern Palace?

161
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
But the crown prince didn't come to the Lin house to cut me off.

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's right. Miss sat in there for a long time before coming out.

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
I was waiting there the whole time.

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,800
Miss said that the chariot was too slow, so she wanted me to rush over to find you first.

165
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Find me for what?

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
The crown prince has left the palace.

167
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Do you need to tell me even if he goes to the toilet?

168
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Don't joke around, Sir. Not that kind of leaving the palace.

169
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Fine, fine! I won't joke.

170
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
I won't joke. Where is he going?

171
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,400
The Inspection and Control Bureau.

172
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,790
Why is he going there for?

173
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Miss said that the crown prince wants to see Si Lili.

174
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,000
<i>His Highness wants to visit Si Lili at the Investigation and Control Bureau?</i>

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,400
<i>Yes. Miss Ruoruo doesn't need to go with me.</i>

176
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,600
<i>Your Highness doesn't believe what Mr. Yuan said?</i>

177
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
<i>I don't believe what Si Lili said.</i>

178
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
<i>Hence, you are going to interrogate her?</i>

179
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,100
<i>On the contrary, I'm going to rescue her.</i>

180
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,600
He's going to rescue Si Lili?

181
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,400
Mistress asked the crown prince the reason for his action.

182
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,800
Crown Prince said, since Si Lili was interrogated by you alone,

183
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,400
there's also a possibility that you already know about Lin Gong.

184
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,400
But you told Si Lili not to tell anyone else.

185
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,800
<i>Why would Si Lili listen to my older brother?</i>

186
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,600
<i>She still hid the truth despite the torture?</i>

187
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
<i>Because Fan Xian will use her life in exchange</i>

188
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,000
<i>to make her keep the secret.</i>

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,670
<i>Tell me the name. I will protect your life.</i>

190
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,700
Mistress asked me, according to what the crown prince said,

191
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,000
if you have already agreed with Si Lili to protect her life?

192
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,000
<i>I want you to trust me.</i>

193
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,200
<i>In this city, the person who can protect you,</i>

194
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,400
<i>is only me.</i>

195
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,800
<i>Fine.</i>

196
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Lord?

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What else did the crown prince say?

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,400
He said he will use his position as the crown prince to swear that,

199
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
or Si Lili tells the truth about the night interrogation,

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,000
he will rescue Si Lili from the dungeon and ensure her safety.

201
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Let's go to the Inspection and Control Bureau.

202
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Lord, there's no need to panic.

203
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Perhaps, Miss Si Lili has a deep affection for you

204
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
and she won't reveal anything.

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,500
There's only one reason why Si Lili is not telling the truth until now.

206
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,800
That's because she knows the Bureau values me highly.

207
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,600
As long as she is locked up in there, she won't talk.

208
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,800
If she knows the crown prince will rescue her,

209
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
she will definitely betray me.

210
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
As long as Si Lili reveals the truth,

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,400
the crown prince, the prime minister, and the rest of the officials

212
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,600
will presume that I killed Lin Gong.

213
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,390
It's too late.

214
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,800
Lord, think of a way to stop the crown prince.

215
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,700
If I show up at this time, it will mean I admitted to this.

216
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,000
There is another way. I will delay the crown prince.

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Lord, go into the prison and kill Si Lili now.

218
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
I promised her that I wouldn't kill her.

219
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Look at the situation now.

220
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
If she doesn't die, you are doomed.

221
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
It's useless talking about this again.

222
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,300
If Si Lili is killed now, they will also say I silenced her.

223
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,600
We can say the spies of Northern Qi did it.

224
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,400
Why do you think the crown prince told Ruoruo that he's coming here?

225
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,070
Why?

226
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,400
The crown prince has never trusted Ruoruo.

227
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
He told her this

228
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
to let me hear it

229
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,400
for me to react.

230
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
We can't go forward or retreat either.

231
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,600
Our only hope now is to stop him,

232
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,200
to prevent him from entering the Bureau; or else, there's no way out for me.

233
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,800
But the crown prince is so powerful.

234
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
That's right. There's still hope.

235
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
His Majesty issued a royal decree that

236
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,000
all the princes are not allowed to contact the Bureau and meddle in their affairs.

237
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,400
Moreover, the officials there won't allow him to enter, either.

238
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,370
But I hope so.

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,020
They are here.

240
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,250
Line up!

241
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,640
Lord Zhu, please make way.

242
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,560
His Majesty already said that

243
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,480
the princes are not allowed to enter.

244
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,540
You want to stop me?

245
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,220
He wants to stop me?

246
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,600
I wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare stand in the way of a royal order.

247
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,200
Good.

248
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,000
From this moment, I am going to walk into the Bureau.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,800
Unless you stop me with force, I won't stop.

250
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Your Highness, if you do this, His Majesty will be furious.

251
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,740
Do you dare to take action?

252
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,800
The Inspection and Control Bureau is an important institution of the country and the court.

253
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
If Your Highness takes any steps further, I will draw my sword.

254
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,000
I merely dare not defy His Majesty's decree. I have no choice.

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,200
I will knock the crown prince unconscious and send him to the emperor for punishment.

256
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,000
I get it now.

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Do you think you can single-handedly

258
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,200
stop my guards?

259
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,080
Draw your swords!

260
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,600
Your Highness, this is the capital. How are you going to explain this to the emperor?

261
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,400
Lin Gong was a good friend of mine.

262
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Based on our relationship, or based on the law, I have to get to the bottom of this!

263
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,800
The Inspection and Control Bureau will investigate.

264
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't trust you! Get out of the way!

265
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,600
The crown prince is being so stubborn.

266
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,000
This is bad.

267
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
Yan and Zhu are still blocking his way.

268
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
They won't be able to stop him. I underestimated the crown prince.

269
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,800
Now that things have come to this, our plans in the capital have come to naught.

270
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,200
Wang Qinian, I'll come up with a plan to get out of the capital.

271
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,400
You just pretend you don't know anything. I don't think they'll make things difficult for you.

272
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,200
Sir.

273
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,400
This is farewell, Wang Qinian.

274
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Sir!

275
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,800
- <i>Get out of the way!</i>
- Listen.

276
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
What's that sound?

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Charge!

278
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,000
The Black Guards?

279
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,700
Put down your weapons!

280
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,000
Chief.

281
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
What's wrong?

282
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Just a little cold.

283
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I'll get a doctor right now.

284
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,700
Don't bother.

285
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,300
<i>[Chen Pingping: head of the Inspection and Control Bureau]</i>

286
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,100
What's wrong with his legs?

287
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,400
Years ago, Chen Pingping led the Black Guards

288
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,400
to ride thousands of <i>li</i> to capture Northern Qi's best fighter, Xiao En.

289
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,400
He was injured in that battle and has never been able to walk again.

290
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,300
Please return, Your Highness.

291
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,210
Get out of the way!

292
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Chen Pingping, you think you're so powerful!

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,700
Some say that you only answer to the emperor, and are above everyone else in this capital.

294
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,240
Your Highness is mistaken.

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I heard that the Black Guards under your command

296
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
are unrivaled in battle and ruthless in killing!

297
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,800
Are the Black Guards brave enough to kill the heir to the throne?

298
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,700
Or are you going to take action yourself?

299
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,400
It's not the way of a good subject to use force against the heir.

300
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,700
Then, you can't stop me!

301
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,600
Get out of the way!

302
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
Since he's being so hard-nosed about it...

303
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,100
What are you doing?

304
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,700
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

305
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Protect the heir!

306
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,600
Get out of the way! Chen Pingping, let me go! Chen Pingping!

307
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Get out of the way! Chen Pingping, let me go! Chen Pingping!

308
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Chen Pingping!

309
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Protecting the heir when an assassin is about is the way of a good subject.

310
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Shadow.

311
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,500
The head of the Bureau wants to see you.

312
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,430
Nowadays, I have been thinking.

313
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,270
When Si Lili was pursued outside Jingdu, why did the Black Knights arrive in time?

314
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,090
How did they know my movements?

315
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,650
After the battle today, I finally understood.

316
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,850
It was definitely the head who wanted me to be by your side.

317
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,470
You were also the one who notified the Black Knights, right?

318
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,320
That dog and I...

319
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,450
are the closest to the head.

320
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,110
Leave. I want to talk to him.

321
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,750
Yes.

322
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,860
What a great head of the Inspection and Control Bureau.

323
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,970
A schemer and a strategist. You are extremely brilliant.

324
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,290
Push me in there.

325
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,100
Why are you looking at me? Are there flowers on my face?

326
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,960
Come nearer.

327
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,190
You are dressed too thinly. Be careful you don't catch a cold.

328
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,400
Your eyes are similar to hers.

329
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,190
When she was standing here, I asked her

330
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,330
what kind of flowers we should plant when the Inspection and Control Bureau was established.

331
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,250
As long as she opened her mouth,

332
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,470
even if it was the most expensive flower, I would find it.

333
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,320
She took a seed from a wildflower from the side of the road,

334
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,980
and just casually placed it next to the wall.

335
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,700
No need to plant.

336
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,020
Life itself can lead one to the path to success.

337
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,560
Who are you referring to?

338
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,570
Ye Qingmei, your mother.

339
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,160
Who's Ye Qingmei?

340
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,600
Is Wu Zhu in Jingdu?

341
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,120
Who is Wu Zhu, too?

342
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,840
He killed Lin Gong.

343
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,710
They haven't found the real killer of  Second Master.

344
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,230
You don't believe me?

345
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,800
It won't be a problem. I will wind up Lin Gong's case.

346
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,160
<i>[Imperial Study]</i>

347
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,440
- Your Highness! 
- I want to see His Majesty.

348
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,010
Your Highness, why do you want to see His Majesty?

349
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,040
The crown prince requests to see you.

350
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,660
The crown prince said regarding the second master of the prime minister,

351
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,830
he has a speculation on the real killer of Lin Gong.

352
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,530
Who did he speculate?

353
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,590
I dare not say.

354
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,840
I'm not even telling you to speculate.

355
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
Speak.

356
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:46,000
The crown prince said... second prince may be the real killer.

357
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,140
Lord Wang, why are you sitting here?

358
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,990
Lord, don't ever call me that.

359
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,320
You are the trusted aide and directly under the command of Head Chen Pingping of the Bureau.

360
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,080
Please take extra good care of the Investigation and Control Bureau in the future.

361
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,770
Lord, don't ever say this.

362
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,940
Frankly, he's just a business transaction.

363
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,290
What do you mean?

364
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,930
Lord.

365
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,460
Lord. Lord!

366
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,800
Initially,

367
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,190
I wanted to leave the Inspection and Control Bureau

368
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,570
but Head Chen brought up a condition.

369
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,410
He said before he returned to Jingdu, he wanted me to be with you at all times.

370
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,230
From the start, I didn't want to agree to this

371
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:53,010
but when you returned to Jingdu; I saw you from the hole at the city gate.

372
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,090
I then observed you for several days.

373
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,170
I realized that you are not only bright and heroic,

374
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,420
moreover, your speech and behavior are also noble and pure. I was full of admiration.

375
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,940
That's why I decided to be your partner

376
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,730
and willingly work for you.

377
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,540
Be honest.

378
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,850
Lord, you are generous. It made me respect and admire you.

379
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,630
Why did you want to leave the Inspection and Control Bureau?

380
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,550
For the past few years, the Bureau

381
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,500
was definitely established to be brilliant in military success,

382
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,480
to rectify the administration of the local officials.

383
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,400
If I remain there, I would have a good prospect.

384
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,850
But, frankly, I already didn't have

385
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,060
this ambition and had no plans to rise in ranks.

386
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,270
Talking about this, perhaps, it's because I have grown soft-hearted.

387
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,460
I couldn't stand to see some of the punishments in the Bureau which were extremely harsh.

388
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,860
Chen Pingping's idea?

389
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,600
How can it be the head's idea? He personally said

390
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,150
these kind of brutal deeds are passable for the enemies.

391
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,910
They shouldn't be used on our own people.

392
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,940
What he said didn't work?

393
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,530
Lord, you may not know.

394
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:12,000
There are now more and more people who will die for the Qing state.

395
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,350
In their eyes, they don't think these kinds of loyalties are wrong and negligent.

396
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,900
It's causing their tactics to be more ruthless.

397
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,700
It's just that the head didn't dare to say that this kind of loyalty was wrong.

398
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,160
As for me, I was born to be lazy.

399
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,360
I can't integrate with this kind of era and catch up with their pace.

400
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,770
Hence, I wanted to leave the Bureau.

401
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,200
Where do you plan to go next?

402
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,160
Where else can I go?

403
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,460
Of course, I'm following you.

404
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,210
I understand! I understand! I definitely deceived you.

405
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,630
Can I apologize for the offense?

406
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,790
How will you do that?

407
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,590
Lord, please wait.

408
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,290
What are you doing?

409
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,650
Lord, it's my treat. I will pay.

410
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,310
Let's be extravagant.

411
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,630
<i>[Noodles]</i>

412
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,190
Please wait. I don't have enough money.

413
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,190
I will pay you for half a bowl of noodles and you let me have two bowls. Okay?

414
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,660
No way.

415
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,980
Don't be hasty. For this bowl of noodles,

416
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,360
add meat in it. The other bowl, you can just add some soup.

417
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,000
Will this do?

418
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,080
Okay then.

419
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,960
You are good at doing business.

420
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,450
Lord. Here.

421
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,430
Come, don't think that these noodles are small.

422
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,530
This is the wonderful flavor of Jingdu.

423
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,320
Please eat. I already paid for this.

424
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,920
These two bowls of noodles are different.

425
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,010
That's right. The main point for these noodles is the soup.

426
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,320
It's simple and brings out its real flavor.

427
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,200
As for this redundant stuff, I ate them for you.

428
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,330
Come, eat it while it's hot.

429
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,200
This redundant stuff...

430
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,210
This Chen Pingping is a demon star who came to Earth.

431
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,130
Very unique from birth.

432
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,480
Normal people like us have two eyes.

433
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,040
As for the pair of eyes of this Chen Pingping,

434
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,240
he was also born with an additional three eyes, too.

435
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,750
Normal people have two arms.

436
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,990
The body of Chen Pingping has an additional two arms, too.

437
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,960
His hands hold a sharp weapon and he's majestic looking.

438
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,570
Five eyes?

439
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,500
- Four arms? 
- That's right.

440
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,640
Lord Chen's height is above ten feet.

441
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,050
His face was like a door plank, fists were like hammers.

442
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,610
A big, fierce, bloody looking mouth.

443
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,500
As long as he aims at the city gate and shouts,

444
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,070
the sky will immediately roll with thunder

445
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,030
as powerful as a thunderbolt.

446
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:28,130
Every night, Chen Pingping must be at the Northern Qi's camp

447
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,850
to eat less than ten of Northern Qi's soldiers.

448
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,390
Those barbarian thieves of Northern Qi are already used to this.

449
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,110
Every night, they will draw lots to decide and wait to be eaten by Lord Chen.

450
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,130
Everyone, this is indeed the Chen Pingping that chases stars and pursues moons,

451
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,670
the who hunts in the mountains and seas!

452
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,010
<i>[An Qing Gate]</i>

453
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,080
So how are they, Lord?

454
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,640
They aren't bad.

455
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,500
Let's call it even then.

456
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,200
I will think about it.

457
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,870
Let me get you more soup then.

458
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,170
No need for that.

459
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,530
Young Master.

460
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,460
Why are you still eating here?

461
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,720
What are you doing here?

462
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,490
I just came back from hearing stories at the teahouse.

463
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,400
Why?

464
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,460
Our bookstore is going to open soon. Why aren't you serious?

465
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,770
If we listen to more of these, we can learn more.

466
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,070
I heard a new story. Chen Pingping

467
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:38,060
rode alone for a thousand miles to Northern Qi. It's very exciting.

468
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,790
If you write about him, the book will definitely sell like hotcakes.

469
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,160
Chen Pingping? He even traveled for a thousand miles?

470
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,070
Eunuch Hou.

471
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,080
Fan Xian, the emperor has summoned you with no delay.

472
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,780
But I haven't finished my noodles.

473
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,090
Please don't delay. We're just waiting on you.

474
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,690
How did you find me?

475
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,350
You weren't at home. So I went to the Inspection and Control Bureau. Chief Chen told me.

476
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,410
Cheng Pingping.

477
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,330
If you're looking for someone, the Inspection and Control Bureau

478
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,290
is the one place that's really omniscient.

479
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:26,590
He must have sent someone to follow me to know my movements so quickly.

480
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,880
Master Fan... it's not for us to wonder about

481
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,510
the things that Chief Chen does.

482
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,760
Master, actually, it was your older brother who said he would treat me to a meal.

483
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,830
But now he's gone and he hasn't paid the bill.

484
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,780
Why don't you give me the money?

485
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,340
I'll get the bill.

486
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,100
How much?

487
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,410
- Three <i>liang</i> of silver.
 - Three <i>liang</i> of silver?!

488
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,120
That's right. That's cheap.

489
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,270
Just for these two bowls of noodles?

490
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,500
There isn't even meat.

491
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,810
This profit margin is too good, even better than opening a bookstore!

492
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:10,130
What about this? Tomorrow, I'll buy over this stall. You can cover the meal for today.

493
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,440
This is great, I'm going to be rich!

494
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,110
He won't even give me a single cent?

495
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,080
Please wait a moment, Master Fan.

496
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,400
I'll go and announce you.

497
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,250
I could tell it was you from a distance.

498
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,390
It's fine if you call me "Uncle."

499
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,600
Uncle, you're here, too?

500
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,150
The Emperor summoned me, saying it has to do with Gong'er's death.

501
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,480
Such a big matter will be discussed in the study?

502
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,100
If we discuss this in court, there'll be less room to maneuver.

503
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,760
Prime Minister Lin Master Fan. This way, please.

504
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,270
Don't be afraid. Just follow me.

505
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,950
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Lin and Fan Xian are here.

506
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,560
Come in.

507
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,490
Your Majesty.

508
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,370
Everyone's here.

509
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,070
Now, you should all make yourselves clear in person.

510
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:18,230
Give Prime Minister Lin a seat and some tea.

511
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,400
Thank you, Your Majesty

512
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,460
Your Majesty... what about me?

513
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,030
You? You can just stand there.

514
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,840
Crown Prince, you don't have to be too polite.

515
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,810
The Inspection and Control Bureau has seen the body.

516
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:45,130
Lin Gong died by the hand of a skilled swordsman.

517
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,680
Of all the swordsmen in the capital, only Xie Bi'an, who works for my brother, has this level of skill.

518
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,030
So the crown prince means...

519
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,110
The crown prince means that I'm the one who killed Lin Gong.

520
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,670
Your Highness, are you the killer?

521
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,950
You have to ask Fan Xian about this.

522
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,980
Second Prince, what does this have to do with me?

523
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,230
At the time of Lin Gong's killing, I met Fan Xian by chance in the street and had a chat.

524
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,820
Xie Bi'an was by my side then.

525
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,100
I asked for you to be here so you can be a witness.

526
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,870
<i>Xie Bi'an has a sword called, "Breaking Light."</i>

527
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,660
<i>Of all the swordsmen in the capital, there isn't anyone else with this skill.</i>

528
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,350
<i>- A sword called, "Breaking Light?" 
- It's a fast sword.</i>

529
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,060
Is this true?

530
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,730
Yes.

531
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,330
The Inspection and Control Bureau has already verified it.

532
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,720
Considering the time that Lin Gong died,

533
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,490
it's not possible for Xie Bi'an to have left the capital to do the deed.

534
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,500
There's another possibility!

535
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,320
Fan Xian cooperated with you and Xie Bi'an to kill Lin Gong.

536
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,500
And right now, the two of you are making up stories to clear your names!

537
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,640
That's ridiculous!

538
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,440
Why would I want to kill Lin Gong?

539
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,450
Why would Fan Xian want to kill Lin Gong?

540
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,960
Lin Gong was the one who planned the assassination on Cow Pen Street!

541
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,500
Fan Xian has a grudge against him!

542
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,860
Hey, Crown Prince, I didn't know about this!

543
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,570
If the crown prince insists that we're guilty, what's the point of us claiming innocence?

544
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,050
You should explain to me...

545
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,470
If it wasn't Xie Bi'an, who could have had such skill with a sword?

546
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,490
It isn't that hard to hire a highly-skilled swordsman without anyone knowing!

547
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,880
Who are you hinting at?!

548
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,630
- I'm just being logical.
- You're too noisy!

549
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:27,190
Prime Minister Lin, you're the victim. How do you want to deal with this?

550
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,660
From my point of view...

551
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,300
the one who should be blamed...

552
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,210
should be Chen Pingping!

553
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,690
The Inspection and Control Bureau is in charge of watching over the capital

554
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:54,260
and the real culprit behind my son's murder still hasn't been reported.

555
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:00,400
It seems like Chen Pingping hasn't been taking his work seriously.

556
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,000
That makes sense.

557
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,000
I would like to request the opportunity to question Chen Pingping

558
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,850
and demand accountability.

559
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,320
You're pretty comfortable standing there.

560
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,260
Your Majesty, do I have to kneel?

561
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,500
Get up.

562
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,080
Give my order. Have Chen Pingping come to the palace.

563
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,750
Understood.

564
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,370
Chen Pingping!

565
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,700
- Your Majesty.
- Do you know what you've done?

566
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,920
What have I done?

567
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,420
The Prime Minister's son has been killed. As the head of the Inspection and Control Bureau,

568
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,610
you still haven't found the killer. How do you answer?

569
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:28,700
Your Majesty, the murderer has been identified.

570
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,080
You've found the murderer?

571
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,250
Good. In front of Prime Minister Lin and everyone else,

572
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,140
tell us who the murderer is.

573
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,970
Prime Minister Lin...

574
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,910
I heard the terrible news upon returning to the capital.

575
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,970
Please contain your grief.

576
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,140
Who is the murderer?

577
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,470
Si Gujian of East Yi City.

578
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,800
A grandmaster?

579
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,420
If it wasn't a grandmaster, how would the murderer have such skill with the sword?

580
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,830
A grandmaster traveling such a long distance to come to the capital

581
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,280
just to kill Prime Minister Lin's son?

582
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,090
Surely there must be a reason for it.

583
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,600
Lin Gong plotted with Si Lili

584
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,820
to assassinate Fan Xian on Cow Pen Street.

585
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,200
Si Gujian's disciples were killed in that incident.

586
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,290
Those two female assassins were killed by Fan Xian.

587
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,280
Why would Si Gujian seek revenge upon Lin Gong?

588
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,800
Everyone knows that Si Gujian is obsessed with swordplay.

589
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,070
In the assassination attempt, Fan Xian fairly killed the two attackers.

590
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,570
He will only respect Fan Xian

591
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,190
for having the skills.

592
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:52,990
But the ones plotting in the background: Lin Gong and Northern Qi...

593
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,380
those are the ones he sought revenge against.
