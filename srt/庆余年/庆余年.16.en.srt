1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 16

16
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,630
Who is the lady?

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,870
She checked in this afternoon as well!

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,630
She insisted on checking out

19
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,510
the quality of the food here

20
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,360
before she decided whether to eat here or not.

21
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,830
So I brought your food box

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,160
to her to have a look.

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,550
I did nothing else.

24
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,440
Why did you pick ours in particular?

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,270
Because you live close!

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Just the opposite side.

27
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,590
He is alive again!

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,670
Your Excellency,

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,470
there is no trace left at all.

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,000
I just asked the waiter.

31
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,880
The lady has gone.

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,470
Is she Si Lili?

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,550
Not sure!

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,110
It is she without doubt.

35
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,750
What's your source of judgement?

36
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,440
The smell of the Chenguang.

37
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,110
What is that?

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
A type of incense

39
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,110
that has been used by the Joy Tsin House all the time.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,830
Its smell is enduring

41
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,360
and doesn't fade easily. Have a try!

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,190
How do you know that?

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,190
It's a technique of hunting

44
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,960
to make judgement according to the fragrance.

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,030
That's the basic of hunting.

46
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,080
I mean how do you know

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,000
what type of incense the Joy Tsin House uses.

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,160
Frankly speaking,

49
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,470
I have also been

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,520
to the Joy Tsin House.

51
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,600
But only to enjoy the singing.

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,800
Nothing else.

53
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,960
Are you able to hold it?

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,550
It's just too expensive there.

55
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,270
I can't afford it,

56
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,110
nor do I have the guts.

57
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,270
Your Excellency,

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,190
it must be held back

59
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,270
from my wife,

60
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,670
or my life will be...

61
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,550
Fine!

62
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,390
Since the incense smell is confirmed,

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,630
it should be Si Lili.

64
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,910
Let's hunt her down tonight.

65
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,520
Maybe, we'll get something.

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,550
Clean your face immediately.

67
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,270
We're doing it now.

68
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,040
That lady rode her own horse

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,200
towards the Pijia Hill.

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,000
There are two ways

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,200
to the Danzhou Harbor.

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,440
One is the Pijia Hill.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,640
Second is the Chaomeng River.

74
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,350
How do you know where she went?

75
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,000
She inquired about the way.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,790
I persuaded her not to travel in the evening

77
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,040
as the Pijia Hill

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,950
is swarmed with robbers,

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,640
but she just didn't listen.

80
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,440
Thank you!

81
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,390
Let's go!

82
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,070
Sure!

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,320
Hold on please!

84
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,790
Soybean, alfalfa, and eggs.

85
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,390
Your Excellency,

86
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,950
what her horse took

87
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,390
was premium forage.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,950
It is all plains and hills

89
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,670
in the Pijia Hill region.

90
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,000
That's very convenient for horses to travel.

91
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,230
If we are to catch up with her,

92
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,920
we'd better take horses as well.

93
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,040
What's up?

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,600
There is fresh horse waste there.

95
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,270
Well, Your Excellency,

96
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,070
this is the premium forage from the inn.

97
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,480
We're on the right track.

98
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,480
Si Lili should be ahead of us.

99
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,790
Wait a minute!

100
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,830
What's up, Your Excellency?

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,350
It makes me feel so awkward

102
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,760
when I saw you

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
eating it just now.

104
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,040
Your Excellency,

105
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,600
I didn't eat it.

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,640
Don't you think it's too smooth?

107
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,880
What is too smooth?

108
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,390
The finding of poison, the finding of Si Lili,

109
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,830
and the tracing of her marks.

110
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,160
Everything happens one after another so smoothly.

111
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,830
Isn't that good?

112
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,440
She detected us first,

113
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,070
right?

114
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,790
Yeah!

115
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,200
So she poisoned us.

116
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:46,920
Why did she

117
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
poison us?

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,200
She...

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,920
Because we're chasing her!

120
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,510
Then why would she leave in advance

121
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,830
before we got poisoned?

122
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,000
It must be her cautiousness in action.

123
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,600
I poisoned Si Lili

124
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,790
the first time I saw her.

125
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
Is that your foible?

126
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
My point is

127
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,640
she knew I'm proficient at pharmacology.

128
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,350
But the poison that she applied

129
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,440
is too mediocre.

130
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,640
Perhaps

131
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,160
she doesn't have any better poison.

132
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,920
If I were she,

133
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,320
I might as well sneak off than using poison.

134
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,480
And

135
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,110
she told her way of escaping

136
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,950
to the waiter.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,670
Isn't that

138
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,550
a bit intentional?

139
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,600
Your Excellency mean

140
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,070
she did it deliberately to create confusion?

141
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,550
Is it possible that

142
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,950
she went to the Pijia Hill

143
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,320
while diverting us to the Chaomeng River?

144
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,270
No, Your Excellency!

145
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,230
I've checked all the forks

146
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,110
on the road.

147
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,270
There is no human trace

148
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,550
to the direction of the Chaomeng River.

149
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,830
And on our way here,

150
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,760
the horse footprints

151
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,390
have been evading from the low-lying muddy grounds.

152
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,200
Evidently,

153
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,160
the horse is manipulated by someone.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,160
I always have the feeling that

155
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,350
she is waiting for our catch-up.

156
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,880
Your Excellency, you are thinking too much.

157
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,070
She is simply too panicked to select her way

158
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,440
which gives her away.

159
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,510
How long will it take before we catch up with her?

160
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,600
Her horse is very tired now.

161
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,600
Tomorrow morning!

162
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,440
We can catch up with her

163
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,070
by tomorrow morning for sure.

164
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,600
Let's continue!

165
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,110
We'll see when we catch her.

166
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,040
Yes, Your Excellency!

167
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,470
Si Lili!

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,520
There you are finally.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,590
I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time.

170
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,350
You are a Beiqi agent?

171
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,200
Yes!

172
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,790
Did you try to assassin me at Niulan Street?

173
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,910
I like you so much.

174
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,280
Why would I kill you?

175
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,670
Let's take our time to discuss it
after we get back to the capital city.

176
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,200
Mr. Fan,

177
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,550
could you let me go?

178
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,350
No!

179
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,840
I was quite scared

180
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,440
to see you in the inn in town.

181
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,440
I was quite careful with my escape,

182
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,550
but you caught up with me any way.

183
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,350
Your technique of hunting

184
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,320
is really spectacular.

185
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,150
Thanks to Wang!

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,350
You're welcome, Your Excellency!

187
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,400
I've long heard that

188
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,520
Miss Lili is elegant and refined.

189
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,640
You're indeed stunning

190
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,200
when seeing in person.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,550
Do you know why I led you here

192
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,550
with the poison?

193
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,080
So it is really intentional.

194
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,440
Because I was worried

195
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,840
no matter how much I ran,

196
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,000
I wouldn't escape.

197
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,400
So you allow yourself

198
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,880
to be seized without any resistance?

199
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,790
If that's the case,

200
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,880
I should give up in the inn.

201
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,960
Why would I run for one extra night?

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Robbers?

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,880
What robbers?

204
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,470
You're indeed smart!

205
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,000
The robbers that hold this place

206
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,440
are also Beiqi agents.

207
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,350
We had the appointment to meet here from the start.

208
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,080
We found only you and Wang Qinian

209
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,550
in the inn.

210
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,080
So, we'd just make full use of the chance

211
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,670
to set up an ambush.

212
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,790
Take care!

213
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,000
Allow me to leave.

214
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,280
Your Excellency!

215
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,880
This is it!

216
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,790
It is a bit longer!

217
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,000
Make do with it.

218
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,440
They are all above Sixth Dan.

219
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,000
It's better for us to find a chance

220
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,350
and submerge into the ground.

221
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,230
Your Excellency,

222
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
it's too early

223
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,350
to kneel down for mercy now!

224
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,080
It's shaking!

225
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,760
What is shaking?

226
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,200
The stones.

227
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,110
Your Excellency, this is not the right time

228
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,550
to bend down and watch the stones.

229
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,320
Your Excellency!

230
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,840
Black knights!

231
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,000
The black knights showed up in the east?

232
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,550
We just got the message.

233
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,030
Isn't the Head back to his hometown?

234
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,790
How come he deployed the black knights?

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Get it investigated.

236
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,790
Yes!

237
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,000
The First Division's role

238
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,670
is to manage the affairs in the capital city.

239
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
You don't need to

240
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,910
care so much about the affairs out of it.

241
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,400
Don't you want to know

242
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,670
why the black knights

243
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,550
were deployed suddenly?

244
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,000
The black knights are a very strong force

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,910
governed by the Head directly.

246
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,590
We have no right

247
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,230
to investigate their whereabouts.

248
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,880
But the Head has gone back to his hometown.

249
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,840
Why were the black knights

250
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
deployed all of a sudden?

251
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,590
It has nothing to do

252
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
with you or me.

253
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,710
Yan Ruohai,

254
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,230
do you know anything secret?

255
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,760
The strongest force

256
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,080
in the Investigator's Office

257
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,320
are the black knights

258
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,000
governed by the Head directly.

259
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,350
It's the strongest cavalry

260
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,200
approved by His Majesty

261
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,550
to protect the Head.

262
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,320
Isn't the Head back to his hometown?

263
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,030
How come the black knights are here?

264
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,030
The black knights' showing up

265
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,790
means the Head is not far either.

266
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't wait to see

267
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
what kind of a person he is

268
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,080
who controls the terrible giant

269
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,840
and beast-like Investigator's Office

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,840
The Head hasn't come.

271
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,440
Master Shadow!

272
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,140
The Head knows all about what happened in the capital city.

273
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,470
=Shadow, Director of the Sixth Division=
The Head knows all about what happened in the capital city.

274
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,590
=Shadow, Director of the Sixth Division
of the Nanqing Investigator's Office=

275
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:12,740
=Shadow, Director of the Sixth Division=
He has a message for you.

276
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,760
He has a message for you.

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,710
Me?

278
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,320
He wants you to act with a free hand.

279
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,110
Even if the sky falls down,

280
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,840
he will push it back.

281
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,640
The Head knows me?

282
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,790
That's all the words he wants to deliver.

283
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,080
When will the Head come back to the capital city?

284
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,880
He will be back

285
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,230
when you need him the most.

286
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,110
In spite that the Sixth Division of
the Investigator's Office takes charge of assassination,

287
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,550
the most terrible assassin

288
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,710
publicly known to everyone

289
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,400
is Master Shadow.

290
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,790
He follows the Head all the year round.

291
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,320
But no one ever knows

292
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,110
what he looks like,

293
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,080
neither does anyone

294
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,710
know his name.

295
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,350
That is to say,

296
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,590
he could be anyone

297
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,470
around us.

298
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,230
Yes!

299
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
A sweeping force of cavalries

300
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,470
turns all the tricks

301
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,670
into a joke.

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,550
That's the strong in real sense.

303
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,150
Who are you?

304
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,280
Why does Chen Pingping

305
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,440
send the black knights for you?

306
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,760
You may not believe it that

307
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,520
it's the first time for me to hear this name.

308
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,910
Chen Pingping is the name of the Head!

309
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,280
It's a taboo to address him by his name directly.

310
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,470
Which Ping is it?

311
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,400
The one in Fuping (duckweeds).

312
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,000
Sounds a bit delicate.

313
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,440
Didn't you say we shouldn't address him by his name?

314
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,320
No, don't do that!

315
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,230
This name used to sweep cross the world

316
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,000
and it is a nightmare to all Kingdoms.

317
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,030
Chen Pingping from the Investigator's Office

318
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,880
is publicly known as King of Nights

319
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,470
and the source of all sins.

320
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,110
Let's discuss it on our way back.

321
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,110
Your Excellency,

322
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,470
we must be careful

323
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,350
on the way back.

324
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,080
What do you mean?

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,350
The Niulan Street assassination

326
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,760
involves masters

327
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,080
from both Beiqi and Dongyi Town

328
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,840
and also the archer of the Capital Garrison.

329
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,670
These cannot be manipulated

330
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
by an agent.

331
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,590
I'm afraid

332
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,640
there is a big figure behind it.

333
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,350
So?

334
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
It's quite complicated

335
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
and we'd better stay covert

336
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,590
on the way.

337
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,590
Don't let anyone know

338
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,680
we have captured her.

339
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
Are you worried that she'll be killed
half way to keep her mouth shut?

340
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,430
Anything can happen

341
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,000
before we get back.

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,950
Black knights sweeping through

343
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,710
is a scene

344
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,310
which can't be hidden.

345
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,680
I'm afraid we'll have to

346
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,040
act the other way around.

347
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,710
The other way around?

348
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,680
What do you mean?

349
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,430
Fan Xian from Danzhou travelled a long way

350
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,920
to capture Si Lili, the Beiqi agent,

351
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
and escort her back to the capital city.

352
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,760
It seems Si Lili

353
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,680
has committed something serious.

354
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,710
It's surprising that she is an agent.

355
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,190
Fan Xian's got a great formation.

356
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,950
Seizure of the Beiqi agent

357
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,400
is something that can be done but cannot be disclosed.

358
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,110
Straightforward as he is,

359
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,190
he is also clever.

360
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,110
The more people know about it,

361
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,920
the safer their way of return will be.

362
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,760
Whoever tries to do something bad to them

363
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,800
reveals the guilt from the heart.

364
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,470
It is so according to logical thinking.

365
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,590
Is there any other possibility?

366
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,000
This is no longer a concern

367
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,190
if one is crazy.

368
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,110
Auntie, what are you laughing at?

369
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,830
My future son-in-law

370
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,680
is indeed funny.

371
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,280
Si Lili is a potato

372
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,350
too hot to hold now.

373
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,590
It's plausibly wise

374
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,400
to return on a large scale.

375
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,920
Shall we just kill him?

376
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,070
Kill him?

377
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,110
He will reach the capital city tomorrow

378
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,310
with his current speed.

379
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,880
If we send killers

380
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,350
to kill him outside of the capital city,

381
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,680
Wan'er doesn't need to marry him.

382
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,760
The power of Neiku doesn't need to be handed over either.

383
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,880
What a perfect chance!

384
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,710
Si Lili is very suspicious

385
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,400
to be Beiqi agent.

386
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,310
If we take action now,

387
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,640
it's very likely that we'll be convicted
of killing to keep her mouth shut.

388
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,040
Isn't that more interesting?

389
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,950
Auntie,

390
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,000
this is really not the right time to kill him.

391
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
Seriously?

392
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,230
If you do that,

393
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,000
I'll be in grave danger.

394
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,830
You see?

395
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm just having a joke with him.

396
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,310
He takes it too seriously.

397
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,350
Wait!

398
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,880
Your Excellency!

399
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,470
This is the third bunch of people

400
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,710
in such a short while.

401
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,310
Let's take a guess

402
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,880
whose side they are from.

403
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,830
From the Capital Garrison.

404
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,310
They want to take her away as well?

405
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,280
Yeah!

406
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,190
I have turned them down

407
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,590
in the name of the Investigator's Office.

408
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,520
The Capital Garrison,

409
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,110
the Prefecture of Capital City,

410
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,520
and the Ministry of Penalty

411
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,470
all want you.

412
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,430
You are after all

413
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,430
a live Beiqi agent.

414
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,760
Once they get

415
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,710
any new intelligence from you,

416
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
it will be a great achievement.

417
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,950
You know it very well that

418
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,230
no matter to which side I hand you over,

419
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,710
what awaits you ahead

420
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,430
is endless excruciation.

421
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,520
Dying will be luxurious

422
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,230
by then.

423
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,590
Your heartbeat is faster. Are you nervous?

424
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,880
Who is the head of conspiracy
for the Niulan Street assassination?

425
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,110
Why does it have to have a head?

426
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,800
Why can't I be the person

427
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,920
to have planned it all?

428
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,760
You don't have the motive to kill me.

429
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
Do you really think

430
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm so deeply into you,

431
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,760
Mr. Fan?

432
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,640
You're a Beiqi agent

433
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,800
who has been lurking in the capital city for so many years.

434
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,310
No one knows

435
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,400
how much efforts you've made

436
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,400
to become the courtesan in the Joy Tsin House.

437
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,350
The people you're in touch with
are all high officials and celebrities.

438
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,830
It's the prime time

439
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,920
to collect intelligence.

440
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,760
Your exposure of identity now

441
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,070
will ruin all your previous efforts.

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,950
It'll make sense

443
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,640
if it's the Crown Prince, His Majesty,

444
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
or the Prime Minister that you're trying to kill

445
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,160
after all these efforts.

446
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,760
It is otherwise

447
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,350
if your target is me.

448
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,040
What fantastic reasoning!

449
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,830
Is that a confirmation

450
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,110
that someone else is behind it?

451
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,640
Why don't you figure it out yourself

452
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,520
since you're so smart?

453
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,760
Who is it?

454
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,920
Why don't you just tell me

455
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,560
and I'll save your life?

456
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,800
As you said

457
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,680
just now,

458
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,000
every ministry wants to interrogate me.

459
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,280
How do you save me from that?

460
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,160
You'll hand me over anyway

461
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,040
after we arrive at the capital city tomorrow.

462
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,470
It makes no difference

463
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,110
to say it or not to say it.

464
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,520
You're the prisoner of the Investigator's Office.

465
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't need to hand you over.

466
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,310
Should you be really important

467
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,590
in the Investigator's Office,

468
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,070
how come you chase me

469
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,040
without any retinues?

470
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,800
That's non-sense. I am his retinue.

471
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,520
Have some water please, Your Excellency!

472
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,950
Keeping it a secret,

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
I may still get rescued by that person.

474
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,470
If I really speak it out,

475
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,470
I'll end up on the chopping block.

476
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,830
Saving you now is too difficult.

477
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,520
I would kill you to keep
your mouth shut if I were that big figure.

478
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,640
As you said yourself,

479
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,190
what awaits me ahead

480
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,590
is endless excruciation.

481
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,110
Getting killed

482
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,680
is no less of an extrication.

483
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,230
How about

484
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,830
you telling me the name secretly

485
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,040
and then I set you free secretly?

486
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,280
Are you serious?

487
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,280
Right now,

488
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,430
the eyes of every ministry are cast on me.

489
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,430
You dare to set me free now?

490
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,070
Your Excellency,

491
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,710
we'd better go back to watch over her.

492
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,190
No need.

493
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,310
I'm afraid this yard

494
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,520
should have been encircled

495
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,280
by all the scouts from different ministries.

496
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,070
She can't escape.

497
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,430
If we had known that earlier,

498
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,520
we could have taken our time

499
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,950
for the return trip.

500
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,280
Black knights' showing up

501
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,350
means the Head

502
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,470
already knows about it.

503
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,430
If we don't return immediately,

504
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,560
it's very suspicious that we're colluding with the enemies.

505
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,470
That's dangerous to the family.

506
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
You're right!

507
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,430
But Master Shadow said

508
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,920
you can do whatever you think necessary

509
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,000
and the Head will help you

510
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,830
if anything goes wrong.

511
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,310
Chen Pingping and I are neither families nor friends.

512
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,070
Why would he help me?

513
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,760
Your Excellency still don't trust him.

514
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
Human mind is changeable.

515
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,230
I can't trust him

516
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,950
before I meet him in person.

517
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,310
Your Excellency,

518
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,160
before handing over Si Lili,

519
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,040
you still have another option.

520
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,830
Do you mean to lynch?

521
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,040
Yeah!

522
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,400
Now Si Lili is under your control.

523
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,920
If you lynch her,

524
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,470
she probably will tell the truth

525
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,520
after one night's of torture.

526
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,950
It's very easy

527
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,640
to torture a weak lady.

528
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,920
But if we have no bottom-line,

529
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,590
are we any different from animals?

530
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,920
You're right, Your Excellency!

531
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,560
So,

532
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
we'll have to wait

533
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,350
for other chances

534
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,230
after we get back to the capital city.

535
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,400
Wang Qinian!

536
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,470
If I chose to lynch

537
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,470
just now,

538
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,760
will you leave me?

539
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,560
If Your Excellency has no bottom-line,

540
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,350
then my monthly payment

541
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,680
of 150 taels of silvers

542
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,830
will not be guaranteed.

543
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,760
50 taels! 50 taels!

544
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,950
Don't worry, Your Excellency!

545
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,710
As long as you keep paying me 50 taels of silver,

546
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,470
I will always follow you

547
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,280
and serve you.

548
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,110
They are all

549
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,310
so eager!

550
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,400
It is a big case after all.

551
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,190
If you don't have the support

552
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,310
from the Investigator's Office,

553
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,470
we may not be able to hold her.

554
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,950
Si Lili is the prisoner of the Investigator's Office.

555
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,830
Your Excellencies,

556
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,830
please make way for us!

557
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,760
Mr. Fan,

558
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,950
we have no objection

559
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,710
if the Investigator's Office

560
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,160
really wants the prisoner.

561
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,070
Please show us the arrest warrant

562
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,400
of the Investigator's Office.

563
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,680
We'll make it up later on.

564
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,640
I'm afraid that's a breach of the rule.

565
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,280
Here comes the arrest warrant!

566
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,400
The Investigator's Office
is directly affiliated with His Majesty.

567
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,950
It has the right to fetch anyone for interrogation

568
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,560
for all matters in and out of the capital city.

569
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,110
Here is the arrest warrant!

570
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,100
If you don't have His Majesty's sacred edict,

571
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,190
=Yan Ruohai, Director of the Fourth Division=
If you don't have His Majesty's sacred edict,

572
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,500
=Yan Ruohai, Director of the Fourth Division
of Nanqing Investigator's Office=

573
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,400
I'll take her away.

574
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,950
Whoever disagrees can come and have a try.

575
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,590
Follow me!

576
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,070
Sister!

577
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,680
Sister!

578
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,310
Fan Xian is back!

579
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640
How do you know?

580
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,160
The whole city has seen him.

581
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,830
Did he make it?

582
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,350
Fan Xian escort Si Lili

583
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,230
back to the capital city.

584
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,680
There are a lot of people at the city gate,

585
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,160
seemingly to take Si Lili away.

586
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,830
Thanks to the showing up

587
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,070
of Yan Ruohai,

588
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,000
Director of the Fourth Division of the Investigator's Office.

589
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,000
He held a paper

590
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,710
and helped them inside.

591
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
He really seized her?

592
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,160
Sister,

593
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,110
you don't look happy about it.

594
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,920
It is not necessarily a good thing.

595
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,040
Why do you think so?

596
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,190
Where are you going, sister?

597
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,560
Why are you still following me?

598
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,760
Your Excellency,

599
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,110
Si Lili's case

600
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,760
is connected with the Niulan Street assassination.

601
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,950
Can I take charge of the trial?

602
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,680
Do you think I'll hand her over to you

603
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,560
now that I've come in person?

604
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,880
Your Excellency!

605
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,470
Agents and military organizations
are in the domain of the Fourth Division.

606
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,560
You're off the case.

607
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,520
She was captured by me.

608
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
You have all the credit to the capture.

609
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,350
Let that write off

610
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,710
Wang Qinian's stealing of the file.

611
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,160
The assassination is after all related to me.

612
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,280
Then you surely need to stay out to avoid suspicion.

613
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,350
Go back!

614
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,680
Or you want a fight with me?

615
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,710
Mr. Fan, aren't you gonna save me?

616
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,950
Where are your actions?

617
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,590
Your Excellency!

618
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,040
Your Highness!

619
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,310
Fan Ruoruo, the daughter of Assistant
Minister of Ministry of Revenue Fan Jian,

620
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,760
wants to see you.

621
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,880
How come she comes to me?

622
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,760
I asked her the reason.

623
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,190
She doesn't want to tell me.

624
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,110
What the procedures they are!

625
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,000
Let her in.

626
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,430
Yes!

627
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,400
Your Excellency!

628
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,830
Your Excellency!

629
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,110
Your Excellency!

630
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,160
She is gone!

631
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,520
What's the point of keeping that?

632
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,190
Dismantle it and get it disposed!

633
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,880
Don't be mad, Your Excellency!

634
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,470
After all, Yan Bingyun, his son,

635
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,680
went to Beiqi

636
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,160
because of you.

637
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,280
Naturally, he's a bit apathetic to you

638
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,920
which makes sense.

639
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,760
You're hungry, aren't you?

640
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,800
What did you say?

641
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,800
We've been rushing for so many days.

642
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,560
Shall I treat you with a good meal?

643
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,760
No, that's not needed.

644
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,350
I have to

645
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,590
go home

646
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,400
and let my wife know I'm back safe and sound.

647
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,230
And, I miss my daughter now.

648
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,430
Right!

649
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,000
Come to me after you're done!

650
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,640
As you're in my team,

651
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,230
we need to report to the mansion together.

652
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,190
Yes, Your Excellency!

653
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,870
So, you're alright?

654
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,360
Of course!

655
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
Remember to come to my mansion.

656
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,190
It's wide spread that

657
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,840
Fan Ruoruo is the first talented girl in the capital city.

658
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,600
Lady Ruoruo, have you heard it?

659
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm too humble to deserve praises like this.

660
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,360
Why do you come here?

661
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,760
Your Highness, please ask the guards to leave us alone.

662
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,280
You can talk now.

663
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,120
I believe Your Highness already know

664
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,040
Si Lili is escorted back to the capital city.

665
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,520
Fan Xian is really knowledgeable.

666
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,040
Firstly, he shocked the crowd with a poem.

667
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,760
Then he killed an Eighth Dan
Martial Arts Master on the street.

668
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,630
Now he captured the Beiqi agent

669
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,630
with his own hands.

670
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,280
He's impressive.

671
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,870
Acting too wild is easy to cause trouble.

672
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm willing to monitor my brother's behaviors

673
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,760
for Your Highness.

674
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,800
If he acts too exceptionally,

675
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,120
I'd report to you in private.

676
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,320
I heard that

677
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,950
you have a really deep tie with Fan Xian

678
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,910
as brother and sister.

679
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,230
That's why I need to protect his life.

680
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,390
You think I'm going to kill him?

681
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,520
That's not important.

682
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,150
My brother is arrogant and doesn't refrain himself

683
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,520
from all the disrespect to you.

684
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,950
Sooner or later,

685
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,320
the whole family will get involved in his convictions.

686
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,000
I do so

687
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,080
for the good of the Fan mansion.

688
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,910
Interesting!

689
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,080
My Lady!

690
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,120
-My Lady! -What happened?

691
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,280
He... He... He...

692
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,910
Calm down!

693
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,280
Isn't he the miracle-working doctor?

694
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,190
He is the miracle-working doctor and also Fan Xian.

695
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,560
I need to talk to him.

696
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,760
Leave us and close the door!

697
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,120
Leave!

698
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,520
Why do you come in day time?

699
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
I just got back and I want to meet you.

700
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,470
It's said you captured Si Lili.

701
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,470
Are you hurt?

702
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,560
Safe and sound!

703
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,320
I can't get hurt

704
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,280
with my proficiency at martial art.

705
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,520
Where is she?

706
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,870
As soon as I went through the gate,

707
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,360
both the Ministry of Personnel
and the Ministry of Penalty came to take her over.

708
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,630
She was eventually taken away by the Investigator's Office.

709
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,800
Alright! Let's not talk about these.

710
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,390
Is that edible?

711
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,390
I feel hungry now.

712
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,470
That's my leftover.

713
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,430
I don't mind!

714
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,760
You won't give up like this.

715
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,470
You can't let go of Teng Zijing's death.

716
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,560
Don't talk!

717
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,950
I just want to sit beside you quietly

718
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,230
like this for a while.

719
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,190
I always wondered

720
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,870
if I hadn't gone to the Qing Temple that day,

721
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,520
I would not have met you

722
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,910
holding a drumstick.

723
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,320
Time flows like a river. Lives are like fishes in it.

724
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,560
They meet in undercurrent and rapid torrent.

725
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,150
We're destined to meet.

726
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,150
Even if we hadn't met on that day,

727
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,520
we'd meet elsewhere.

728
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,150
We're destined to meet?

729
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,600
Perhaps!

730
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,910
I feel so much settled

731
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,560
after hearing your words.

732
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,760
You can turn to Ye Ling'er!

733
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,000
Ye Ling'er? What do I turn to her for?

734
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,870
She's been to the Joy Tsin House.

735
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,870
Why would she go there?

736
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,910
When she knew

737
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,040
you are Fan Xian on that day,

738
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,600
she insisted in visiting the Joy Tsin House

739
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,710
to check out if there is anything

740
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,630
between you and Si Lili.

741
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,870
After that,

742
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,760
the news became wide spread

743
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,120
that she fell into the water and got saved.

744
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,120
She never came to meet me

745
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,230
ever since then.

746
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,710
I think

747
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
she could have seen something on that day.

748
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,120
What a coincidence, Mr. Lin.

749
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
I'm diagnosing for her.

750
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,560
Brother!

751
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,600
Why are you mad?

752
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,430
You, a bastard from Danzhou!

753
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,430
How dare you step into my sister's room?

754
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,190
How do you know I'm Fan Xian?

755
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,600
I must kill you with my sword today.

756
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,150
Take out your sword then.

757
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,560
Brother, we didn't do anything shameful.

758
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,150
If anyone knows about this,

759
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
your reputation will be ruined.

760
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,600
But we have marriage contract.

761
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,910
You can't marry this guy.

762
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,000
Why do you hate Fan Xian

763
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,040
so much?

764
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,630
It is treacherous of him

765
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,710
to disguise himself as doctor to meet you.

766
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,320
If he really cares about you,

767
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,000
he should think

768
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,230
for your reputation.

769
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,000
How could he do something like this?

770
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,840
He's such a villain and not good at all.

771
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,520
He is not that type of person.

772
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,560
It's just that

773
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,520
his idea

774
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,670
differs from what people usually think.

775
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,760
You're too naive.

776
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,430
I'm a man as well.

777
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,710
You may be cheated by him, but I won't.

778
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,000
From today on,

779
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,870
I'll send the guards here.

780
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,710
If Fan Xian dares to come again,

781
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,910
I'll kill him without mercy.

782
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,360
That's going too far.

783
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,280
Aren't you gonna ask me?

784
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,950
Ask you what?

785
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,840
Who wanted to kill Fan Xian.

786
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
I'm not the interrogator.

787
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,600
Who is it then?

788
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,520
Chen Pingping is not here.

789
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,150
Is it Zhu Ge from the First Division?

790
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,190
I'm waiting.

791
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,120
For what?

792
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,630
For the interrogator to come.

793
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,040
Can I help you?

794
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,870
I'm Fan Xian.

795
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,430
I want to meet Your Lady, Ye Ling'er!

796
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,910
One moment please.

797
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,230
What can I do for you?

798
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,190
I heard that

799
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,190
you fell into the Liujing River the other day.

800
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,800
Why do you ask that?

801
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,190
Wan'er told me

802
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,430
you visited the Joy Tsin House

803
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,390
to investigate Si Lili.

804
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,870
How could it be him?

805
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,360
Why did you fell into the river?

806
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,390
What did you witness

807
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,800
on the boat on that day?

808
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,190
I didn't see anything.

809
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,190
You're lying!

810
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,760
You know that guy!

811
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,520
No!

812
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,230
No?

813
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,430
That means you did see someone.

814
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,520
Stop asking!

815
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,080
You're daughter of the Chief Guard of the capital city,

816
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,520
but you still dare not

817
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,190
to say who it is.

818
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,600
It must be someone

819
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,000
with enormous power.

820
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,460
In the river of history,

821
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,660
time goes round and round.

822
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,020
Memories about the former and present lives

823
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,900
join each other in an endless way.

824
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,500
In the long drunken Milky Way,

825
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,220
one season follows another in a flash,

826
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,420
and the wild geese are flying south.

827
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,340
I just can't give up

828
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,340
to be with you for my whole life.

829
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,620
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

830
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,420
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

831
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,300
Year after year in the wandering,

832
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,860
I count the remaining years.

833
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,060
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

834
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,620
even though we have ended up the destiny,

835
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,300
I never feel regretful.

836
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,260
In such a chaotic world,

837
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,020
I still miss you as ever.

838
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,660
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

839
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,380
With a gentle heart,

840
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,940
I cherish our remaining years.

841
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,780
Even though we have to go through

842
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,740
all the hardships along the journey,

843
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:43,060
you always stay by my side,

844
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,820
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

845
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,740
Year after year in the wandering,

846
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,100
I count the remaining years.

847
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,460
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

848
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,260
even though we end up the destiny,

849
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,700
I never feel regretful.

850
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,620
In such a chaotic world,

851
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,580
I still miss you as ever.

852
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,260
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

853
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,020
With a gentle heart,

854
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,420
I cherish our remaining years.

855
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,220
Even though we have to go through

856
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,380
all the hardships along the journey,

857
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:23,660
you always stay by my side...
