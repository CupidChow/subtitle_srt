1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 15

16
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,950
They all died.

17
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,950
Something must be going wrong.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,830
If the commander committed suicide
because he colluded with the enemy,

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,080
how about his servants?

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,160
Why did they also do that?

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,870
He just received visitors in the study,

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
but they're gone.

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,440
It's all my fault.

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,360
If I had told you earlier

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,550
about this matter,

26
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,630
maybe they could've been saved.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,310
The same thing would happen even if you had.

28
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,000
They want me to be here a little late.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,720
Just a little late.

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,030
This is a warning. This is a threat.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,720
It must be someone with supreme power

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
so that he can eradicate the whole
family of the commander in a flash.

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,270
How is it going at you side?

34
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,240
This is the token of the secret agent from Beiqi.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,910
Token?

36
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,360
Beiqi has secret agents

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,630
that lurk in Nanqing.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,160
They use tokens like this to deploy subordinates

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,320
and conduct activities.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In that sense,

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,630
Cheng Jushu is a Beiqi secret agent.

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm afraid so!

43
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,320
What an honor to me!

44
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,190
This unknown big hand

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,360
unites Beiqi

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,000
just to kill me.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,190
Your Excellency,

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,270
It's getting more and more complicated.

49
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,240
Do we still need to continue with it?

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,030
Yes, we do!

51
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,470
We can't let Teng Zijing die for nothing.

52
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,550
I'll never give up

53
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,830
before finding out the true killer.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,080
But all the clues are ended now.

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,000
How is it going

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,800
with that big guy?

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,630
Why did you

58
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,800
fight him?

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,800
Where did you see him?

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,830
In a courtyard beside the stable

61
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,360
on Dashu Street.

62
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,720
Maybe not!

63
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,030
Let's forget about

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,160
the identity of the big hand behind the scene,

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
the involvement of the Beiqi secret agents,

66
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,600
the private sales of military supplies,

67
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,190
and the eradication of the commander's family.

68
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,550
What do we investigate then

69
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,750
if we forget them all?

70
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,000
Forget about all the non-essentials

71
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,270
and focus on the assassination itself.

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,240
Why did Cheng Jushu and the female assassinators

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,800
choose Niulan Street for the assassination?

74
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,270
You were heading towards Joy Tsin House

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,550
and would undoubtedly pass by Niulan Street.

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,190
How did they know it?

77
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,520
Perhaps they didn't.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,910
They just followed secretly

79
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,470
and planned to do it by chance.

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,320
Not possible!

81
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,440
Two assassinators attacked from front
and back respectively that day.

82
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
Cheng Jushu hid at the back of the wall.

83
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,880
It was an ambush

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
well planned in advance.

85
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,640
They had known I would pass by Niulan Street well before it.

86
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,390
Who else knew

87
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,350
you were going to Joy Tsin House?

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,160
A lot of people could know that.

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,670
People from your residence?

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,070
They have nothing to do with it.

91
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,550
Is it possible that

92
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,480
they leaked it unintentionally?

93
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,110
Don't think too much.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,720
The person who made the appointment with me naturally knew it.

95
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,440
The Second Prince?

96
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,040
He is under too much suspicion

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,790
to do it

98
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,760
which makes it seem deliberate.

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,510
Then there isn't any more suspect left.

100
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,200
Aren't you aware

101
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,040
since it was an appointment,

102
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,070
Joy Tsin House would need to

103
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,040
prepare the banquet in advance.

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,510
It's the people from Joy Tsin House?!

105
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,670
They also knew

106
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,200
I would pass by Niulan Street.

107
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,670
But Miss Si Lili and you

108
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
like each other so much.

109
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,480
People from her side

110
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,600
shouldn't have any problem.

111
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,920
I have no connection

112
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,000
with Si Lili.

113
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
In retrospect,

114
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,110
this Miss

115
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,350
doesn't look like

116
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,320
a courtesan in brothel at all.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,950
So we need to go

118
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,440
to Joy Tsin House immediately.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Exactly!

120
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
Let me in!

121
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,000
No! No!

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
Sir, you can't come inside.

123
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,640
Why not?

124
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,830
Listen!

125
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,070
I made an appointment

126
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,000
with Miss Yunjian a long time ago.

127
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,720
What's the reason not to let me in?

128
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,230
There is no reason.

129
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,920
I must get in!

130
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,390
Sir!

131
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,110
Sir!

132
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,440
You probably don't know that

133
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,270
Miss Si Lili's boat

134
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,200
has been burnt.

135
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,160
The government is investigating

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,270
the cause of the fire.

137
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,600
No one is allowed to go inside.

138
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Please forgive us.

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,550
I didn't set up the fire.

140
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,670
I must go in.

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,390
Gentlemen, please!

142
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,550
Please don't go in there!

143
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,480
Excuse me, please!

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Go! Go! Go!

145
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,670
Excuse me!

146
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
You said the boat got burnt?

147
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
When did that happen?

148
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,830
Sir, it was this noon.

149
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,270
It's such a pity

150
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,670
that a good boat got burnt

151
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,480
to ashes.

152
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,790
Where is Si Lili now?

153
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,230
She left!

154
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,440
Someone saw her going out of the city.

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,550
She must be frustrated

156
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,230
that the boat got burnt.

157
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,480
Gentlemen,

158
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,950
please come some other day.

159
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,720
Please...

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,950
Excuse us, please!

161
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,230
There is no clue

162
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,550
up to this point.

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,760
Your Excellency,

164
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,920
if we can find Si Lili,

165
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,920
there should be some clue.

166
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,950
Didn't you hear it?

167
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,950
She's gone for quite a while.

168
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,670
How do we find her?!

169
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,510
Maybe you don't know that

170
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,670
the Investigator's Office

171
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,070
has two masters of hunting.

172
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,550
One of them

173
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,320
is called Zong Zhui.

174
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,550
Generally, he follows the Head.

175
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,000
He is not in the capital city now.

176
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,880
As for the other one,

177
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,670
would you like to have a guess

178
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,550
who the other guy is?

179
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,950
Is that you?

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,510
I'm afraid yes.

181
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,790
It's surprising

182
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,320
that you are just a clerk with that skill.

183
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,270
Being a clerk is pretty good.

184
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,880
It runs no risk and therefore super safe.

185
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,070
Why do you help me?

186
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Your Excellency,

187
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,510
I'm driven out

188
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,550
by the Investigator's Office now.

189
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,510
But my whole family

190
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,390
still needs sustenance.

191
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,600
I learned that by working for you,

192
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,390
I can earn 50 taels of silver a month,

193
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,070
and there is land and ox.

194
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,270
If you can really hunt her down for me,

195
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,600
I'll give you 10 extra pigs.

196
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,720
Fantastic!

197
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,110
Your Excellency,

198
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,350
my girl

199
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,350
loves pork belly best.

200
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,790
Are you really able to hunt her down?

201
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,550
That's not a problem to me.

202
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,920
The problem lies in you.

203
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,040
What do you mean?

204
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,110
Si Lili left the capital city so timely.

205
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,790
She could most likely

206
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,640
be the Beiqi secret agent

207
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,350
in view of it.

208
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,950
Her escape

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,040
must be a plan well in advance

210
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,230
so as to coordinate with the backup team.

211
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,830
If Your Excellency must hunt her down,

212
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,000
we must go out of the capital city

213
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,880
and run endless risks

214
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,640
to our lives.

215
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,480
Your Excellency,

216
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,550
are you willing to step on such a dangerous journey?

217
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,600
It was my brother who was murdered.

218
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,270
In that case,

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,280
please follow me to go out of the capital city

220
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,640
and start up this long journey.

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
Where are you going?

222
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,710
Where to?

223
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,150
Aren't we going out of here?

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you want to do here?

225
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,640
All my equipment is at home.

226
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,880
I need to fetch them.

227
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,150
Is this your house?

228
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,400
Yes, it is.

229
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,520
Why don't you just walk in?

230
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,030
My wife is home. It's better to be careful.

231
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Wang Qinian,

232
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
you're henpecked!

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,790
Your Excellency,

234
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,080
my wife has a nickname,

235
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,350
tigress-like Mrs. Wang.

236
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,400
What like?

237
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,110
Tigress.

238
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,670
Si Lili has gone for a while.

239
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,350
Let's hurry up.

240
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,080
It's fine!

241
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,520
It's easier to hunt

242
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,960
in day time.

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
My wife is deeply asleep.

244
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,030
Excuse me for a while.

245
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,550
I'll be back soon.

246
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,080
Please keep silent, Your Excellency!

247
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,710
Where are you going again, Wang Qinian?

248
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,230
Did you hide money in the case?

249
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,400
Listen to me, darling!

250
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,960
I've got business to do.

251
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,590
Done, Your Excellency!

252
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,590
It's done! Let's go!

253
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,760
Your Excellency!

254
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,840
Well done!

255
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,550
That's admiring.

256
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,200
Did you just say that

257
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,350
it's easier to hunt in day time?

258
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,350
Yes!

259
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,590
Then I also have a person to meet.

260
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,760
Why haven't you gone to bed?

261
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,110
I heard that you killed a man on the street.

262
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,590
I'm not fond of killing people.

263
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,230
That was to avenge Zijing.

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,280
Avenging friends is what man should do.

265
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,520
But today,

266
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,880
you're not here to see me.

267
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,320
How can you tell?

268
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,150
You didn't wear the nocturnal costume

269
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,280
or the perfume.

270
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,440
Wan'er,

271
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,280
Si Lili from Joy Tsin House

272
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,280
may have a hand

273
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,840
in the assassination.

274
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,030
She is at large out of the capital city.

275
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,350
I have to get her back.

276
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,110
You are leaving soon?

277
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,550
Yes, but I thought you'll be worried.

278
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,470
So here I am to say goodbye.

279
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,200
When will you be back?

280
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,960
As soon as I get her.

281
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,280
What if you don't?

282
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,590
I won't stop you

283
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,000
from what you want to do,

284
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,670
but it's impossible for me

285
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,440
not to worry.

286
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,230
Wan'er.

287
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,960
How about a hug before I leave?

288
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,880
It's dawn. I gotta go.

289
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,910
I'll be worried every day.

290
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,790
If you don't want me to,

291
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,640
come back.

292
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
The gate is open now.

293
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,670
It is the right time to go out.

294
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,520
Don't panic!

295
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,520
Your Excellency,

296
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,590
it's His Majesty's will

297
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,880
to let me kill Cheng Jushu.

298
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,280
Do you want to disobey His Majesty's will?

299
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,670
It is him that I am arresting.

300
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,280
Wang Qinian

301
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,230
secretly checked the confidential files.

302
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,200
According to the rule in the Investigator's Office,

303
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,760
he must be interrogated.

304
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Here is the Director-General's token.
Who dare to touch him?!

305
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,110
The Director-General

306
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,000
shall also obey the rule in the Investigator's Office.

307
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,640
I designated Wang Qinian

308
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,960
to do it all.

309
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,470
You are still young.

310
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,030
I'm afraid you were cheated by him.

311
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,110
Take him!

312
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,880
Your Highness Earl Sinan!

313
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,880
Your Excellency, it's been a long time.

314
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,550
He is a kid and knows nothing.

315
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,440
Please forgive him for my sake.

316
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,080
I know it all about what happened to you.

317
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,640
What's the plan?

318
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,030
We're going out of the capital
city to hunt down the suspect.

319
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,440
These guards have special identity.

320
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
They can't go out without permission.

321
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,200
So I can't send anyone to go with you.

322
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,350
It's enough for just the two of us.

323
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,470
I'm really regretful

324
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,800
to have got you here.

325
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:12,880
Off you go!

326
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,760
Your dad is awesome.

327
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,230
These guards are imperial guards.

328
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,160
Even Prince Jing doesn't necessarily

329
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
have guards like that.

330
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
Your Excellency, the horses from just now

331
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,400
are military horses.

332
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,230
I know.

333
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,190
The Ministry of Revenue

334
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,000
should not have guards like that.

335
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,470
Should we get it investigated?

336
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,400
Those guards are most probably

337
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,230
guards for His Majesty.

338
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,470
That's a lot of trust from His Majesty to Earl Sinan.

339
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,040
The Head told us

340
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,830
before he left

341
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,950
that do not collide with Earl Sinan

342
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,430
unless it's national treason

343
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,560
or regicide.

344
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,800
That's very special treatment for an Assistant Minister.

345
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,520
The Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue

346
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,950
and the Head were serving His Majesty

347
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,040
ever since His Majesty was a crown prince.

348
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,070
That's very unusual friendship.

349
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,280
Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue Fan Jian

350
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,040
pays respects to Your Majesty!

351
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,830
Do you know why you are summoned here?

352
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,710
Yes, I do.

353
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,350
Say it!

354
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,680
I used the guards from Your Majesty

355
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,190
to stop the Investigator's Office.

356
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,430
Do you admit it's wrong?

357
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,520
I don't think it's wrong,

358
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,230
but if Your Majesty want to punish me for it,

359
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,830
I can take it.

360
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,520
Is it not wrong to go beyond your power?!

361
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,040
I indeed went beyond my power,

362
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,350
but that was to help Fan Xian

363
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,430
get out of the capital city,

364
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,760
which is to hunt down

365
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,230
the Beiqi secret agent,

366
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,640
Si Lili.

367
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,710
Who gave Fan Xian that power?

368
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,280
It is right Your Majesty!

369
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,110
I didn't issue that order.

370
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,470
Your Majesty surely didn't,

371
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,040
but as Your Majesty's servant, I should
be able to comprehend your will

372
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,920
even without an order.

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,590
If Your Majesty don't want Fan Xian

374
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,830
to handle this matter,

375
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,760
then you won't let him know

376
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,470
that Cheng Jushu was released.

377
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,950
And less likely to release him

378
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,430
after he killed Cheng Jushu.

379
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,520
Wang Qinian secretly checked the confidential
files of the Investigator's Office.

380
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,710
Zhu Ge wanted to convict him,

381
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,560
but also got suppressed by Your Majesty.

382
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,710
All of that

383
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,710
is to let Fan Xian go on with the investigation.

384
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,430
Done?

385
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,230
Not yet!

386
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,800
I have to talk about the cause as well.

387
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,590
Fan Xian has no titles.

388
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,950
Why do Your Majesty

389
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,400
want him to investigate it?

390
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Your Majesty want to test his capability.

391
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,400
Once he gets married,

392
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,520
he will become the manager of Neiku

393
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,000
to manage all the assets and power.

394
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,590
There will be

395
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,000
lots of underwater competition by then.

396
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,000
He will mess it up if he is incapable.

397
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,830
Hunting down Si Lili

398
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
is a test

399
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,680
from which you can observe his judgement and actions.

400
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,070
What if your guess

401
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,830
is all wrong?!

402
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,190
I've been serving Your Majesty for so many years.

403
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,230
I believe my own judgement.

404
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,430
Besides, if I'm really wrong,

405
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
Your Majesty won't mind

406
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,040
in view of my loyalty

407
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,160
and my thoughtfulness to Your Majesty's will.

408
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,560
Does Fan Xian learn all his cunningness

409
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,430
from you?

410
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm kind in nature

411
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
and can't take comments like that.

412
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,760
Kind in nature?

413
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,280
Do you think Fan Xian can catch her?

414
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,400
I bet he can!

415
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,680
You intend to make a bet with me?

416
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,230
I've been managing the Ministry of Revenue.

417
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,160
Calculating and gambling is my expertise.

418
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,000
Why you lose to your own son

419
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,310
in Pai Gow?

420
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,190
How do Your Majesty know this?

421
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,040
Can't I know it?

422
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,950
Yes, of course you can.

423
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,830
Your Majesty can have transparency

424
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,280
about all the things I do.

425
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,230
Your transparency?!

426
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,110
How about Fan Xian?

427
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,070
Well...

428
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,640
Your Majesty have to ask him on your own.

429
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,310
That depends on if he can catch the suspect.

430
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,190
Watch out!

431
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm sorry!

432
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,400
Your Excellency,

433
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,590
they said they were on duty yesterday as well.

434
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,040
They saw Si Lili

435
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,400
fleeing out of town.

436
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,280
Which direction did she go?

437
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,160
To the north.

438
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,070
Then a few horses showed up.

439
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,680
The riders wear bamboo hats with similar dresses.

440
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,310
It's difficult to tell which one is Si Lili.

441
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,280
Then they went in their own separate ways.

442
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,710
So well-prepared they are!

443
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,760
What's wrong, Your Excellency?

444
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,160
Nothing.

445
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,040
I feel like something is not right.

446
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,830
What is it?

447
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,710
It's hard to say.

448
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
It could be the way

449
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,710
Si Lili escaped.

450
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,350
Multiple teams starting out together to create confusion.

451
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,400
That's a smart way to escape.

452
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,350
I know,

453
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,280
but still something is missed out.

454
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,760
Let's leave it!

455
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,520
How do you plan to hunt?

456
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,070
Your Excellency, please follow me.

457
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,660
=Investigator's Office=

458
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,040
Your Excellency, the pigeons fetched some messages again.

459
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,110
What are you doing?

460
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,830
Shoot a bird!

461
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,560
Where is the bird?!

462
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,430
It will come

463
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,680
in a minute.

464
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,310
Si Lili arranged six teams to go north

465
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,190
as the escaping plan.

466
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,830
Two of their whereabouts

467
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,040
have been captured by our regional secret agents.

468
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,110
The rest are being tracked.

469
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,830
Fan Xian must be after her out of the capital city.

470
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,590
It's not a concern

471
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,470
with his personal effort.

472
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,710
Si Lili will not

473
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,110
go out of our hands after all.

474
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,190
They would never expect

475
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,230
Your Excellency has detected it a long time ago

476
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,310
and sent different source of secret agents to investigate it.

477
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,880
Hunt down her teams one by one.

478
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,190
Don't let her escape out of Nanqing.

479
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,880
Yes!

480
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,190
There it goes!

481
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,190
A carrier pigeon?!

482
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,400
A carrier pigeon of the Investigator's Office.

483
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,430
Si Lili burnt the boat

484
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,230
and rode a horse out of town.

485
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,920
It must attract the attention

486
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,280
of the Investigator's Office.

487
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,160
Even though she arranged six teams,

488
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
her rough direction is to the north.

489
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,070
Most of the pigeons

490
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,310
from the north towns

491
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,760
will go through this place.

492
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,000
Si Lili is already being tracked.

493
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,400
Multiple teams are hunting her down.

494
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,640
Wait a minute! How do you know

495
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,350
the pigeons of the Investigator's Office

496
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,280
must go through here?

497
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,830
Honestly,

498
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,070
I have spent some time in the office

499
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,160
raising pigeons.

500
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,160
Won't it be noticed

501
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,040
that you shot their pigeon?

502
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,800
The Investigator's Office usually

503
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,310
sends out several pigeons in one go.

504
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,560
It's doesn't matter to have one of them missing.

505
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,640
Won't anyone notice it?

506
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,640
As pigeons usually come across predators like eagles

507
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,560
during their fly,

508
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
there is natural loss every month.

509
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,800
Besides,

510
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,560
I've raised pigeons for some time.

511
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,310
So I know

512
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,880
the number of pigeons coming back

513
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,830
always fluctuates.

514
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,310
No one will suspect.

515
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,710
What else have you raised other than pigeons?

516
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,760
Why do you ask so?

517
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,190
Save for a rainy day.

518
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,830
I must get prepared anyhow.

519
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,590
Here you go, sir! Tea for you!

520
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,520
Your Excellency,

521
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,640
I collected messages from different towns.

522
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,800
Two of the teams have been captured.

523
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,830
Neither of them is Si Lili.

524
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,110
The rest four teams are still being hunted.

525
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,430
How about Fan Xian? Is he still after her?

526
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,070
Fan Xian should not be able to catch up now.

527
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,040
Does Si Lili keep running towards the north?

528
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,470
Yeah, all the way north.

529
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,760
She should be heading to Beiqi.

530
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,190
Fetch the map!

531
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,280
Yes!

532
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,920
It's always passive to go from the behind.

533
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,470
As soon as we can figure out

534
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,880
where Si Lili

535
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,560
is running to,

536
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,880
we will be able to find the path

537
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,280
she has to go through.

538
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,830
Your Excellency, check this out!

539
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,280
This is a territory map I drew of

540
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,230
the mountains and rivers in the world.

541
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,430
This map

542
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,160
illustrates the scenic spots of the capital city in detail.

543
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,680
Two taels of silver.

544
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,040
It's super clear, isn't it?

545
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,760
I don't understand it at all.

546
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,760
Your Excellency, first of all,

547
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,640
we need to confirm

548
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,280
if Si Lili

549
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,310
is from Beiqi.

550
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,040
Her token as a secret agent is confirmed.

551
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,070
She is from Beiqi.

552
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,760
OK.

553
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,350
So she must go north.

554
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,400
But there are many ways

555
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,430
to go north.

556
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,190
But there are many military passes as well.

557
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,040
There aren't many ways

558
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,680
to go to Beiqi

559
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,310
without going through these passes.

560
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,190
Hold on a second.

561
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,160
What do these triangles

562
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,280
stand for?

563
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,000
Mountain ranges. Don't you understand?

564
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,880
How about these circles?

565
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Can' you see that they are lakes?!

566
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,520
And these rectangles?

567
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,590
Some are big and some are small.

568
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,640
Big ones are castles.

569
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,880
Small ones are passes.

570
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,800
Can't you understand

571
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,470
all these signs?

572
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,680
Wang,

573
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,800
your drawing

574
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,000
is really extraordinary.

575
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,470
Your Excellency, I feel flattered.

576
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,400
That is to say,

577
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,950
Si Lili must go through this little town

578
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,640
since she wants to go to Beiqi quickly.

579
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,400
This town is the only way

580
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,310
to Beiqi.

581
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,710
If she chooses any other way,

582
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,470
it will take far more time.

583
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,830
I'll arrange

584
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,110
a tight encirclement right away

585
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,950
and gather all the secret agents here.

586
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,190
We'll surely capture Si Lili

587
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,880
and take her back to the capital city.

588
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,680
Off you go!

589
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,830
Yes!

590
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,830
Now that I can detect this,

591
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,470
so can

592
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,070
His Excellency Zhu.

593
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,590
I don't think we have time

594
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,310
to capture Si Lili.

595
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,190
But the Investigator's Office has a lot of ears.

596
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,230
They can capture

597
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,400
Si Lili for sure.

598
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,070
No, I must interrogate her in person.

599
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,040
Definitely!

600
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,040
We just need to

601
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,470
go north slowly

602
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,880
and intercept the team

603
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,230
that escorts Si Lili back to the capital city.

604
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
When it comes, just take out
your token as Director-General

605
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,110
and require them to hand over the suspect.

606
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,710
No one will dare to disobey.

607
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,310
Your Excellency, what's up?

608
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm feeling a bit worried

609
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,560
ever since I came out of the capital city.

610
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,830
What you said just now

611
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,800
makes it even worse.

612
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,430
Did I say anything wrong?

613
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm also wondering

614
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,350
your drawing is simple

615
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,880
but your words

616
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,760
are full of wisdom.

617
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,110
Your Excellency, let's keep going while talking.

618
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,110
Wait a minute. Let me think about

619
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,520
which sentence is it

620
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,590
that makes me feel not right.

621
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,070
I got it!

622
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,710
Si Lili burnt the boat

623
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,710
and rode a horse out of town.

624
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
It must attract the attention

625
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,280
of the Investigator's Office.

626
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,400
Even though she arranged six teams,

627
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,400
but her rough direction is to the north.

628
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,680
Is there anything wrong with that?

629
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,350
The description is right, but the story is not right.

630
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,590
Have you ever considered

631
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,110
why Si Lili had to escape?

632
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,590
She is involved in the assassination at Niulan Street.

633
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,830
Of course, she needs to escape as soon as she can.

634
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,400
Then why would she burn the boat?

635
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,830
The boat...

636
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,520
She wanted to escape. Then escape!

637
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,350
What's the point of burning the boat?

638
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,950
Perhaps there were confidential letters

639
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,350
on the boat.

640
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,560
Then just burn the letters.

641
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,430
Right! It would be enough to burn the letters.

642
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,680
Why did she burn the boat?

643
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,680
Second question.

644
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,430
Why would she ride a horse out of town

645
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,470
and arrange six teams?

646
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,560
Certainly, to create confusion.

647
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,950
What if she disguised herself

648
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,800
and went out of town secretly?

649
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,880
No one ever suspected her yesterday.

650
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,880
If she leaves secretly,

651
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,640
it would be far more difficult to find her.

652
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,110
But she still cut a splash

653
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,950
by burning the boat and taking
a horse which is eye-catching.

654
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,830
What's the purpose of that?

655
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,110
To let everyone know

656
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,230
she had left.

657
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,680
At that time point, everyone's attention

658
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,590
would be on the north of the capital city,

659
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,040
trying to figure out her escaping route.

660
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,470
If I were her,

661
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,760
it's the right time

662
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,710
to get disappeared

663
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,590
when everyone's attention is diverted.

664
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,430
That means

665
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,350
none of these six teams

666
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,470
has Si Lili in them.

667
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,880
The real Si Lili

668
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,920
has long lurked

669
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,070
outside of everyone's attention.

670
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,760
That's something hard to understand.

671
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,520
It makes sense

672
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,350
if she escapes silently.

673
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,280
Why did she do all that?

674
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,640
Because of the tension

675
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,560
between Nanqing and Beiqi at the moment.

676
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,760
War could break out any time soon.

677
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,710
What's the connection with that?

678
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,800
The security at the north must be very strict now.

679
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,640
It's not the right time for her to go.

680
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,560
There would be an equally lot of passes

681
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,280
which are equally strict

682
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,110
if she escapes secretly.

683
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,400
After she did all that,

684
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,190
the security at the north

685
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,000
will check more strictly.

686
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,800
So she doesn't necessarily go north.

687
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,280
Doesn't she go back to Beiqi?

688
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,880
She does!

689
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,950
Wang Qinian

690
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,680
is there any other way to Beiqi

691
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,070
without going north?

692
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,160
The way to Beiqi without going north?!

693
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,590
Isn't that...

694
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
There is indeed a way.

695
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,230
Tell me about it!

696
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,190
Instead of going north, go east directly.

697
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,680
Find the merchant ships and return to Beiqi by sea.

698
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,800
Which port is the most possible?

699
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,950
Dongyi Town! Oh no!

700
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,590
We have very strict security at Dongyi Town.

701
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,160
Besides, there are a lot of passes

702
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,920
on the way to Dongyi Town as well.

703
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,310
Other than that,

704
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,430
this would be the most possible place.

705
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,400
Your Excellency,

706
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,880
do you find this place familiar?

707
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,070
With your drawing like this,

708
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,470
how should I find it familiar? Just say it.

709
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,800
This is the place

710
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Your Excellency grow up.

711
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,230
Danzhou harbor.

712
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,640
Yes, it is!

713
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,320
It's all within Nanqing

714
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,080
from the capital city to Danzhou harbor.

715
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,040
So it should be Danzhou harbor.

716
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,120
Check it out again!

717
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,080
From the north gate of the capital city

718
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,190
to Danzhou harbor,

719
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,230
which route is the most convenient?

720
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,760
What?

721
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,190
There is a lot of mountain ranges

722
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,950
and passes during the way

723
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,430
from the north gate to Danzhou harbor.

724
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,120
That's not an easy route either.

725
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,280
There is a simpler way.

726
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,360
What is it?

727
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,280
To return to the capital

728
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
and depart from the east gate.

729
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,120
To the east gate.

730
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,670
Stop!

731
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,710
Stand back!

732
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Where are you going?

733
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,870
I'm seriously ill.

734
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,150
My hometown is said to have a famous doctor,

735
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,040
so I want to go there and have a try.

736
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,430
Go! Go! Go!

737
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,190
Thank you!

738
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,150
Stop!

739
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,360
You don't need to go back.

740
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Move the carriage into the woods and burn it.

741
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,870
After that, leave to different directions
and don't leave any mark.

742
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,800
Yes!

743
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,600
According to Your Excellency's reasoning,

744
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,560
Si Lili may be ahead of us

745
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,280
for a short distance.

746
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,040
Indeed! Judging from their reaction,

747
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,190
Zhu Ge should find out

748
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,760
Si Lili's whereabouts today.

749
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,230
If she is patient enough,

750
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,150
she will wait for the Investigator's Office

751
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,560
to focus its attention all on the north

752
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,870
before she returns back to go eastwards.

753
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,280
Your Excellency's wisdom is indeed stunning.

754
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,630
I am totally shocked

755
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,600
by your extraordinary talent.

756
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,320
It gives me a constant sense of anxiety.

757
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,220
=Inn=

758
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,320
Excuse me,

759
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,600
feed my horse with premium forage

760
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,630
and give me a premium room.

761
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,870
Sure! This way please.

762
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,150
This is the room for you.

763
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,280
This way please.

764
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,870
Enjoy your stay!

765
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,950
Gentlemen, do you need accommodation?

766
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,910
No!

767
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:05,870
Yes!

768
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,950
Sure! Please come this way!

769
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,760
Your Excellency, let's have a look inside.

770
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,360
Come!

771
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,560
Sir, come this way!

772
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,870
Get us a good room!

773
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,470
Sure!

774
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,840
This is it.

775
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,280
Sir, that one is taken.

776
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,710
Come this way!

777
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,910
I'm sorry!

778
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,280
This room

779
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,600
faces the sun and it's spacious.

780
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,390
It's very cozy!

781
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:10,950
Your Excellency!

782
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,800
Do we really need the room?

783
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,520
Your Excellency, trust me!

784
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,630
After the long journey of hunting,

785
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,080
rest is more important than time.

786
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,910
Please!

787
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,390
Please!

788
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,080
Get us some hot water!

789
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,000
Sure! Please wait a moment!

790
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,280
How come Fan Xian is here?

791
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,080
Waiter!

792
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,280
Miss, what can I do for you?

793
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,040
Coming!

794
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,360
Sir, here comes the food for you.

795
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,320
Close the door!

796
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,120
Enjoy!

797
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,360
Your Excellency,

798
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,360
if Si Lili

799
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,000
really goes eastward,

800
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,150
we'll surely catch up with her

801
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,080
in two to three days.

802
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,760
She should have a horse.

803
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,910
Your Excellency,

804
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,760
if there is no backup horse,

805
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,910
she won't travel that fast with just one horse.

806
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,040
Just think about it!

807
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,280
The horse needs to take rests once in a while

808
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,190
when it is running.

809
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,190
And it has to be fed

810
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,950
with premium forage from time to time,

811
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,840
otherwise it will die

812
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,600
of fatigue.

813
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,670
The road we take

814
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,390
is actually a short cut between the hills

815
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,630
which is faster than the official road.

816
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,320
The shortest way is the straight line between two points.

817
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,080
What did you say?

818
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,840
Nothing!

819
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,040
Your Excellency,

820
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,390
will you pay

821
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,800
for the room and food?

822
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,390
Certainly!

823
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,910
Then it's not that weary!

824
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,190
Let's finish it!

825
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,230
Wait!

826
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,600
After you, Your Excellency!

827
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,360
It's poisonous!

828
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,760
Is it...

829
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,190
It seems we don't need to wait for two to three days.

830
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,950
It is made

831
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,190
by the kitchen.

832
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,360
Where did you fetch it after taken from the kitchen?

833
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,040
I fetched it directly to your room.

834
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,910
Who touched it in between?

835
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,600
No one!

836
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,150
Alright!

837
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,670
Then you're solely liable.

838
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,470
Come with me!

839
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,360
Look at him!

840
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,120
Look at him with your own eyes!

841
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,800
Don't you leave!

842
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,520
There is poison in the food and someone died with it.

843
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,710
What do we do now? I'll notify the imperial court!

844
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,470
No! No!

845
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,040
Well...

846
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,230
How could it happen?

847
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm afraid you're the murder

848
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
in this case.

849
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,800
No! No! No!

850
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,870
It's not me! It's not me!

851
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,630
Didn't you say

852
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,080
only the kitchen and you touched the food?

853
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,840
Or this inn

854
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,560
is a sinister inn?

855
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,870
No! No!

856
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,470
A lady touched it!

857
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,910
Who is the lady?

858
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,150
She checked in this afternoon as well!

859
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,280
She insisted on

860
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,520
checking out the quality of the food here

861
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,630
before she decided whether to eat here or not.

862
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,360
So I brought your food box to her

863
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,430
to have a look.

864
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,840
I did nothing else.

865
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,630
Why did you pick ours in particular?

866
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,560
Because you live close!

867
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,600
Just the opposite side.

868
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,710
He is alive again!

869
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,780
In the river of history,

870
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,980
time goes round and round.

871
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,340
Memories about the former and present lives

872
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,220
join each other in an endless way.

873
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,820
In the long drunken Milky Way,

874
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,540
one season follows another in a flash,

875
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,740
and the wild geese are flying south.

876
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,660
I just can't give up

877
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,660
to be with you for my whole life.

878
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,940
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

879
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,740
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

880
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,620
Year after year in the wandering,

881
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,180
I count the remaining years.

882
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,380
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

883
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,940
even though we have ended up the destiny,

884
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,620
I never feel regretful.

885
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,580
In such a chaotic world,

886
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,340
I still miss you as ever.

887
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,980
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

888
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,700
With a gentle heart,

889
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,260
I cherish our remaining years.

890
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,100
Even though we have to go through

891
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,060
all the hardships along the journey,

892
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:29,380
you always stay by my side,

893
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,140
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

894
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,060
Year after year in the wandering,

895
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,420
I count the remaining years.

896
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,780
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

897
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,580
even though we end up the destiny,

898
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,020
I never feel regretful.

899
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,940
In such a chaotic world,

900
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,900
I still miss you as ever.

901
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,580
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

902
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,340
With a gentle heart,

903
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,740
I cherish our remaining years.

904
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,540
Even though we have to go through

905
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,700
all the hardships along the journey,

906
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:09,980
you always stay by my side...
