1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 29

16
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,720
My mind told me not to go,

17
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,080
but I'm curious.

18
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,440
What do you think?

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,550
Up to you.

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,040
She asked me to be nice to you.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,440
I don't understand.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,270
You're a martial arts master.

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,950
You don't need me to take care of you, right?

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,230
She said

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,830
vitality Qi doesn't exist.

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,240
It doesn't now that she said so.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,830
What is it?

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
The thing I've been practicing.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
No idea.

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,360
She said she'd give me an answer,

31
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,600
but I ended up

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,630
becoming more confused.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
It's just a trap.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,030
Uncle,

35
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,600
I think

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,750
I'd better

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,440
forget about it.

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,030
Now that I came here,

39
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,910
I should live well here

40
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,470
and take good care of people around me.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,520
Okay.

42
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,390
But the premise is that

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,630
nobody found you sneaking into the imperial harem.

44
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,470
Don't worry. I did it without trace.

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,750
Nobody could find it's me.

46
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,800
Who is it?

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,030
Your Excellency.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Bad news. It's found out.

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
Come in.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,080
What's found out?

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,440
He knew almost everything.

52
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,160
About what?

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,030
Who?

54
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,000
What's the matter? Make it clear.

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,080
I

56
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,190
was seeing that locksmith out of the capital city.

57
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,030
Head and Master Shadow

58
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,190
saw me and blocked my way.

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,240
They asked me

60
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,240
if it's you

61
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,320
that sneaked into the imperial harem

62
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,800
last night.

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Wang Qinian, did you tell the truth?

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm not stupid.

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,160
Of course I didn't.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,030
And then?

67
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,880
Then

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,030
Master Shadow

69
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,320
gave this key to me.

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,080
This key.

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,960
Is there anything special

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
about it?

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,630
Nah. There is nothing special

74
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,800
about the key.

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,190
It's just the key to the house

76
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,160
of that locksmith.

77
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,030
The locksmith

78
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,000
that made the fake key last night?

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,630
Exactly.

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,630
Why did Shadow have the key

81
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,750
to his house?

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,630
The locksmith works for Head.

83
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,030
I really have no idea about that.

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,190
The locksmith has achieved fame

85
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,160
in the capital city for years.

86
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,550
And I've known him for a long time.

87
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,030
He's never mentioned

88
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,270
he knew Head.

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,270
Your Excellency,

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,960
you can imagine

91
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,160
how many people in the capital city

92
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,470
spy for Head.

93
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,110
This is not a key.

94
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,920
There's no such key

95
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,230
or such lock in the world.

96
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,790
The locksmith didn't know

97
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,790
I sneaked into the imperial palace.

98
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,320
Your Excellency, they're not fools.

99
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,950
You weren't at home last night

100
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,070
and someone broke into the imperial palace.

101
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,390
You also went to the locksmith

102
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,720
in nocturnal costume.

103
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,950
All this proves

104
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,880
it's you.

105
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,550
What did Chen Pingping say?

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,760
He asked me to pass on a message to you.

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
Nobody else would know

108
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,070
what he did last night.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,920
He can do whatever he wants.

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,830
I'll patch up his lies.

111
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,320
Tell Fan Xian

112
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
he can trust me.

113
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,110
It's a serious matter,

114
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,390
but he just let it go.

115
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,510
I think Head

116
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,790
is trustworthy.

117
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,790
As for what I'll do next,

118
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,510
I want to do it myself.

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll ask him for help if necessary.

120
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
Next?

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,040
What do you want to do?

122
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,480
I went to Guangxin Palace last night,

123
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,320
so I didn't have time to put the fake key back.

124
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,070
Huh?

125
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,790
What to do?

126
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,070
To put it back as soon as possible.

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I can't let others know

128
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,670
about my real intention.

129
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,510
Now that assassinators broke in last night,

130
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,320
the imperial palace will be heavily guarded today.

131
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,760
How could you go in again?

132
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll turn to someone who can do it anytime.

133
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,070
Who is it?

134
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Even if he can,

135
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,550
why should he do you a favor?

136
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Go to the imperial palace?

137
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,600
It's not hard.

138
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,760
I was brought up there.

139
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,230
It's like my home.

140
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,790
You have to find a way

141
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,830
to get into the Empress Dowager's palace.

142
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,670
No problem.

143
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,230
Her Majesty is nice to me.

144
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,760
I should go to see her.

145
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,000
You have to take me there too.

146
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,350
Okay.

147
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,480
We're engaged.

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,790
We should go there together

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
to see her.

150
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
That's not what I meant.

151
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,600
I mean

152
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,920
you take me there

153
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,320
without letting others know it's me.

154
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,880
Do you mean

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,830
you can't go to the imperial palace

156
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,110
in the name of Fan Xian?

157
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,920
In whose name will you do that?

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
A eunuch accompanying you.

159
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,160
Disguised as a eunuch.

160
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,720
A fake. I won't be a real one.

161
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,350
You don't need to explain it.

162
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,110
Is it okay?

163
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,110
Yeah. Sure.

164
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,640
Now that you want to pretend to be a eunuch,

165
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,550
you have to learn something.

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,350
Imagine I'm the Empress Dowager.

167
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,070
Support me.

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,390
How can you do it like that?

169
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,390
I'm thirsty.

170
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,640
Start again.

171
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,270
What's wrong?

172
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,670
You can't walk like that.

173
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,670
It's noisy.

174
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,920
Hold on.

175
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,350
You're a eunuch.

176
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,000
Take more, smaller steps.

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,830
Look down.

178
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,040
Your Highness, please have some tea.

179
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,040
Your Majesty.

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,230
Your Majesty, please have some tea.

181
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,270
Kneel down.

182
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,790
What?

183
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,000
Kneel down.

184
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,920
I...

185
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
Do you want to go there or not?

186
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,950
Just kidding.

187
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,510
All right.

188
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
That's all about etiquette.

189
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,230
Sit down.

190
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,790
I can take you there,

191
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
but before I do that,

192
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,710
you have to tell me

193
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,640
why you want to go there.

194
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,640
Last night,

195
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,590
I sneaked into the imperial harem

196
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,590
and stole something

197
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,550
from the Empress Dowager's palace.

198
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,670
It's something

199
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,880
closely related to

200
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,710
my mother's past.

201
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,440
So, no matter what,

202
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,320
I had to steal it yesterday

203
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,280
and I have to return it today.

204
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
It's a serious matter.

205
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,110
Why did you tell me?

206
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,470
I promised

207
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,640
I'd never lie to you.

208
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,670
You're really honest, the Poetic Genius Fan.

209
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,550
"As fall wind hugs the chill dew,

210
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
they outshine all worldly dates."

211
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,550
Is it written by you?

212
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,200
Yes.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,590
A poem is written to express the author's feelings.

214
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,520
Who are you dating?

215
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,880
You.

216
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
"This love can be waited to become a memory,

217
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,400
but at that time it was confusing and regretful."

218
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,000
Who is in your memory?

219
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,470
Why is it regretful?

220
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,590
It's also you.

221
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,710
I couldn't see you at that time,

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,710
so it was regretful.

223
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,440
"Holding hands we watch each other's falling tears.

224
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,030
With lumps in our throats, we're lost for words."

225
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,520
Whose hands were you holding?

226
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,320
Who were you crying for?

227
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,200
Still you.

228
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,880
All the poems about emotions

229
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,030
are for you.

230
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,080
All for me?

231
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,790
Yeah.

232
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,550
Really?

233
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,200
Sure.

234
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,280
There is one more.

235
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,150
One more.

236
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,710
"Ten years, dead and living dim and draw apart."

237
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,470
Is it also for me?

238
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,520
It's like I've been dead for a long time.

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,520
This is for my mom.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,350
More guards than usual.

241
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,550
Your Highness,

242
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,880
a thief broke in last night.

243
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,230
Everyone is talking about that.

244
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,760
Is it caught?

245
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,670
No.

246
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,520
It's said that guy

247
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
was here to see

248
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,080
the maidservant of the Princess Royal.

249
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,590
The one like a cold fish?

250
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,790
Exactly.

251
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,910
She's not young.

252
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah.

253
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,280
She finally came across an infatuated man.

254
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,280
A maidservant and an infatuated man.

255
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,400
It...

256
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
It's ridiculous.

257
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,790
Who knows?

258
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,110
Wan'er.

259
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,030
Your Highness.

260
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,320
I've heard Fan Xian wrote a lot of good poems

261
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,550
at the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest last night.

262
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,060
He's well-known throughout the country

263
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,000
=Consort Yi of Nanqing=
He's well-known throughout the country

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,110
=Consort Yi of Nanqing=

265
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,460
=Consort Yi of Nanqing=
as an outstanding poet.

266
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,280
as an outstanding poet.

267
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,790
The first time I saw him,

268
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,150
I found he's a lovely guy.

269
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,110
At that time, I thought he's just clever,

270
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,640
but it turns out he's of so much talent.

271
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,760
The two of you

272
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,670
are really

273
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,280
a perfect match.

274
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,590
Your Highness.

275
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,150
Where are you going?

276
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,550
Are you feeling better?

277
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,710
Thank you for your care.

278
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,320
I haven't been here for a long time.

279
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,640
I'd like to see Her Majesty.

280
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,840
What a coincidence!

281
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,550
I'm going that way too.

282
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,400
Let's go together.

283
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,840
Okay.

284
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,840
Your Majesty, let me pay my respect to you.

285
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,200
Rise.

286
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,110
You're in poor health. You don't need to kneel.

287
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,030
Your Majesty,

288
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,710
through careful treatment,

289
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,880
I've nearly recovered.

290
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,550
Even so, I don't want you to kneel down.

291
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Come over.

292
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,350
Why do you come here today?

293
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,760
I haven't seen you for a long time.

294
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,960
I miss you.

295
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,960
You've taken several servants with you.

296
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,670
I know you have a sweet tooth,

297
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,760
so I've taken

298
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,670
some cakes and cookies

299
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,960
made by myself

300
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,880
to you.

301
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,840
I've heard fleas appeared in the imperial palace recently,

302
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,550
so I've also taken some fumigants

303
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,320
to get rid of them.

304
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,960
Your love and devotion

305
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,670
are beyond price.

306
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,230
Good.

307
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,710
Accept all these.

308
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,640
Where is Eunuch Hong?

309
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,400
A thief broke in last night,

310
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,230
so I asked him to give a hand

311
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,200
to His Majesty.

312
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,760
Today is a lovely day.

313
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,590
How about

314
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,280
going to the back garden to enjoy flowers?

315
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,150
Let them stay here

316
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,550
and get rid of pests.

317
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,590
Good idea.

318
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's go.

319
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,080
Okay.

320
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,000
Okay. Let's go.

321
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,880
Today,

322
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,640
I'll stay a little longer with you in the garden.

323
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Slow down.

324
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,150
Getting fresh air

325
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,880
is good for your health.

326
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,880
Okay.

327
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,030
Eating more meat and opening windows to let fresh air in

328
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,550
are also good for your health.

329
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,030
Am I right?

330
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,440
Yeah.

331
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,400
It's a beautiful sunny day.

332
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,960
Let's have a walk.

333
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,550
Okay.

334
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,000
Your Highness, I've told him about it.

335
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,080
The Beiqi mission is going to set off.

336
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Your Highness, are you still thinking about the assassinators?

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,030
Why on earth

338
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,030
did they come here?

339
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,150
Didn't they aim to assassinate you?

340
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,550
I always think something is going wrong with it.

341
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,030
Are you sure they came from Dongyi Town?

342
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,550
Eunuch Hong fought

343
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,350
one of them

344
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,520
and recognized the mental cultivation methods of Si Gujian.

345
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,230
Really?

346
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,000
Eunuch Hong chased him for a long time

347
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,440
and fought him several times.

348
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
He couldn't have got it wrong.

349
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,000
Fought him several times?

350
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,080
Yes.

351
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,440
Chased him out of the imperial palace?

352
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,280
That's right.

353
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,470
When?

354
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,960
Eunuch Hong mentioned

355
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,470
he came across that assassinator at 11:00 p.m. or so.

356
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,320
Then he realized it was a trick
to lure the tiger form the mountain?

357
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,520
Exactly.

358
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,230
When did you find the assassinator

359
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,350
out of the imperial palace?

360
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,960
Night watchmen had sounded gongs
to make the hours at that time.

361
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,280
It was past 1:00 a.m.

362
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,550
When Eunuch Hong was lured away at 11:00 p.m.,

363
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,110
the second assassinator must've broken in.

364
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,960
If he aimed to kill me,

365
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,590
why didn't he come here

366
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,150
until 1:00 a.m.?

367
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,470
Where did he go

368
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,350
during the past two hours?

369
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,400
He just passed by my palace.

370
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,590
He aimed to do something else.

371
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,840
What does he want to do?

372
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,640
Xiaoyi,

373
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,840
ask everyone

374
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
in the imperial palace

375
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,000
to check if anything was stolen

376
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,840
or something went wrong.

377
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,670
Got it.

378
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,710
Hold on.

379
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,320
They may not listen to me.

380
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,910
Go to Her Majesty

381
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
and explain everything to her

382
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,350
so that she can give an order.

383
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,550
Got it.

384
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,150
Is it Dongyi Town or not?

385
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm going to

386
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
find out the truth soon.

387
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,590
Interesting. I'm looking forward to it.

388
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,550
It's fragrant.

389
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,710
You're more beautiful than the flower.

390
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,110
Director Yan.

391
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,230
Her Majesty is having a walk in the garden.

392
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,920
You can go there for her.

393
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,350
Someone is inside?

394
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,880
We're trying to get rid of pests through fumigation.

395
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
I mean the inner room.

396
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,230
Is anyone there?

397
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,190
No.

398
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,280
Director Yan.

399
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,040
Director Yan.

400
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,110
It's Her Majesty's palace. Don't forget the rules.

401
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,310
What's Li Yunrui investigating?

402
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,760
Her Highness worries the assassinators

403
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,520
might have other intentions.

404
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,280
Then

405
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,230
make everyone in the imperial palace

406
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,800
check their own place carefully.

407
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,590
Got it.

408
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,590
Let's go back.

409
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,830
I have to check too.

410
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,350
Got it.

411
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Slow down.

412
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,560
All of you, wait here.

413
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,880
You too.

414
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,470
Someone is hidden in Her Majesty's palace?

415
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,800
I heard the breathing,

416
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,310
but that maidservant said nobody is there.

417
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,710
Is it a man or a woman?

418
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,070
I can't tell.

419
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,880
But judging from the breathing,

420
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,590
I think it can do Kung Fu.

421
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,190
Is it Eunuch Hong?

422
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,830
If it were Eunuch Hong,

423
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,430
I couldn't have noticed it.

424
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,040
Assassinators came last night

425
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,950
and someone is hidden in Her Majesty's palace today.

426
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,310
It's more than a coincidence.

427
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,800
Are they related?

428
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,520
In this case,

429
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,280
it reminds me

430
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,760
of what's weird about the case.

431
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,560
It's indeed weird.

432
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,000
Xiaoyi,

433
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,350
is Hong Sixiang a Great Master?

434
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,950
I didn't see him fight,

435
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,400
but he's definitely more powerful than me.

436
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
You're already above the Ninth Dan,

437
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,710
so Hong Sixiang must be

438
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,470
the most mysterious Great Master.

439
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I think so.

440
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,310
The assassinator was chased by a Great Master

441
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,950
but managed to escape.

442
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,640
What kind of assassinator

443
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,760
is so capable as to do that?

444
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,800
Is it

445
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,800
Si Gujian himself?

446
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,950
It's really weird.

447
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,400
What if

448
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,830
he was lured away on purpose?

449
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,950
On purpose?

450
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,640
Why did the assassinator

451
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,710
come and go freely?

452
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,880
Why did he disappear without trace later on?

453
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,760
Why did Hong Sixiang fail to catch him

454
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,800
as a Great Master?

455
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,230
There is only one answer

456
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,350
that would make sense.

457
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,920
The two assassinators work for Her Majesty.

458
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,280
I don't know what to do to thank you.

459
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
Write me a poem.

460
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,160
Okay.

461
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,880
I need to think about it.

462
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,110
You wrote so many poems last night
even though you were drunk.

463
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,430
Why do you need to think about it today?

464
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,680
It's a different case.

465
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,350
Those poems

466
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,230
came to my mind

467
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,400
themselves.

468
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,830
I want to create one

469
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,190
for you.

470
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,190
They came to your mind themselves?

471
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,830
They just came like that.

472
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,230
I don't know where they're from.

473
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,520
Are you really an immortal

474
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,880
that's demoted to the mortal world?

475
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,920
And those poems

476
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,310
were created by you when you were in heaven?

477
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,590
Where did you hear of that?

478
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,590
Don't you know that?

479
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,760
Overnight,

480
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
it spread everywhere.

481
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,780
Chapter 54. Section 86.

482
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,350
=Xuan Jiu, Director of the Eighth Division=
Chapter 54. Section 86.

483
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,180
=Xuan Jiu, Director of the Eighth Division
of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=

484
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,560
These are all good poems.

485
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,920
But the source of some sentences

486
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,110
is unknown.

487
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,000
Take this line as an example.

488
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,230
"Yellow River pouring from heaven."

489
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,110
What is the Yellow River?

490
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,520
A river that is yellow?

491
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
And this line.

492
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,880
"There are no clouds to one who has passed Mount Wu."

493
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,310
There're numerous mountains and hills,

494
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,470
Mount Wu is the name of a mountain?

495
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,430
Your Excellency,

496
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,350
it's not hard to understand.

497
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Go ahead.

498
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,830
His Excellency Fan

499
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
is the poetic genius from heaven.

500
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,350
The unknown names of people and places

501
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,110
and literary quotations

502
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,110
are all from the fairyland.

503
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,520
The Yellow River must be a river there.

504
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,310
Does that hold water?

505
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,280
Do you think an ordinary person

506
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
could write so many excellent works

507
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,880
overnight?

508
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,160
It makes sense.

509
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,230
This line is also well written.

510
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,280
Explain it to me.

511
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,070
Are there no records

512
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,950
of these poems through the ages?

513
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,640
We've looked through all books in stock in our divisions,

514
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,110
but we've found nothing related.

515
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,470
Please give us more time

516
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,040
to look through ancient books.

517
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,800
Don't bother.

518
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,280
Get them approved

519
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,680
and printed as soon as possible.

520
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,800
Got it.

521
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,310
Wait.

522
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,280
Be careful.

523
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,590
Head,

524
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,070
it's common gossip that

525
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,000
Fan Xian is the poetic genius from heaven.

526
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,040
Shall we do something about it?

527
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,040
The literary circles of Nanqing have been declining.

528
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,760
It's time to have a poetic genius.

529
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,680
I see.

530
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,280
We'll add fuel to the flame

531
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,520
to make everyone believe it's true.

532
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,520
Go ahead.

533
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,430
Are you also reading this book?

534
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,920
Are you too?

535
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,520
Good book.

536
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,350
Good book.

537
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,560
"On war-torn land streams flow and mountains stand.

538
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,520
In vernal town grass and weeds are overgrown.

539
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Grieved over the years, flowers make us shed tears."

540
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,880
Look at this line.

541
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,230
"It's wrong to set goblets idle, in the glory of the moon."

542
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,350
Wonderful!

543
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,590
His Excellency Fan

544
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,880
proves himself to be the poetic genius.

545
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,950
Exactly.

546
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,280
With this collection of poems printed,

547
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm afraid nobody would dare to write poems again.

548
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,800
Absolutely.

549
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,950
Having the poetic genius

550
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,920
is a blessing for Nanqing.

551
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,880
To be honest,

552
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,230
I once worked with

553
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,160
His Excellency Fan.

554
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,470
At that time, I already thought

555
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,310
he's eminent

556
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,640
above all others.

557
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,070
What is it?

558
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,040
What is it?

559
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:18,710
No idea.

560
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,110
Who did it?

561
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,430
Show it to me.

562
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
There are more on the ground. Pick it up.

563
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,430
There are words on it.

564
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,520
Bro, look.

565
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,430
There are so many.

566
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,680
Who threw it?

567
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,920
Let's pick one up.

568
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,520
Let's have a look.

569
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,760
It's confusing.

570
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,520
Who wrote it?

571
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
No idea. Forget about it.

572
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
It's just a piece of paper.

573
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,350
Pretend you didn't see it.

574
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,640
Something serious is going to happen.

575
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,640
You. Stop it.

576
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,560
Go on reading.

577
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,470
...ignores social order and law and has ferocious ambition.

578
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,590
What's worse,

579
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,230
knowing some honest patriots are lurking in Beiqi,

580
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,710
Li Yunrui is so fatuous and evil-minded

581
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,000
that she forgets about national interest

582
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,950
and betrays loyal patriots to the enemy.

583
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,950
Your Highness,

584
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,070
there are even harsher words.

585
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,350
Where did you get it?

586
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,760
It was scattered in every corner of the capital city.

587
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,110
Almost everyone read it.

588
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,190
A lot of them

589
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,640
kind of believe it.

590
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,190
Who scattered them?

591
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
We have no clues.

592
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,110
It's interesting.

593
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,830
They want to get me into trouble

594
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,920
by spreading gossip.

595
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,590
Others' opinions are not important.

596
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,280
The key lies in

597
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,400
how His Majesty thinks about it.

598
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,040
The criticism is incisive.

599
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,520
Who wrote it?

600
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,430
How many people have read it?

601
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,350
I'm afraid everyone has.

602
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,280
Nowadays,

603
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,430
it's widely discussed among people.

604
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,560
They're talking about

605
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,800
the Princess Royal's love affair with Zhuang Mohan.

606
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,950
Ridiculous.

607
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,560
Your Majesty,

608
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,310
is it true that the Princess Royal

609
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,640
betrayed Yan Bingyun?

610
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,710
Why do you ask me?

611
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,800
Isn't it the Investigator's Office's duty?

612
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,280
Shall we find the truth out?

613
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,710
It has provoked much discussion.

614
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,430
It's better to put an end to it.

615
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,920
Your Majesty, do you need an end to it or

616
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,710
the truth?

617
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,230
How dare you?

618
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,710
I can punish you for your great disrespect.

619
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,110
I'll accept the punishment.

620
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't mind if you want to die.

621
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,830
You can leave.

622
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,470
Your Excellency.

623
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,920
Did you read this?

624
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,430
The Princess Royal colluded with Beiqi?

625
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,760
She betrayed Bingyun?

626
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,710
Where did you get it?

627
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,430
It can be found everywhere on the streets.

628
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,560
Who distributed it?

629
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,640
Heaven knows.

630
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,280
Let me make it clear.

631
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,280
If my son was arrested because of exposing his identity,

632
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,760
I'll have nothing to complain about.

633
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,710
But if it's because

634
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,950
someone in Nanqing played a trick,

635
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,710
I won't leave it at that.

636
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,950
Why didn't you tell Head?

637
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,680
I don't trust him.

638
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,110
Few guys know that

639
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,640
Bingyun is in Beiqi.

640
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,830
Do you suspect

641
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,310
it's Head that betrayed him?

642
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,110
He wants to promote Fan Xian.

643
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,160
Among the younger generation,

644
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,470
my son is the biggest rival

645
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,830
of Fan Xian.

646
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,430
Let's update each other

647
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,710
on anything new.

648
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,830
We're making a big deal out of it.

649
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,640
I'd like to see how Li Yunrui would end up.

650
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,350
Uncle, I'm lucky to have you.

651
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,040
Nobody else could have

652
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,680
scattered them all over the city

653
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,800
without letting others know.

654
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,920
Is it of help?

655
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,310
Uncle, gossip is a fearful thing.

656
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,830
Besides, this is true.

657
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,230
Li Yunrui can't afford to be investigated.

658
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,040
Do you know

659
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,640
what's best about this method?

660
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,350
No.

661
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,470
Do you want to know?

662
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,760
No.

663
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,710
I won't bother to ask you any questions.

664
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,070
What's best about it is that

665
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,040
nobody could find out it's me behind this.

666
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,070
So, I can stay out of it

667
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,590
and watch the show.

668
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,640
It's me, Chen Pingping.

669
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,830
Why are you here?

670
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
To see you.

671
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,760
Is Wuzhu not here?

672
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,190
What's the matter?

673
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,430
Well.

674
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,350
I've read it.

675
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,350
It's hard to imagine

676
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,230
the Princess Royal

677
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,310
has a love affair

678
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,800
with such an old man.

679
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,110
It's you that did it.

680
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,280
You have no evidence.

681
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,430
Please don't say that.

682
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,800
The evidence is what you're holding in your hand.

683
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,070
They're scattered everywhere in the capital city.

684
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,590
I had a few copies taken back.

685
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,640
Check it out.

686
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,710
The paper is made from blue sandalwood.

687
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,560
Due to different abilities to absorb water,

688
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,710
such paper can be classified into

689
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,040
raw paper, ripe paper

690
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,230
and half-ripe paper.

691
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,870
Head,

692
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,430
this is half-ripe paper.

693
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,870
A lot of the bark of blue sandalwood
has been used, so it's also called "Jingpi".

694
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,800
It has two layers in thickness.

695
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,430
Paper curtains with double silk lines
are used to form the grain pattern.

696
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,670
In addition to straws,

697
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
mulberry and hemp are also used as auxiliary material.

698
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,360
It's produced in Hexi Circuit.

699
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,560
Such paper is not of high quality,

700
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,910
so it's seldom used in the capital city.

701
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,000
Head,

702
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,600
are there a large number of copies?

703
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
They can be found everywhere in the capital city.

704
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,080
Only one place

705
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,080
has such a large amount of stock.

706
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,760
In the whole capital,

707
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,190
only Danbo Bookstore

708
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,840
has purchased such paper.

709
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,280
You're the one behind this.

710
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,870
Are you short of money

711
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,870
so that you purchased such poor quality products?

712
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,520
Fan Sizhe is responsible for this.

713
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,840
He'd save every penny he can.

714
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,470
Among the eight divisions of the Investigator's Office,

715
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,040
I've paid least attention to

716
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,840
the Eighth Division.

717
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,910
Unbelievable.

718
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
The Investigator's Office was set up by your mother.

719
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,150
Don't look down upon it.

720
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,760
Did many people know about it?

721
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,320
Nobody did. I got it fixed.

722
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,630
Is it true or false?

723
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,870
The love affair part is false,

724
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,390
but the betrayal part is true.

725
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,280
How did you know that?

726
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,080
I heard it with my own ears.

727
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,630
You heard it when you sneaked
into the imperial harem that night.

728
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,950
Do you want to deal with the Princess Royal?

729
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,910
She wants to kill me.

730
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,910
I can't sit still waiting for my death, right?

731
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,320
Only spreading gossip is not enough.

732
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,950
You have to provide evidence.

733
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,760
I planned to take the second step.

734
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,630
I think

735
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,840
there is someone who's of use.

736
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,710
Guo Youzhi, Minister of the Board of Rites.

737
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,710
How did you know that?

738
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,190
I've heard what happened at the banquet that night.

739
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,840
I'll be here today.

740
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,120
I'll watch you hit rock bottom and ruin your name

741
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
with my own eyes.

742
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,520
My son is so rude.

743
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,950
Your Excellency Fan, please forgive him.

744
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,600
Who are you?

745
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,630
This is Guo Youzhi,

746
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,040
Minister of the Board of Rites.

747
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,600
By making up such an absurd story,
he lied to Your Majesty.

748
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Your Majesty, I beg you to punish him!

749
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,040
According to Guo Baokun,

750
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,630
he knew that

751
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,910
Zhuang Mohan made a false charge.

752
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,760
If the Princess Royal

753
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,870
wants to contact Zhuang Mohan,

754
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,760
there must be an official who acts as an intermediary.

755
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,320
Guo Baokun is not qualified,

756
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,430
so it must be his father,

757
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,910
Guo Youzhi.

758
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,560
It turns out you also thought of it.

759
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,360
I've paid much attention to your thing.

760
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,800
But it's just a guess.

761
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,870
I've got an idea

762
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,280
to prove Zhuang Mohan

763
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,950
has collided with Guo Youzhi.

764
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,000
You can take advantage of
Zhuang Mohan's disappearance

765
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,800
upon his first arrival in the capital city.

766
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,950
You also knew that?

767
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,430
Judging from the current situation,

768
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,600
Zhuang Mohan

769
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,040
did meet the Princess Royal.

770
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,870
Someone must have done something

771
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,080
to deceive the public.

772
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,910
That's why he was taken away from his residence.

773
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,910
We can try to find out

774
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,190
who Zhuang Mohan met that day.

775
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,080
I've done that.

776
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,080
Guo Youzhi was one of them.

777
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,120
You must also have guessed

778
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,520
what I'd say next.

779
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,230
Let me think about it.

780
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,910
I'll think about it.

781
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,670
These are still not enough.

782
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,000
We need witnesses.

783
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,120
Did you get one?

784
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,120
We caught his carter who confessed everything.

785
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,080
He said he took Zhuang Mohan away

786
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,360
secretly that night

787
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,390
and someone picked him up

788
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,910
at the imperial harem.

789
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,600
What should be done has been done.

790
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,670
What do you want to do next?

791
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,670
That's what I want to ask you.

792
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,320
I want to drive Li Yunrui

793
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,950
out of the capital city.

794
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,560
Look at it yourself.

795
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,180
=Carter confessed that it's Guo Youzhi,
Minister of the Board of Rites who took Zhuang Mohan away...=

796
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,840
Guo Youzhi is indeed one of my followers.

797
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,950
It's also true

798
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,150
I met Zhuang Mohan.

799
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,360
Did you confess your crime?

800
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,710
Zhuang Mohan is a literary giant.

801
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,360
I had some questions about
the ancient prose I was reading,

802
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,760
so I invited him to my place

803
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,670
to consult him.

804
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,280
As for betraying Yan Bingyun,

805
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,840
it's sheer nonsense.

806
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,360
Reading ancient prose?

807
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,230
I'm sure you can find out the truth.

808
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,000
Do you have any question?

809
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Let's forget about

810
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,630
the ancient prose for a while.

811
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,600
The imperial harem should not meddle in politics,

812
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,470
but Her Highness won over Guo Youzhi in private,

813
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,560
which proves she ganged up for selfish interests.

814
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,120
Are you convinced?

815
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,600
Now that Head said so,

816
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
of course I'm convinced.

817
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,710
What should we do?

818
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,120
As a court official,

819
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,520
Guo Youzhi ganged up with the imperial harem.

820
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,840
He should be turned over
to the Ministry of Penalty according to law.

821
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Won't you even try to protect your follower?

822
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,910
The law is the law.

823
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,390
Guo Youzhi brought it on himself.

824
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,910
You've proved yourself to be one of the royal family.

825
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,360
Quick. Quick!

826
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,710
Dad!

827
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,630
Master.

828
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,950
Dad!

829
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,190
Let me go over.

830
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
My dad serves as Board of Rites.

831
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,800
He's an official of standard class, second rank.

832
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,150
The Ministry of Penalty has no right to arrest him.

833
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,840
Dad! Dad!

834
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,630
Master.

835
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,390
How dare you?

836
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,120
I'll go to His Majesty and complain.

837
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,000
Step aside.

838
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,800
Master.

839
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,360
Dad.

840
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,120
Master.

841
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,710
Dad. Dad.

842
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,390
Loosen your grip. Go away.

843
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,630
Dad! Dad! Dad!

844
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,360
Dad. Loosen your grip.

845
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,670
-Let me say something to him. -Let go of me.

846
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,230
I won't make things difficult for you.

847
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,040
Dad! Dad!

848
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,840
Let go of me!

849
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,040
Dad! Dad!

850
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,760
Dad.

851
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,150
I have to save you.

852
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,600
Alright. It's of no use.

853
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Can't you see it?

854
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,760
Besides guys from the Ministry of Penalty,

855
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,120
some imperial guards are also here.

856
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,280
You still don't understand?

857
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,190
They did it by His Majesty's order.

858
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,760
How could it be like this?

859
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,870
I shouldn't have let you

860
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,230
go to the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest that day.

861
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,080
I should have been more careful.

862
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,190
I shouldn't have told you about that thing.

863
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,840
At the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest...

864
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,190
You shouldn't have said those words to Fan Xian.

865
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,800
It wouldn't matter if he really lost his reputation,

866
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,360
but now he's acclaimed as the poetic genius.

867
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,600
I knew

868
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,470
it would happen sooner or later.

869
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,360
Dad. It's my fault.

870
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,630
I don't blame you. It's my fault.

871
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,150
Kun'er, from now on,

872
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,430
you have to make a clean break with me.

873
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,560
Remember.

874
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,040
Try your best to send in memorials

875
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,600
to attack me and abuse me.

876
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,360
Say that I have wild ambition

877
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,670
and you can't bear it anymore.

878
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,670
Got it?

879
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,230
No.

880
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,120
Only in this way

881
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,910
will you not get caught in trouble.

882
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,840
No! No!

883
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,520
I often criticize you,

884
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,630
but from the bottom of my heart,

885
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,910
I hope to see you

886
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,870
rise in the official world and get married.

887
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,670
I want to protect you all the way,

888
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,430
but I can't do it anymore.

889
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,300
In the river of history,

890
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,500
time goes round and round.

891
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,860
Memories about the former and present lives

892
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,740
join each other in an endless way.

893
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,340
In the long drunken Milky Way,

894
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,060
one season follows another in a flash,

895
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,260
and the wild geese are flying south.

896
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,180
I just can't give up

897
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,180
to be with you for my whole life.

898
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,460
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

899
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,260
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

900
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,140
Year after year in the wandering,

901
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,700
I count the remaining years.

902
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,900
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

903
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,460
even though we have ended up the destiny,

904
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,140
I never feel regretful.

905
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,100
In such a chaotic world,

906
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,860
I still miss you as ever.

907
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,500
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

908
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,220
With a gentle heart,

909
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,780
I cherish our remaining years.

910
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,620
Even though we have to go through

911
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,580
all the hardships along the journey,

912
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:27,900
you always stay by my side,

913
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,660
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

914
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,580
Year after year in the wandering,

915
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,940
I count the remaining years.

916
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,300
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

917
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,100
even though we end up the destiny,

918
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,540
I never feel regretful.

919
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,460
In such a chaotic world,

920
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,420
I still miss you as ever.

921
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,100
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

922
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,860
With a gentle heart,

923
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,260
I cherish our remaining years.

924
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,060
Even though we have to go through

925
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,220
all the hardships along the journey,

926
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:08,500
you always stay by my side...
