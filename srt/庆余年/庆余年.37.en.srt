1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 37

16
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,000
If you don't hide,

17
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,760
with more rotten vegetables and worn-out shoes coming,

18
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,550
it's not so honorable, either.

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,360
So I'll dishonor

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,440
my country either way.

21
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,630
I just can't quell the public anger.

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,910
You're really good.

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
You misunderstood me.

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,230
Wait!

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,310
Gao.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,510
There's a long roll of cloth on the carriage

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,630
which carries cargoes.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,550
Bring it to me.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,630
Yes, Your Excellency.

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,360
Your Excellency.

31
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,550
Wang, drive steadily.

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,270
I got it.

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,440
Everyone,

34
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,470
this is the battle flag of the seventh battalion of

35
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,600
our frontier forces.

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,360
For the border war,

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
this is the first flag

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,190
put on

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,390
your territory.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,360
Your Excellency,

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
it's dangerous to incur the public anger.

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,110
If you do so, I can't help you.

43
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,600
Gao,

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,360
borrow me your sword.

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,390
OK.

46
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,390
Now,

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,550
this battle flag will also

48
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,520
be taken into your imperial palace.

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,470
This can make a much-told story.

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,630
Only the weak keep talking.

51
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,470
Whoever with courage and uprightness

52
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,000
should knock me down

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,390
and break the flagpole.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
However,

55
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,630
I'm afraid there's no such man

56
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,000
in Beiqi anymore.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,270
I'm Zhao Zhelin from Huxiao Battalion

58
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,080
of Palace Guards.

59
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,040
Next.

60
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,230
Your Majesty,

61
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,720
news comes from palace guards that

62
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,320
Fan Xian, the Nanqing envoy,

63
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,600
stands on the carriage roof

64
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
and provokes the public by putting on the battle flag.

65
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,950
He's so arrogant and rebellious!

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,350
Your Majesty, please issue

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,760
an imperial edict to reprimand him!

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
Your Majesty,

69
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,670
an urgent report from the border says that

70
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,000
all the divisions of Nanqing's border forces

71
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,440
have moved forward 15 km at the same time,

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,230
and stopped right on the border line.

73
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,880
Haven't we reached an agreement in the peace talk?

74
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,200
If the war is restarted, the common people will suffer.

75
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,510
Given that the state treasury is empty,
we can't afford another war.

76
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,070
Your Majesty,

77
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,790
news comes from Ministry of War that

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
with the Nanqing frontier forces pressing on to the border,

79
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,480
Beiqi is thrown into a panic.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,440
They avoid us most of the time.

81
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,760
There's no dispute so far.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,640
Tell the frontier forces

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,160
to stay where they are.

84
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,550
Don't charge or retreat.

85
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,830
Then Beiqi will tremble with fear.

86
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,110
According to time,

87
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
Fan Xian should have arrived

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,880
in the capital of Beiqi.

89
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,320
He should if everything goes well.

90
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,440
Will he cause any trouble?

91
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,230
Your Majesty, are the frontier forces

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,760
pressing on to the border for Fan Xian?

93
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,480
He's the envoy of Nanqing.

94
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,320
Even if he causes any trouble,

95
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,510
there will be millions of frontier soldiers backing him up.

96
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,640
Well done! Good work!

97
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,510
Your Excellency, do you want a try?

98
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,880
Whoever is shameless

99
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,440
can make a sneak attack.

100
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,830
I'll take it.

101
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,320
Your Excellency, watch out!

102
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,220
=He Daoren, Ninth Dan martial arts master of Beiqi=

103
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,510
He Daoren.

104
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,830
The Investigator's Office has his records.
He's a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

105
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,950
Even a Ninth Dan martial arts master dares to block my way.

106
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,950
Your Excellency,

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,950
that Chen Jushu you killed

108
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,920
is his apprentice.

109
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,790
Are you here to avenge your apprentice's death?

110
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,600
Your Excellency!

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
You have profound vitality Qi.

112
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,440
Next round, I'll kill you with my sword.

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
How can you point your sword at the envoy?

114
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,110
Where are your manners?

115
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,040
Your Excellency,

116
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,070
the imperial palace is right ahead.

117
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,950
By making such provocation,

118
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,280
do you want to restart the war?

119
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Let's go.

120
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm really scared.

121
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,080
Will anyone throw things at me again?

122
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,110
Your Excellency,

123
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,400
you may stay here for a moment.

124
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,150
I'll go ahead to get things ready.

125
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,350
Your Excellency, please go ahead.

126
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,030
Your Excellency, have you reached the Ninth Dan?

127
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,670
You are injured!

128
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,350
I'm fine.

129
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,880
So you're close to the Ninth Dan!

130
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,280
I've been practicing Overbearing Vitality Qi.

131
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,760
What a cool name!

132
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,320
It's special for its strong power.

133
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,910
By fighting with Shangshan Hu

134
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,000
and Haitang Duoduo along the way,

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,880
I've made a breakthrough.

136
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,000
Competing solely on the strength of vitality Qi,

137
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,150
I can fight a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

138
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,080
But I'm far behind in terms of subtle control.

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,470
Your Excellency, no wonder

140
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,080
you put the flag on the carriage roof.

141
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,710
Why?

142
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,000
I stood on the carriage roof

143
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,790
to avoid bodily movements.

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,030
If He Daoren

145
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,030
wanted to knock me down,

146
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,030
he had to go up.

147
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,320
Competing solely on the strength of vitality Qi,

148
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,710
it's to my advantage.

149
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,960
If He Daoren attacked me with his sword again,

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,960
I would have to step aside,

151
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,000
or I would be severely injured.

152
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,710
Then why did Shen Zhong

153
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
stop him just now?

154
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm the envoy of Nanqing.

155
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,840
If anything bad happens to me, there'll be a war.

156
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,590
Now Beiqi can't afford

157
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,550
another war.

158
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,840
Shen Zhong uses Beiqi people to humiliate me

159
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,110
so as to undermine the morale of our mission.

160
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,230
But he dares not

161
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,960
hurt me.

162
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,880
At least,

163
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
I can't be hurt under his protection.

164
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,710
So we're

165
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,710
in an invincible position.

166
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,000
On this occasion,

167
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,110
I'm afraid it might be difficult

168
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,760
to fulfill our task this time.

169
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,110
It's so big here.

170
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,520
Well, guys,

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,590
what do you think?

172
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,640
It's solemn and magnificent.

173
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,790
Beiqi is the most orthodox of all countries.

174
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,760
Young and superficial as Nanqing is,

175
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,960
you even copied our imperial palace.

176
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,110
Though young and superficial, we actually won the war.

177
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,640
Your Excellency, you have a sharp tongue.

178
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,790
It's no worse than your martial arts skills.

179
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,520
Your Excellency, I've learned that from you.

180
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,280
Let's go.

181
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,760
His Majesty is waiting for us.

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,110
Let's go.

183
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,030
Your Excellency.

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,590
His Majesty only wants to see you.

185
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,520
Let's go.

186
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,880
The envoy of Nanqing is here.

187
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,760
Nanqing envoy Fan Xian

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,030
pays respects to Your Majesty of Beiqi.

189
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,150
I hereby present the credentials

190
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,000
personally drafted by His Majesty of Nanqing.

191
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,340
=Zhan Doudou, Emperor of Beiqi=

192
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,710
Mr. Fan, which chapter of your book

193
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,440
have you finished lately?

194
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,590
That's all for today.

195
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,320
Ministers, you may leave.

196
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,760
Mr. Fan,

198
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,000
you should stay

199
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,550
and talk with me.

200
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,080
You can come up.

201
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Wang, it seems that the officials are all out.

202
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,350
Your Excellency!

203
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,350
Where's His Excellency?

204
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,880
What has he done?

205
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,200
Man and woman falling in love with each other,

206
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,110
it's human nature.

207
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,590
What are you talking about?

208
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,150
What are you asking about?

209
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,760
Why did His Majesty call him Mr. Fan?

210
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Mr. Fan?

211
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,200
Does His Majesty of Beiqi

212
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
usually call his ministers that way?

213
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,520
Never.

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,910
Then why?

215
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,550
Then why?

216
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,320
How could I know?

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Neither could us!

218
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,470
Maybe, His Majesty of your country

219
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,280
is courteous to men of talents.

220
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,230
But he's too courteous.

221
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,640
Mother,

222
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,670
I'm so happy to see Fan Xian

223
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,030
that I forgot about diplomatic etiquette.

224
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,030
So happy?

225
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,710
Please forgive me.

226
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
=Empress Dowager of Beiqi=

227
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,220
=Haitang Duoduo, Saintess of Beiqi=

228
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,150
Are you the poetic genius of Nanqing?

229
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm too embarrassed

230
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,440
to bear the title.

231
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,760
Fan Xian pays respects to Your Majesty the Empress Dowager.

232
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,790
Rise.

233
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,760
His Majesty loves your poems.

234
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,320
Your Majesty, what do you want to talk with him?

235
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,670
Just talk about poems casually.

236
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,110
Please allow us.

237
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
You're the emperor.

238
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,670
You can make the call.

239
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,080
If you want to talk poems with him,

240
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,790
just go ahead.

241
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,550
The hall is too majestic. It's not a place to talk.

242
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,910
I'd like to go out for a walk with Fan Xian.

243
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,840
Mother, you must be tired after
handling all the political affairs.

244
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,470
You'd better go back to your palace for a rest.

245
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,760
Is the hall too majestic,

246
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,400
or am I too majestic?

247
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,760
Mother, it's known to the world that

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,470
you're elegant and kind.

249
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,550
Well then.

250
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,440
Let me walk

251
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,590
with you.

252
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,110
Mother, you must be tired. How dare I bother you?

253
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,400
That being said,

254
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,640
I might as well go back to my palace.

255
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,230
Your Auntie is here.

256
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,110
If you want to talk casually,

257
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,950
your Auntie can keep you company.

258
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,880
Mother, see you.

259
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,800
Auntie, when did you get back to Shangjing?

260
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,190
I got back yesterday.

261
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,040
My teacher is afraid there might be too
many villains in the imperial palace,

262
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,800
so he sends me here.

263
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,950
Villains?

264
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,830
Yes, there are all kinds of villains in the world.

265
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,710
Some are cunning and deceitful,

266
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,230
some are shameless and insidious,

267
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,470
and some may even drug others.

268
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,760
It's impossible to guard against them.

269
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Let's have a rest here.

270
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,400
Holding on to the balustrade clean,

271
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,070
I feel the chill of the wind blowing watery smoke onto my face.

272
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,230
Good!

273
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,040
I sing aloud dispersing the fleeting clouds apace.

274
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,350
Excellent! Wonderful!

275
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,000
There are many people trying to flatter me.

276
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,520
But Fan Xian, you're the first one

277
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,470
to flatter me in a careless way.

278
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm really sorry.

279
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,430
Auntie, you're seldom here.

280
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,350
Now that you're here,

281
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,400
you can appreciate the scenery.

282
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,350
The imperial palace is so beautiful

283
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,470
that I never thought of

284
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,680
taking a walk outside the palace walls.

285
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,310
Mr. Fan,

286
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,470
how do you like the scenery here?

287
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,520
Good.

288
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,110
What is good?

289
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,590
There are trees.

290
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,430
You're so good at making compliments.

291
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,280
Mr. Fan, do you know

292
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,830
why I ask you to stay?

293
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,470
Your Majesty, please tell me.

294
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,920
There're two reasons.

295
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,560
Firstly,

296
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
I love your talent in literature.

297
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,400
I can hardly bear to put down the Red Mansions

298
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,830
written by you under a pseudonym.

299
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,310
However, it does take a long time

300
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,000
for you to release the new chapter.

301
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,520
I'll try my best to finish it.

302
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,160
Secondly, it's your poem collection.

303
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,520
You actually composed so many marvelous poems overnight.

304
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,040
Once it's released,

305
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,000
even I dare not compose any poems.

306
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,040
I'm so flattered,

307
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,160
but your Majesty's poem is really good.

308
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,520
Take a seat.

309
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,760
Actually, there's another reason.

310
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,710
Mr. Fan, you went all the way up north.

311
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,000
How do you like the scenery in Beiqi?

312
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,350
The scenery is picturesque and the land
is endowed with nature's treasures.

313
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,470
How is it compared to Nanqing?

314
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,190
It's far better.

315
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,950
The palace walls of Nanqing

316
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,040
are much lower

317
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,800
and closer to ditches,

318
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,830
which smell like horse urine.

319
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,590
When Auntie said you're a rascal,

320
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I didn't believe her.

321
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
Today by meeting you in person, I think she's right about you.

322
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,400
It should be the first time

323
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,160
for me to meet your Auntie.

324
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,520
How could she make such a comment?

325
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,350
You really haven't met her before?

326
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
No.

327
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,680
She's Haitang. Do you remember?

328
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,920
So she's Miss Haitang,

329
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,950
the Beiqi Saintess.

330
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,590
I've heard so much of you!

331
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,400
In my opinion, Mr. Fan,

332
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,560
you must have a poor memory.

333
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,590
It really is my first time

334
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,800
to meet her.

335
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,520
How could you forget your recent fight in the stone forest?

336
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,920
You drugged her, remember?

337
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,350
How do you...

338
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,560
You also told her that

339
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,160
you would help her and my mother

340
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,590
take over power from me.

341
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,350
To help you and the Empress Dowager

342
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,280
take over power from your little emperor.

343
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,680
Who told you I'm with the Empress Dowager.

344
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,710
Your teacher Ku He is the Imperial Tutor.

345
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,760
He certainly has to take side.

346
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,160
One force is led by the little emperor.
One force is led by the Empress Dowager.

347
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,160
And the other is led by Shangshan Hu,

348
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,310
which remains neutral.

349
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,560
Shangshan Hu wants to save Xiao En,

350
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,680
while you want to kill him.

351
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,190
You're certainly not on the same side.

352
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,800
I could also be a follower of His Majesty.

353
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,160
You thought I wouldn't order Auntie

354
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,560
to attack in Nanqing,

355
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,470
so you believed she's with my mother.

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,680
I cry, "Can't you see? Can't you see?

357
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,470
The green leaves are fresh but the red flowers are fading!"

358
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,830
What a wonderful poem!

359
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,920
So you're not...

360
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,110
You actually guessed wrong.

361
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,760
You seem to serve the Empress Dowager, but...

362
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,520
But she's actually on my side.

363
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,800
Does anyone else know about this?

364
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,040
In the imperial palace,

365
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,280
no one knows but the three of us.

366
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,560
His Majesty only loves

367
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,920
Fan Xian's literary talent,

368
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,520
so he keeps Fan Xian for a casual talk.

369
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,280
No need to be worried.

370
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,350
But Fan Xian is also

371
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,470
the Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

372
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,470
He's very resourceful.

373
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,070
If he meets alone with His Majesty,

374
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm afraid...

375
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,350
I asked Haitang to keep them company.

376
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,760
If the Saintess is with them,

377
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,800
it should be fine.

378
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,880
With Haitang by their side,

379
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,760
His Majesty won't be able

380
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,830
to tell Fan Xian any secret.

381
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,590
Mr. Fan, are you nervous?

382
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,000
By telling me such an important secret,

383
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm afraid Your Majesty might kill me next.

384
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,350
If I kill you,

385
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,070
who can finish writing the Red Mansions?

386
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
If you have any question, just feel free to ask.

387
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,160
Your Majesty, did you give the order

388
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,190
to kill Xiao En?

389
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,160
What about Si Lili then?

390
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,190
I didn't give the order.

391
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,950
That's an order from my teacher.

392
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,160
His Majesty has nothing to do with it.

393
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,280
Your relationship network in Beiqi is really complicated.

394
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,470
Indeed!

395
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,280
Your Majesty, you told me

396
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,950
the secret,

397
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,950
yet you spare my life.

398
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,830
What are you up to?

399
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,280
Don't you want to find an ally?

400
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,680
You can help anyone.

401
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,110
Why not help me?

402
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,070
Your Majesty, what can I do for you?

403
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,830
Shen Zhong

404
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,160
enjoys great power and has followers everywhere.

405
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,160
Yet he's extremely loyal to my mother.

406
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,280
I remember that Shen Zhong

407
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,310
killed a mammy from the imperial palace

408
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,190
at the border.

409
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,800
She was an old servant of the Empress Dowager of your country.

410
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,640
How can he be called loyal?

411
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,710
I've figured it out.

412
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,920
The family of the mammy

413
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,000
have received a large sum of money recently.

414
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,190
Tracing the source, it was paid

415
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,040
by Ceremonial Propriety Division.

416
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,190
His Majesty bought her over?

417
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,640
We should get rid of her.

418
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Though His Majesty is young,

419
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,350
he's really shrewd and deep.

420
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,230
Why can't he see that

421
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,070
everything I've done

422
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,590
is for protecting Beiqi?

423
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,920
Your Majesty, you're definitely doing everything for the country.

424
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,350
By killing her,

425
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,160
His Majesty won't be happy.

426
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,400
I can't help with that.

427
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,760
I only want to clean up

428
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,680
the traitors around Your Majesty.

429
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,430
Then why not

430
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,640
dismiss him from his post?

431
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,920
By dismissing him, the whole situation will be affected.

432
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,680
Shen Zhong has many connections,

433
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,430
and he is shielded by my mother.

434
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,710
It's by no means easy.

435
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,430
Then how will I be able to help?

436
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,560
Mr. Fan, you protected the battle flag

437
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,470
all the way into the imperial palace with only one sword.

438
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,640
You also killed Cheng Jushu

439
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,830
in the capital city of Nanqing.

440
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,470
Skilled as you are, it won't be difficult

441
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,830
for you to kill Shen Zhong, right?

442
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,590
Miss Haitang is exceptionally good at martial arts.

443
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,000
She is a better killer than I am.

444
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,880
If Auntie kills him,

445
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,640
will my mother still believe her?

446
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,880
Your Majesty, don't you have

447
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,070
other martial arts masters at your command?

448
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,560
Shen Zhong is thoroughly

449
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,880
familiar with my men.

450
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,160
Whenever they move, he'll be vigilant right away.

451
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,560
I see.

452
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,280
So I'm the best choice.

453
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,710
I'm from Nanqing.

454
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,640
If Shen Zhong is killed by me,

455
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,950
no one will suspect Your Majesty.

456
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,640
That's right.

457
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,470
Then by cutting off my head in public,

458
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,880
Your Majesty can draw people over to your side,

459
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,000
and I will die in a strange land.

460
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,040
What a good story of

461
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,520
helping each other!

462
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Mr. Fan, are you refusing my offer?

463
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,590
Why should I take the risk?

464
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,310
Why do you come to Beiqi?

465
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,430
To return Xiao En and take Yan Bingyun back.

466
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,470
Yan Bingyun is in Shen Zhong's hands.

467
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,800
But he will release Yan Bingyun sooner or later.

468
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,950
Even the Empress Dowager of your country

469
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,400
does not want another war, right?

470
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,640
Yan Bingyun will be released,

471
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,950
but it's hard to tell when.

472
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,070
Then how could he

473
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,190
keep me in Shangjing?

474
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,760
You should ask him about that.

475
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,470
Fine, I'll leave and ask him now.

476
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,400
Your Majesty, if you don't want to kill me,

477
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,310
I'll leave now.

478
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,950
Auntie,

479
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
escort Mr. Fan out for me.

480
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,760
Your Majesty, I bid you farewell.

481
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,070
We'll meet again.

482
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,470
What's so funny?

483
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,160
I remember that

484
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,230
when country women feel lazy,

485
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,430
they may walk like this.

486
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,590
I'm also lazy. Is that funny?

487
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,680
I love your posture.

488
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,640
If I'm not honest, I'll be condemned by the God.

489
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,160
I thought Your Majesty

490
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,110
wouldn't let me leave.

491
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,950
Why?

492
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Because I've known your secret.

493
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
He loves your book,

494
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,800
so he won't kill you.

495
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,800
Isn't that an excuse?

496
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,520
No.

497
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,400
You talk less than before.

498
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,880
Weren't it for the same walking posture,

499
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,800
I wouldn't recognize you.

500
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,560
I'm the Saintess.

501
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,560
How could I be saint if I talk too much?

502
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,430
Do you care about others' opinions?

503
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,190
My teacher asks me to behave like

504
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,190
a Saintess in the imperial palace,

505
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,040
so I don't like to come here.

506
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,680
When you're with me,

507
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,520
you don't have to restrain yourself.

508
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,190
Are we friends?

509
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,800
You even drugged me!

510
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,000
If you really mind it so much,

511
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,920
you can also drug me.

512
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,400
Yes, I can.

513
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,470
There aren't many drugs in the world

514
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,280
which can affect me.

515
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,190
Just wait. I'll have a try.

516
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,680
Then you should hurry up.

517
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,920
I'll go back to Nanqing

518
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,880
right after getting Yan Bingyun.

519
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,400
His Majesty said

520
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,640
you won't be able to go back for the moment.

521
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,350
Shen Zhong won't give Yan Bingyun

522
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,190
to you easily.

523
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,110
Your Majesty is too young

524
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,230
to understand political affairs.

525
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,070
If he wants to keep me in Shangjing,

526
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,190
he has to find an excuse.

527
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,160
He can't keep me by force.

528
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,590
That excuse should be sensible

529
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,110
and acceptable to both our countries.

530
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,190
It's not easy

531
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,880
to find such an excuse.

532
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,280
What did you say?

533
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,680
Our Empress Dowager's birthday is around the corner.

534
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,680
Your Excellency, you can take the chance and stay a little longer

535
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,880
to congratulate Her Majesty,

536
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,590
thus promoting the friendship between our courtiers.

537
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,920
I'm here with a task.

538
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,680
It's approved by your country.

539
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,040
By whom?

540
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,070
Wait a moment.

541
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,070
Officials,

542
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,950
you can go back to your residence first

543
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,280
with other mission members.

544
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,880
I'll take a walk with His Excellency.

545
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,430
Your Majesty, Minister Fan is here.

546
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,190
Let him in.

547
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,350
What's up, Head Chen?

548
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,880
Did you know in advance that I would come and visit?

549
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,160
How could I know that?

550
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,310
It's prepared by me.

551
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,110
Your Majesty,

552
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,680
Beiqi wants to keep Fan Xian there.

553
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,310
They're obviously up to something.

554
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,710
The longer he stays in the capital of

555
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,880
the enemy country, the more risky it'll be.

556
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,760
How could you grant their request?

557
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,430
Sit down and fish with me.

558
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,310
To keep the mission,

559
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,880
we certainly have to gain approval

560
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,800
from your emperor.

561
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Your Excellency, do you want to defy the imperial order?

562
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,280
If so, you won't be able to

563
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,760
stay in Nanqing anymore,

564
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,230
please feel free to

565
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,190
join us in Beiqi anytime.

566
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,880
You're welcome to forsake darkness for light.

567
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,590
I can stay for the birthday,

568
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,310
but you should let me

569
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,160
take back Yan Bingyun first.

570
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,040
Let's talk about hostage exchange till

571
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,710
you're heading back to Nanqing.

572
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,470
Your Excellency, do you want to detain him?

573
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,400
I still have some questions for him.

574
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,040
Your Excellency, please wait a little longer.

575
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Then let me see him first.

576
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,880
Fine.

577
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,470
I'll arrange it for you gradually.

578
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,830
When can I see him?

579
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,680
No hurry. The procedures are complicated.

580
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,000
Your Excellency, you should wait patiently.

581
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,680
What if I want to see him now?

582
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,640
Then Your Excellency,

583
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,760
you'd better look for him yourself.

584
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,230
Don't push! Don't push! Listen to me!

585
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,400
His Excellency is not here.

586
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,760
He's really not here!

587
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,160
Your Excellency, what does that mean?

588
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,230
Throwing a sword at someone's feet

589
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,800
is a custom of Beiqi.

590
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,950
It means challenging the mission for a fight.

591
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,310
Your Excellency, word has spread so fast

592
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,310
that you protected the battle flag with only one sword.

593
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,470
Now those who want to challenge you

594
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,830
are coming one after another.

595
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,430
Your Excellency, take care. See you.

596
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,310
So you're Fan Xian.

597
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,000
I want to challenge you.

598
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,710
Your Excellency, if we don't fight,

599
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,040
we'll be regarded as admitting defeat.

600
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,950
Then we'll be utterly discredited.

601
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,710
Gao.

602
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,710
Yes.

603
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,760
Dare you fight them?

604
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,710
Fine!

605
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,640
Mom! Mom!

606
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
What are they doing?

607
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,070
Let's go! Come on!

608
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,110
It's over there! Right ahead!

609
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,520
Good! Good! Good!

610
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,950
Thank you!

611
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,630
107.

612
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,800
108.

613
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,840
109.

614
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,320
141.

615
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,430
142.

616
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,710
143.

617
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,870
144.

618
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,390
145.

619
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,870
We want to fight Fan Xian!

620
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,320
We want to fight Fan Xian!

621
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,360
We want to fight Fan Xian!

622
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,710
Beat me first,

623
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,470
and then you can make requests.

624
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,950
Who's next?

625
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,710
If you don't calm down,

626
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,710
fish won't bite.

627
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,280
It's been quite a while,

628
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,910
but Your Majesty, you haven't got a fish, either.

629
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,150
There's no fish in the lake.

630
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,150
Then what are we

631
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,800
fishing for here?

632
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,390
Our past.

633
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,430
You can have that.

634
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,470
I don't want that.

635
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,390
I've got a fish!

636
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,470
You're so clumsy!

637
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,560
You don't know how to fish!

638
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
I want one, too!

639
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,120
Give me another!

640
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,670
Have you forgotten?

641
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,950
We used to fish here

642
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,870
together.

643
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,040
Just like old times,

644
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,080
it's still the three of us.

645
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,120
It's different.

646
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,800
Except Your Majesty, we're all old.

647
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,560
What do you mean?

648
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,520
Do you mean that I'm an evil spirit that doesn't age?

649
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,630
Your Majesty, as the son of Heaven,

650
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,870
you're exceptionally good at handling
things and making decisions.

651
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,360
How can we be the same?

652
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,630
He's complaining.

653
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,840
I just don't get it.

654
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,520
Why don't you let Fan Xian

655
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,710
come back earlier?

656
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,800
Do you want Fan Xian

657
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,950
to take over the Neiku?

658
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,320
After all, it's the property of his mom.

659
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,230
Chen Pingping,

660
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,280
do you want Fan Xian

661
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,600
to take over the Investigator's Office?

662
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm old.

663
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,230
He's perfect for the post.

664
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
He's good,

665
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,670
but he's far from

666
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,600
perfect.

667
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,950
Do you know

668
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,910
what his biggest problem is?

669
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,710
His casual personality.

670
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,760
He's too emotional.

671
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,470
Neither.

672
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,280
His life is too smooth.

673
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,910
Overprotected by you, he has sailed through life

674
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,040
without ever hitting the rough waters.

675
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,840
Without facing mortal danger,

676
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,670
how can he become

677
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,600
the most powerful minister in the world?

678
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,430
Your Majesty, you leave him in Beiqi

679
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,390
so that he can improve himself

680
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,230
through conspiracies and plots of the enemy country.

681
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,910
What if something bad happens to him?

682
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Beiqi is weak after losing the war.

683
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,320
Under this circumstance,

684
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,080
he might go through hardships,

685
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,320
but he won't die.

686
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,280
Your Majesty,

687
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,120
it's your last test for him.

688
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,560
It's too risky after all.

689
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,390
Learn from Chen Pingping.

690
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,470
You have to be hard-hearted to make achievements.

691
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,040
There's really fish here.

692
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,040
Shen Zhong wants to hold me

693
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,000
with the "attrition warfare" approach.

694
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,430
Luckily, Gao can fight them

695
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,600
on your behalf.

696
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,470
By refusing to release Yan Bingyun,

697
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Shen Zhong surely wants to interrogate him

698
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,040
and get information about our intelligent
network in Shangjing Town.

699
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,840
I'm afraid Mr. Yan will have to suffer.

700
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
So we must save him

701
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,150
as soon as possible.

702
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,120
But Shangjing Town is so big.

703
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,670
How can we find out

704
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,280
where Embroidered Uniform Guards keep him?

705
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,910
We should wait for help?

706
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,870
From whom?

707
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,150
How do you like it here?

708
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,320
Cut the crap!

709
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,710
Shangjing Town is the base camp

710
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,910
of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

711
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,630
It's inconvenient for Wang Qinian and I to appear in public.

712
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Now you're the only one

713
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,430
remaining hidden.

714
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,630
We have to count on you.

715
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,320
What do you want me to do?

716
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,910
Chat with people on the street,

717
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,710
trying to find out the location

718
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,840
of Embroidered Uniform Guards Prison.

719
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,910
Prison?

720
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,520
I need to find Yan Bingyun.

721
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,150
You promised me that

722
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,280
you'll save my dad after completing your task.

723
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,430
Yes.

724
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,360
Follow him.

725
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,190
I'll watch here.

726
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,190
Prison.

727
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,230
Embroidered Uniform Guards Prison.

728
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,470
Your Excellency.

729
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,230
How's it going?

730
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,520
Fan Xian and Wang Qinian sneaked to

731
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
Tiaowang Inn south of the Town.

732
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,710
When entering the town,

733
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,120
the man slipped away from the Nanqing mission

734
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,950
is hiding in that inn, right?

735
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,520
Exactly.

736
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,430
Now Fan Xian and Wang Qinian

737
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,150
are hiding in the room,

738
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,430
while that man hidden in advance

739
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,600
sneaked out of the inn secretly.

740
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,040
He's smart to plan in advance.

741
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,710
But Shangjing Town

742
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,390
is controlled by us.

743
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,710
Follow the man who sneaked out of the Inn.

744
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,840
Yes.

745
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,120
Haven't you finished the alteration?

746
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,430
Your Excellency, please give me more days.

747
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,600
I still need to alter some parts.

748
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,280
Fine, as you wish.

749
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:08,800
Yes.

750
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,630
Your Excellency, it's not right.

751
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,280
What's wrong?

752
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,430
They're watching us outside.

753
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,950
According to years of experience

754
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,120
in tracking and sneaking,

755
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,360
I can't be wrong.

756
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,670
It's the Shangjing Town of Beiqi.

757
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,120
It's their job

758
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,320
to watch us.

759
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,560
Your Excellency,

760
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,280
Guo Baokun was followed

761
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,230
when he left just now.

762
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,230
I'm afraid Guo Baokun

763
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,080
is exposed.

764
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Of course he is.

765
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,380
In the river of history,

766
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,580
time goes round and round.

767
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,940
Memories about the former and present lives

768
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,820
join each other in an endless way.

769
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,420
In the long drunken Milky Way,

770
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,140
one season follows another in a flash,

771
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,340
and the wild geese are flying south.

772
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,260
I just can't give up

773
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,260
to be with you for my whole life.

774
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,540
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

775
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,340
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

776
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,220
Year after year in the wandering,

777
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,780
I count the remaining years.

778
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,980
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

779
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,540
even though we have ended up the destiny,

780
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,220
I never feel regretful.

781
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,180
In such a chaotic world,

782
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,940
I still miss you as ever.

783
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,580
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

784
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,300
With a gentle heart,

785
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,860
I cherish our remaining years.

786
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,700
Even though we have to go through

787
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,660
all the hardships along the journey,

788
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:19,980
you always stay by my side,

789
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,740
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

790
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,660
Year after year in the wandering,

791
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,020
I count the remaining years.

792
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,380
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

793
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,180
even though we end up the destiny,

794
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,620
I never feel regretful.

795
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,540
In such a chaotic world,

796
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,500
I still miss you as ever.

797
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,180
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

798
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,940
With a gentle heart,

799
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,340
I cherish our remaining years.

800
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,140
Even though we have to go through

801
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,300
all the hardships along the journey,

802
00:44:51,820 --> 00:45:00,580
you always stay by my side.
