1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 14

16
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,190
Someone asked me to kill you when nobody is around,

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
but I don't like it.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,270
You're so cruel as to kill people in broad daylight.
=Cheng Jushu, Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master of Beiqi=

19
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,760
What you did is unforgivable.

20
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,800
I'll kill you

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,440
in public!

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,270
Someone wants to do business with you,

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,270
but I don't.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,400
They don't kill you for overall interests.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me do it!

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,630
Delay Fan Xian.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,550
Follow me! Go!

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,270
Go!

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,720
I've made much progress

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
since my last battle with you.

31
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,080
You'll certainly die today!

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,190
Call for help! Stop Fan Xian!

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,390
If there's no one

34
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,630
you're willing to die for

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,800
in this world,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,190
how boring it will be!

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,600
I understand.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,190
Only with someone like that

39
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,190
can we really

40
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,360
take roots in this world.

41
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,670
In public?

42
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,160
Yes.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,080
Most of our men are waiting

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,630
in the forest out of town

45
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,190
on your instructions.

46
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,960
-So, we can't... -Okay.

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,750
I'll go there myself.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,600
Don't come over.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
It's horrible.

50
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,630
This is Teng Zijing's dagger.

51
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,550
You should remember the name.

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,550
Big guy.

53
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,600
I'm looking for you.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,240
You don't live in the box now?

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,800
Stop there.

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,960
Uncle Fan.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,110
Stop it.

58
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,750
What happened to your head?

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,470
Don't hurt him.

60
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,190
I can let you go.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,720
Stop it!

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,750
Turn around!

63
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,070
Do you know the big guy

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,830
who live in the box?

65
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,950
You might've had a chance

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,110
if you had hijacked him.

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,070
Since I was born,

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,390
people have been frightened or disgusted

69
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,440
when they see me.

70
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,040
They beg me to kill other people

71
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,000
or stay away from me.

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,270
He's the only one

73
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,040
who'd treat me on fruit.

74
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,880
Yeah.

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,200
He's like a kid when he eats a pear.

76
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,670
Oh. Uncle Fan,

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
do you know where my dad is?

78
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,950
Catch him!

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,070
Walk forward. Don't look back.

80
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,040
Walk straight on.

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,600
Go home.

82
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,550
Walk straight on!

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you know what you've done?

84
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,110
I just enforced justice on behalf of Heaven.

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,440
You idiot. You ruined our plan!

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,880
Hold back your anger.

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,440
How about having some bitter gourd?

88
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,200
The Investigator's Office never tolerates anyone

89
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,000
that disobey orders.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,320
I didn't. I have the same seniority as you.

91
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Not anymore!

92
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,270
What are you doing? Mr. Fei gave it to me.

93
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,640
If he is here,

94
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,670
I'll blame him

95
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,920
for hiring the wrong person.

96
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,510
Well, Your Excellency,

97
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,270
are you so powerful

98
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,040
as to blame your peers

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000
in the Investigator's Office?

100
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,550
Fan Xian,

101
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,830
you destroyed

102
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,640
your promising future today.

103
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,110
Shall I say sorry to you?

104
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,950
Will it make you feel better?

105
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,670
Take him to the dungeon.

106
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,950
How is the food there?

107
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,040
I don't like spicy food.

108
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,160
I need soup every day.

109
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,000
Was Cheng Jushu really killed?

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,230
Yes, it's true.

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,440
Fan Xian has been arrested by the Investigator's Office.

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
How did he do that?

113
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,720
He's so arrogant

114
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,720
that he didn't wait to do it out of town.

115
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,270
He fought and killed Cheng Jushu

116
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,880
just at the gate of the Investigator's Office

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
under the watchful eyes of people.

118
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,070
Numerous pedestrians

119
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,200
have witnessed it.

120
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,950
He's really a hot-blooded young man.

121
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,880
It seems impossible

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,350
to hide the news.

123
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,110
He's not just hot-blooded.

124
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,760
He's made a correct assessment of the situation.

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,390
He killed a guy in broad daylight and didn't try to hide it.

126
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,040
Can we really say he's made a correct assessment?

127
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,160
Yes.

128
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,480
He did a good job.

129
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,880
Prepare an imperial decree.

130
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,510
Your Excellency.

131
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,390
Your Excellency.

132
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,950
What's up?

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,720
Do you want to rebel?

134
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,440
How dare we do that?

135
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,950
Master Fei asked us to

136
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,160
take good care of Young Master Fan

137
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
before he left.

138
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,790
Fei Jie is not in the capital city.

139
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,040
No matter he's here or not,

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,950
the Third Division

141
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,320
will do as he said, right?

142
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,440
Young Master Fan, don't worry.

143
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,480
You're a disciple of Mr. Fei,

144
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,160
so all of us will treat you as our junior fellow apprentice.

145
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,440
Don't be afraid now that we're here.

146
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,070
Hi, everyone.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,790
Hi, junior.

148
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,600
He's really handsome and highly esteemed.

149
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,670
Enough.

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,790
Leng is the acting director

151
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,790
of the Third Division, right?

152
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Ask him to come and see me.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,670
Sorry, Your Excellency.

154
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,110
He developed

155
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,950
a new kind of poison the other day.

156
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,270
He can't move

157
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,950
after taking some of it.

158
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,640
However, he also asked us

159
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,790
to protect Young Master Fan.

160
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,200
He tried the poison himself?

161
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,150
Let me tell you.

162
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,400
It's a tradition of the Third Division.

163
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,550
Leng is

164
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,440
also one of Master Fei's disciples.

165
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,670
He can be considered as our senior fellow apprentice.

166
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,470
I have to see him.

167
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,400
Definitely.

168
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,440
However, it's a little serious this time.

169
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
It may take him 10 to 15 days to recover.

170
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,590
You have to wait.

171
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,230
He's awesome.

172
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,080
Exactly.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,150
So who can tell me

174
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,520
what are you going to do to protect him?

175
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,400
Your Excellency, he doesn't
have to be put into the dungeon

176
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,760
no matter what he did, right?

177
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,590
Okay.

178
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,230
I'm taking him

179
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,440
to the dungeon myself.

180
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,230
Anyone who tries to stop me will be considered a rebel,

181
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,030
whose family will get into trouble.

182
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,760
Don't try to scare us.

183
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,520
Step aside!

184
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,550
Get ready!

185
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,400
Hold on.

186
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,230
It's a minor matter. I'll take care of it.

187
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,110
Are you sure?

188
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,200
Trust me.

189
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,710
Now that Fan Jie is not in the capital city,

190
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,910
the Third Division could do nothing

191
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
without a leader.

192
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm much obliged to them.

193
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,200
Fan Xian,

194
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,550
you ruined our plan to attack Beiqi.

195
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,200
Nobody can save you.

196
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,760
Have you thought of it

197
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,350
when you killed Cheng Jushu?

198
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,200
Your Excellency, hold on.

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,280
Wait.

200
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,760
What?

201
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,710
Even a clerk dares to stop me?

202
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,470
Don't get me wrong.

203
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,910
How could I dare to do that?

204
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,520
I'll never stop you.

205
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,710
Step aside.

206
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,350
Hold on.

207
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,350
Believe it or not. I'll fire you!

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,670
Your Excellency,

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,440
Fan Xian did something good to Nanqing!

210
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,550
Are you crazy?

211
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,840
Your Excellency,

212
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,670
could you tell me which general of Beiqi

213
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,960
wants to exchange their military plan

214
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,280
for Cheng Jushu?

215
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,150
It's none of your business!

216
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,710
Your Excellency, please check this.

217
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,760
What's this?

218
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,640
It's a file

219
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,550
on Cheng Jushu's life.

220
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,350
What on earth do you want to say?

221
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,200
I've read it carefully.

222
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,590
Cheng Jushu is unsociable and eccentric.

223
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,790
He's obstinate and unruly.

224
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,710
He doesn't have any friend

225
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,230
who serves in the army.

226
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,790
Besides,

227
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,640
most of the high-ranking military officers

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,910
of Beiqi at the border

229
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,880
think poorly of him

230
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,710
and even hold grudges against him.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
In this case,

232
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,110
who would want

233
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,110
to exchange their military plan

234
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,790
for Cheng Jushu's life?

235
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,670
They aim to give you false information

236
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,080
in the name of saving Cheng Jushu.

237
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,400
Your Excellency Fan, you're really clever.

238
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,200
I agree with you.

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,470
They want to take this opportunity

240
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,590
to send us false information.

241
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,520
Once we go to war,

242
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,710
such disinformation

243
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,350
will make us fall into deadly traps.

244
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,710
So,

245
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,080
by killing Cheng Jushu,

246
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,670
His Excellency Fan did a good job

247
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,400
instead of making a mistake.

248
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,960
Your Excellency, did you hear that?

249
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,030
Your Excellency,

250
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,000
His Excellency Fan set things right accidentally

251
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,150
by doing that.

252
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,470
Please give him a lesser punishment.

253
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,520
Wang Qinian,

254
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,880
you've spared no effort

255
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,080
to save Fan Xian.

256
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,710
That's a strong word.

257
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm taking the matter on its merits.

258
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,280
Do you think you're the only one

259
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,200
who has noticed that?

260
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,670
It's a war of nations. We all know its importance.

261
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
How could I not find out

262
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Cheng Jushu's background?

263
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,000
So...

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
Answer me.

265
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,520
Why do you think

266
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,150
I want to exchange Cheng Jushu's life

267
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,710
for that disinformation?

268
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,350
Did you turn their trick to our own use?

269
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,640
You want to make them believe

270
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,910
we've taken the bait?

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,910
By then we'd know

272
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,320
everything about them clearly.

273
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,880
It'd be easy to defeat them.

274
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,760
But Fan Xian killed Cheng Jushu.

275
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,550
He's destroyed our plan!

276
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,200
He... He...

277
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,760
It's understandable, anyway.

278
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,470
Since when could the
Investigator's Office stand such a matter?

279
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,710
Fan Xian, have a guess.

280
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,910
Who else would try to save you?

281
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm a people person.

282
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,440
I can't guess it.

283
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,710
Head is not in the capital city.

284
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,030
Nobody can save you.

285
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,030
Take him away!

286
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,880
Wait.

287
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,520
Hold on.

288
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,030
Yan Ruohai?

289
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,740
=Yan Ruohai, director of the Fourth Division
of the Investigator's Office=

290
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,910
I've thought of many people,

291
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,760
but I didn't expect it'd be you.

292
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,790
Who is he?

293
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,440
You don't know him?

294
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,760
The Investigator's Office is divided into eight divisions.

295
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,880
This is His Excellency Yan Ruohai,
director of the Fourth Division

296
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,200
that's responsible for supervising
officials outside the capital city

297
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,440
and carrying on

298
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,670
secret investigations.

299
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
The name sounds familiar to me.

300
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,550
I'm seeing someone off.

301
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,960
The one sitting in the carriage?

302
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,030
It's Yan Ruohai's son,

303
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,280
Yan Bingyun.

304
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,590
How can you send an excellent
young man to an enemy country?

305
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,350
It's all because of you.

306
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,640
Because of me?

307
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Teng Zijing is a scout of the Fourth Division.

308
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,710
A member of the Fourth Division

309
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,790
actually tried to kill his superior.

310
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,670
Yan Ruohai

311
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,470
must take the responsibility.

312
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,030
Teng Zijing is under the command of

313
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,550
his son Yan Bingyun.

314
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,710
The Head was so angry that

315
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,030
he dismissed him from his post,

316
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,960
The Fourth Division is in charge of detection and patrol.

317
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,150
The Sixth Division is the division
responsible for assassination.

318
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,030
Whoever wants to kill you

319
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,910
didn't try hard enough.

320
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,710
The fake order wasn't given to the Sixth Division,

321
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,230
so the scout of the Fourth Division

322
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,790
took action.

323
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,280
If someone from the Sixth Division took the order,

324
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,520
then you were in real trouble.

325
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,030
I didn't know

326
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,080
there are so many stories behind.

327
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,840
My son was demoted and left
the capital city because of you.

328
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,440
Yan Bingyun is your son.

329
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,200
Let him go.

330
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,110
Bingyun lurks in the capital of Beiqi

331
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,030
and may be killed at any time.

332
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,440
It's all his fault.

333
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,350
I know.

334
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,840
Why did you help him?

335
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,350
I'm just here to pass on a message.

336
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,320
Head is not in the capital city.

337
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,880
From whom is the message?

338
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,200
It's an imperial decree.

339
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,080
Aren't you going to kneel down?

340
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,470
I'm listening with respectful attention.

341
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,640
Wang Qinian, what's going on?

342
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,350
Kneel down.

343
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,030
I can't.

344
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,350
I'm tied up.

345
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,440
Your Excellency.

346
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,110
Stop it!

347
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,710
Forget about it. I don't want to read it.

348
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,640
Look at it yourself.

349
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,030
It's simple.

350
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,440
His Majesty asked you to let Fan Xian go.

351
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
I will obey the order.

352
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,710
Guards.

353
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,280
Untie the ropes.

354
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,710
Return the token to him.

355
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,190
You're free to go.

356
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,710
Thank you, Your Excellency.

357
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,190
Even if those things hadn't happened to my son,

358
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,430
I don't like you

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
because of your casual attitude.

360
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,880
I helped to save you,

361
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,830
but I still look down upon you.

362
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,640
So, don't thank me. Go home.

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,040
Wang Qinian,

364
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
walk me home.

365
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,640
I have the same seniority as him.

366
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,920
Your Excellencies,

367
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,830
let me drive His Excellency Fan away.

368
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,400
Go!

369
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,430
Your Excellency, see you around.

370
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,230
Your Excellency.

371
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,000
Your Excellency,

372
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,430
tell me

373
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,040
how you made His Excellency Yan Ruohai

374
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,920
your friend from your enemy.

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,040
I didn't know him.

376
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,230
Do you know His Majesty?

377
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,710
What do you think?

378
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,640
Then I'm confused.

379
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,110
You killed Cheng Jushu

380
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,310
at the gate of the Investigator's Office,

381
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,800
but His Majesty ordered them to set you free.

382
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,560
Why?

383
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,710
Because I did it in public.

384
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,470
What?

385
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,590
If I killed Cheng Jushu in secret,

386
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,760
I'd be punished.

387
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,430
On the contrary,

388
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,560
I'd be safe since I did it in public.

389
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,560
Why?

390
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,680
Four words.

391
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,830
People will talk.

392
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,830
That's why His Majesty did that.

393
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,800
Everyone is talking about the assassination attempt

394
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
that was carried out yesterday.

395
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,000
Today, Fan Xian

396
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,710
killed Cheng Jushu in public.

397
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,560
Everyone knows that

398
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,920
he did it to take revenge.

399
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,640
So what?

400
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,950
Cheng Jushu is a martial arts master from Beiqi.

401
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,070
Your Excellency,

402
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,760
Nanqing

403
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,760
is the world's leading power.

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,350
People here are always proud and confident.

405
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,950
Now, a gifted scholar in Nanqing killed

406
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,760
a martial arts master from Beiqi.

407
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,400
Isn't it a story passed on with approval?

408
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,350
What will the common people think

409
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
if we put Fan Xian into prison?

410
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,230
But

411
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,040
he broke the law anyway.

412
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,280
The war will begin soon. It's important to
win support from the common people.

413
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,430
What His Majesty wants to protect

414
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,430
is not Fan Xian

415
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,800
but people's determination to win

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,280
and their fighting will.

417
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,350
I see.

418
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,880
That's why you wanted to kill Cheng Jushu

419
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
in broad daylight.

420
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,520
When I did that,

421
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,590
I just wanted to take revenge.

422
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
I didn't figure out the whole thing

423
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,310
until it all had happened.

424
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,800
It means

425
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,680
Heaven rewards the good.

426
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,520
What you did conforms to the will of Heaven,

427
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,640
so you turned ill luck into good.

428
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,400
Wang,

429
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,280
do me another favor.

430
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,920
You've already killed him.

431
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,110
I haven't found the one behind the scenes.

432
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,070
It's not over yet.

433
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,230
But Cheng Jushu is dead.

434
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,280
There were also two female assassinators.

435
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,430
They're dead too.

436
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,110
It doesn't matter.

437
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,160
Find out their background.

438
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,110
Your Excellency,

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,230
it's confidential. I don't have the right to...

440
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,190
Fine.

441
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,070
For truth and justice,

442
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,110
it's my bounden duty.

443
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,860
=Capital City=

444
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,470
Fan Xian knows clearly

445
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,400
the one behind the assassination
attempt is extremely powerful

446
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,800
now that it even dared to do it in public.

447
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,760
This is just the beginning.

448
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,470
The road ahead

449
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,710
will be full of hazards.

450
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,880
Uncle! Uncle!

451
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,000
Why are you here?

452
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,160
Uncle, how is it going

453
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,110
with that big guy?

454
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,920
Why did you

455
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,190
fight him?

456
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,000
Where did you see him?

457
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,430
In a courtyard.

458
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,400
At that time,

459
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,230
he lived in a box.

460
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,950
Do you remember

461
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,190
where it is?

462
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,310
Yeah.

463
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,470
Can you tell me about it?

464
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,190
The courtyard is beside the stable

465
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,880
on Dashu Street.

466
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,400
Uncle.

467
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,640
I'll take you to my mom.

468
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,310
Mom!

469
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,000
Uncle Fan is here.

470
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Open the door.

471
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,470
Mrs. Teng.

472
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Go to play.

473
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,830
Come in.

474
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,590
My son said

475
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,310
he saw you fight a guy on the street.

476
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,560
He's called Cheng Jushu,

477
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,230
an Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master of Beiqi.

478
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,000
He was injured and had difficulty in moving,

479
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,110
or I couldn't be a match for him.

480
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,680
I...

481
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,950
I killed him

482
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,470
without letting your son seeing it.

483
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,560
I...

484
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,430
I killed him because...

485
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,310
Yesterday afternoon,

486
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,470
Zijing and I

487
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,070
were attacked

488
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,110
on Niulan Street.

489
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,520
I...

490
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,280
I lit the lamp last night.

491
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,590
He said something to me

492
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,710
after he decided to stay in the capital city.

493
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,070
I don't want to stay overnight in the capital city.

494
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,880
I'll come back every night.

495
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,920
Remember to leave a lamp on for me.

496
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,040
The lamp will be always on

497
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,430
till you come back.

498
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,190
Crises occur here and there in the capital city.

499
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,310
I may get into trouble anytime since I stay with Mr. Fan.

500
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,560
Maybe,

501
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,590
I can't come back someday.

502
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,310
Mr. Fan, how is it going with him?

503
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,400
Zijing...

504
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,190
... was killed.

505
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,190
Mrs. Teng.

506
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,560
Don't touch me!

507
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,920
Where is his body?

508
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,430
Just outside.

509
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,590
He couldn't have died

510
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,070
if it weren't for me.

511
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,590
I owe him a life.

512
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,230
I once asked him

513
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,950
why he chose to stay despite all the danger.

514
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,070
He said

515
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,070
he knew it's dangerous to stay

516
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,640
and also thought about leaving.

517
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,640
But Mr. Fan treats me sincerely

518
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,800
like a friend.

519
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,350
I chose to stay

520
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,280
not to pay a debt of gratitude

521
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,110
or protect him as my master.

522
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,000
I've been treating you as my bosom friend

523
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,310
although I've never told you.

524
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,710
You're younger than me,

525
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,400
so you're my younger brother.

526
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,830
In this case,

527
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,280
I'd never leave you alone

528
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,040
in the capital city

529
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,110
where you may encounter

530
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,160
both open and covert attacks.

531
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,070
I stay

532
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,800
because I want to.

533
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,160
I won't regret

534
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,280
even if I have to undergo the most severe trials

535
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,110
and lose my life.

536
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,710
Fan Xian, take care of them

537
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,310
for me.

538
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,560
Mr. Fan,

539
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,040
this is why he chose to stay.

540
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,520
You owe him nothing.

541
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,000
He chose to do it himself.

542
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,280
Mrs. Teng, how about

543
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,710
moving to the capital city with your son?

544
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,710
From now on,

545
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
I'll treat your son as mine.

546
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,110
Don't bother.

547
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,040
I see.

548
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,190
You want to stay here.

549
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,160
It's okay.

550
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,800
I'll send guys to take care of you.

551
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,920
I'll also visit you regularly.

552
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,680
No, thank you.

553
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,430
In the future,

554
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,640
you'd better not come again.

555
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,710
Mr. Fan,

556
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,280
I know you're sincere,

557
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,560
but I don't want to see

558
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,000
anything happen

559
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,000
to his only son

560
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,070
someday.

561
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,160
Mr. Fan,

562
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,160
he died for you of his own will,

563
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,070
but as a woman,

564
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,800
I can't see those larger issues.

565
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,000
He left us alone, so I can't help complaining.

566
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:59,430
Please forgive me.

567
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,800
I see.

568
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,920
He promised to grow old with you,

569
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,400
but he died before he kept his promise.

570
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,040
I can understand

571
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,800
even if you hate me to the core.

572
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,640
So,

573
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,350
I'm leaving.

574
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,520
Wang Qinian.

575
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,590
Your Excellency, I'm going to see you.

576
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,310
I need you to do something for me.

577
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,710
You must be well-connected in the capital city.

578
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,160
Hire some people

579
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,520
to take care of Teng Zijing's wife and son in secret.

580
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,760
Don't let them know it's me that did it.

581
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,640
Your Excellency, you can rely on me.

582
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,950
Why do you want to see me?

583
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,350
Did you find something out?

584
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,760
I read a file in secret

585
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,470
at the First Division.

586
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,230
The two female assassinators

587
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
are disciples or followers of

588
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,560
Si Gujian in Dongyi Town.

589
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,640
One of the Great Masters wants to kill me?

590
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,160
Don't think too much.

591
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,800
The Four Great Masters

592
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,880
are extraordinary.

593
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,040
Si Gujian once defended

594
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,150
the whole town of Dongyi

595
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,320
all alone.

596
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,910
You can imagine how impressive he is.

597
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,560
If he wanted to kill you,

598
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,000
he wouldn't need to assassinate you.

599
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:18,910
So,

600
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,360
it's someone else

601
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,080
behind the two assassinators.

602
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,230
Who is it?

603
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,710
It's hard to tell.

604
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,430
They're dead

605
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,560
and we don't know where they stayed.

606
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,800
We don't have any clue.

607
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,800
I know where they lived.

608
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,120
How did you know that?

609
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,390
Where did you see him?

610
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,040
In a courtyard.

611
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,760
At that time,

612
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,520
he lived in a box.

613
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,470
Do you remember

614
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,800
where it is?

615
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,280
They had a fight.

616
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,150
The pattern looks familiar.

617
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,360
Where did you see it?

618
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,230
Let me think about it.

619
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,840
Oh.

620
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
One of our secret agents

621
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,560
that lurk in Beiqi

622
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,600
sent us a secret report,

623
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,150
on which

624
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,470
I saw the pattern.

625
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,040
What does it mean?

626
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,040
I didn't look at it carefully.

627
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,280
Where is

628
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,320
the secret report?

629
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,150
I think it's in His Excellency Zhu's room.

630
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,190
Zhu Ge.

631
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,120
Right.

632
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,040
But I don't think he'll show it to you.

633
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,150
I'll steal it.

634
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,910
Let me do it.

635
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,840
I'm more familiar

636
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,950
with the situation there.

637
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,520
Do you know what will happen

638
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,470
if you're caught?

639
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,430
Your Excellency,

640
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,150
I've already broken the rules

641
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,910
by selling books and drawings.

642
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,520
I also stole the information

643
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,760
about the two assassinators.

644
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm an old hand

645
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,520
at such things.

646
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,280
I'll go with you.

647
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,120
Your Excellency, I accept your kindness.

648
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,630
Actually,

649
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,760
the Investigator's Office is investigating

650
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,670
the assassination attempt.

651
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,190
What else do you want to tell me?

652
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,710
When I looked for information

653
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,390
about the two female assassinators,

654
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,040
I found another clue in the file.

655
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,190
The crossbows used by them

656
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
belong to military supplies.

657
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

658
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,430
Um. I think

659
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,600
it's a serious matter that secret agents of Beiqi

660
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,670
collude with the military.

661
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,430
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble

662
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,230
if you're involved.

663
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,910
But why did you tell me in the end?

664
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,040
You said

665
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,320
you want to steal that secret report

666
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,190
from His Excellency Zhu.

667
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,600
In this case, I have nothing to worry about.

668
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,950
Now that they belong to military supplies,

669
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,230
do you know where they're from?

670
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,080
It's not mentioned in the file.

671
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,230
The First Division

672
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,470
must be investigating.

673
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,470
So, they haven't got any clue.

674
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,080
Actually,

675
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,760
I know something about it.

676
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,120
Go ahead.

677
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,840
The Patrol Division

678
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,870
lost a batch of bows and crossbows

679
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,950
the other day.

680
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,560
I think what the assassinators used

681
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,390
must be part of them.

682
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,600
How did you know that?

683
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,600
The Investigator's Office is also
responsible for army inspections.

684
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,040
The commander

685
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,910
came to me that day

686
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,630
and asked me to help him hide the truth.

687
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,840
I did him a favor.

688
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,000
So, you didn't report it.

689
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,150
You charged him, right?

690
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,280
Of course.

691
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,190
To support family.

692
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,360
You often did such things, right?

693
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Or he couldn't have come to you.

694
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,840
I'm warm-hearted

695
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,430
and righteous.

696
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,120
It's true

697
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,280
I've earned a good reputation.

698
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,150
Stop bragging.

699
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,080
Do you mean

700
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,670
something has gone wrong with the commander?

701
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,040
Your Excellency, how about this?

702
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,710
I'll go back to the Investigator's Office

703
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,190
to steal the report

704
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,150
and see if I can find out its origin.

705
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,760
You go to the commander's mansion

706
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,630
to look for clues.

707
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,870
Give me the address.

708
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,600
That's it.

709
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,470
Your Excellency.

710
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,710
How will you explain it?

711
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,950
Your Excellency.

712
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,430
You've been working hard and
performing a valuable service.

713
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,910
I admire you very much.

714
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,800
I don't know what I should do

715
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,000
to show my respect,

716
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,710
so I went to clean your room.

717
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,600
I mean that

718
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,910
from the bottom of my heart.

719
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,600
So,

720
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,000
it's also you

721
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,840
that looked up the information

722
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
on the assassination attempt on Niulan Street.

723
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,150
Your Excellency, you already knew that.

724
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,230
Catch him!

725
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,800
I must go!

726
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,080
He's really a master of lightness skill.

727
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,600
Dismiss Wang Qinian's rank.

728
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,950
Hunt for him in the whole city.

729
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,630
Yes, sir.

730
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,950
I was found by His Excellency Zhu.

731
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,760
The First Division is hunting for me.

732
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,600
Alright. Don't panic.

733
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,670
I've got a Director-General token.

734
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,520
Nobody can take you away from me.

735
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,710
What's going on here?

736
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,120
Everyone here

737
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,230
hanged themselves from a beam.

738
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,630
Everyone?

739
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,950
They all died.

740
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,870
Something must be going wrong.

741
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,630
If the commander committed suicide
because he colluded with the enemy,

742
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,000
how about his servants?

743
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,230
Why did they also do that?

744
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,760
He just received visitors in the study,

745
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,150
but they're gone.

746
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,320
It's all my fault.

747
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,190
If I had told you earlier

748
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,520
about this matter,

749
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,630
maybe they could've been saved.

750
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,360
The same thing would happen even if you had.

751
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,870
They want me to be here a little late.

752
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,600
Just a little late.

753
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,840
This is a warning. This is a threat.

754
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,740
In the river of history,

755
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,940
time goes round and round.

756
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,300
Memories about the former and present lives

757
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,180
join each other in an endless way.

758
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,780
In the long drunken Milky Way,

759
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,500
one season follows another in a flash,

760
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,700
and the wild geese are flying south.

761
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,620
I just can't give up

762
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,620
to be with you for my whole life.

763
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,900
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

764
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,700
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

765
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,580
Year after year in the wandering,

766
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,140
I count the remaining years.

767
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,340
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

768
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,900
even though we have ended up the destiny,

769
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,580
I never feel regretful.

770
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,540
In such a chaotic world,

771
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,300
I still miss you as ever.

772
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,940
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

773
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,660
With a gentle heart,

774
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,220
I cherish our remaining years.

775
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,060
Even though we have to go through

776
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,020
all the hardships along the journey,

777
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:34,340
you always stay by my side,

778
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,100
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

779
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,020
Year after year in the wandering,

780
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,380
I count the remaining years.

781
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,740
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

782
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,540
even though we end up the destiny,

783
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,980
I never feel regretful.

784
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,900
In such a chaotic world,

785
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,860
I still miss you as ever.

786
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,540
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

787
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,300
With a gentle heart,

788
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,700
I cherish our remaining years.

789
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,500
Even though we have to go through

790
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,660
all the hardships along the journey,

791
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:14,940
you always stay by my side...
