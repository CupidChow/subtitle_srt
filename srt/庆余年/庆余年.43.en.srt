1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 43

16
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680
Now I see.

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,760
As a consort,

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,950
she shouldn't die in obscurity.

19
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,310
The truth is hidden by someone.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,120
Since it's a top secret,

21
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,360
petty officials like us are not supposed to know it.

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,830
You're right.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,360
So I've got

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,550
a goal for my life.

25
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,910
I know what I want to do.

26
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,880
I want to be the Head of the Investigator's Office

27
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,190
and become the most powerful minister in Nanqing.

28
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,000
Only in this way

29
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,110
can I be qualified enough to find out the truth.

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,600
To find out the truth,

31
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,270
I need assistants and friends.

32
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,160
Your Excellency, I'm here.

33
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,910
You alone won't be enough.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,830
Yan Bingyun?

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,550
Your Excellency, you want to take him under your wing.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,080
But it won't be easy

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
to win him over.

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,470
Besides that,

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,910
we have to make Shen Zhong

40
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,550
tell us about the smuggler.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
It's even harder.

42
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,240
I want to have a try.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,550
Well,

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,470
I don't have many to trust.

45
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,670
Don't tell anyone about

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,080
our words today.

47
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,440
Your Excellency, do feel relieved.

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,160
Your Excellency.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,630
I'm not much of a speaker,

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,190
but if you really want to climb up,

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,520
I can be your ladder.

52
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,670
Wang Qinian,

53
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,830
what do you live for?

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,520
For my wife and daughter

55
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,110
of course.

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,800
Well said.

57
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,800
You're not a ladder, but a partner.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
My Lady, His Excellency Shen is in front.

59
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,440
Brother!

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,320
You went to see him again!

61
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,520
You shouldn't have!

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,790
Our parents passed away early.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,230
They left you in my care,

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,230
so that I can take good care of you

65
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,880
and protect you.

66
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,790
I don't want to stop you

67
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,480
from seeking the man you love,

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
but Yan Bingyun

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
can only hurt you.

70
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,950
Brother,

71
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,920
that would be my last time to see him.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,230
I have broken off with him.

73
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,390
Did he say anything to break your heart?

74
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,950
I'll find him.

75
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,070
Don't!

76
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,950
You still can't forget him!

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,390
Brother,

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,440
just give me a few more days.

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
I will forget him

80
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,350
bit by bit.

81
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Go home first.

82
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,510
What are you going to do?

83
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,110
Don't worry. I have something to say.

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,070
I won't go for Yan Bingyun.

85
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,440
Really?

86
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,200
Brother!

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,160
Do feel relieved.

88
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,600
I won't see him anymore.

89
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,550
Fan Xian! Fan Xian!

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,950
Your Excellency Shen, you're here.

91
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,760
What's up?

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,110
Your Excellency Shen,

93
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,390
what about talking inside?

94
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
Don't target at my younger sister.

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,510
Your Excellency Shen, you're kidding me.

96
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,640
Your younger sister is actually

97
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
targeting at Mr. Yan.

98
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,270
From today on,

99
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,550
I'll lock her up in her room

100
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,070
till you leave Shangjing.

101
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,550
You can lock her up, but you can't lock up her heart.

102
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,270
Do remember my words.

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,720
If Yan Bingyun dares seduce her again,

104
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,790
I'll kill him myself

105
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,880
even if I have to lose my rank.

106
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,350
How about this?

107
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,350
Your Excellency Shen, I ask you a question.

108
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,600
If you tell me the answer,

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,830
I'll help you kill Yan Bingyun.

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,790
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

111
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,830
Your Excellency Shen, take it easy.

112
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,950
I'm not joking.

113
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,040
I've checked the account book of

114
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,950
our Neiku branch in Shangjing Town.

115
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,760
For so many years,

116
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,230
someone from Nanqing has been

117
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,230
pocketing vast sums of money.

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,600
Your Excellency Shen, do you know that?

119
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,670
What if I know?

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,390
Good.

121
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,640
Tell me the name and give me the evidence,

122
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,950
I guarantee

123
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,160
your younger sister and Yan Bingyun

124
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,200
won't see each other again.

125
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,070
Aren't you born wise?

126
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,070
If you want to know the name of the smuggler,

127
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,950
why not make a guess?

128
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,110
Your Excellency Shen, so you don't want to tell me.

129
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
What can you do

130
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,760
if I don't tell you?

131
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,070
Then I have to do something.

132
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,950
I'll wait and see.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,670
I'm afraid by then,

134
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,920
there's no way back for everyone.

135
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,040
That's most welcome.

136
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,550
Your Excellency Fan, I'll leave first.

137
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,790
I'll wait for your moves.

138
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,790
I will try my best

139
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,920
not to disappoint you.

140
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,040
Cunning as he is,

141
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,390
he won't tell you the name.

142
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,830
Everyone will change when coming to a dead end.

143
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,550
Trusted by Empress Dowager of Beiqi

144
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,640
and controlling the Embroidered Uniform Guards,

145
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,510
how could he

146
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,200
ever come to a dead end?

147
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,600
Rest and heal.

148
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,440
Where are you going?

149
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,790
To see Shangshan Hu.

150
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,670
How dare you see him?

151
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,230
He will kill you.

152
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,160
Maybe I should buy him some gifts.

153
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,790
Find some reliable guards

154
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,760
to guard my mansion.

155
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,910
Don't let her

156
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,590
get out these days.

157
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,550
I see.

158
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,760
Your Excellency, we've got information

159
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,080
from our man watching the mission.

160
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,080
Fan Xian went out right after you left.

161
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Where did he go?

162
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,590
Go shopping.

163
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,230
Shopping for what?

164
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,320
This one is really exquisite.

165
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,030
Sir, you're right.

166
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,080
The color looks joyful.

167
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,150
Boss,

168
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,670
do you sell coffins?

169
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,440
Yes, coffins are in the backyard.

170
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
Sir, you can go and pick.

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,880
No hurry.

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,590
I'll have a look at these.

173
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,760
Excuse me,

174
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,670
did any of your relatives or friends pass away?

175
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,470
No.

176
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
Then why do you buy coffins?

177
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,280
As gifts.

178
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,150
If I buy many coffins,

179
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,520
will you deliver them for me?

180
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,150
Grand General, something weird happens.

181
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,280
A man sends many coffins

182
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,790
and funeral stuff here

183
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
and piles them outside.

184
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,790
He says he is here to send gifts.

185
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,520
The gatekeeper finds him crazy

186
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,520
and wants to kick him away,

187
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,790
but he insists on seeing you.

188
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,110
Does he say his name?

189
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,150
He says he's called Fan Xian.

190
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,840
Fan Xian?

191
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,470
Fan Xian has sent coffins

192
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,320
to the door of Shangshan Hu's residence?

193
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,550
Yes.

194
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
He got Shangshan Hu's guards killed,

195
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,000
and now he's acting provocatively.

196
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,230
Where's Fan Xian? Has he left?

197
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,550
No, he wants to see Shangshan Hu.

198
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,910
He's seeking death.

199
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,590
Grand General, on hearing that

200
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,440
your guards were all killed,

201
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,550
I feel so sorry.

202
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,710
I bought coffins

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
to see them off.

204
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,400
I hope that you can take care of yourself

205
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,590
and restrain your grief.

206
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Leave us.

207
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,110
It's good you're here.

208
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,280
I guess so.

209
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,840
Save the coffins.

210
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,840
Your head would make

211
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,590
a perfect gift to see Tan Wu and others off.

212
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,670
Grand General,

213
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,400
Shen Zhong is the one who got them killed.

214
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,350
No hurry. I'll take you down one by one.

215
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm not here to fight.

216
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,710
Just let me kill you.

217
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,230
Wait! I have something to say.

218
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,350
Tell me in my dreams after you die.

219
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,880
Don't you want to know

220
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,910
where Xiao En is?

221
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,910
You prepared Xiao En's

222
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,790
substitute in advance.

223
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,910
you asked him to change clothes

224
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,760
and hide among the dead.

225
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,470
I discovered that by chance

226
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,760
and followed him all along.

227
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Don't you want to know

228
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,470
what happened later?

229
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,910
Where is my adoptive father?

230
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,350
He's dead.

231
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,350
Shen Zhong killed him.

232
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,470
What?

233
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,000
Shen Zhong was prepared in advance.

234
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,280
He ordered He Daoren and Langtao

235
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,200
to stop and kill Xiao En secretly.

236
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,590
Langtao broke off Master Xiao's

237
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,470
heart arteries and veins.

238
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,230
It was Shen Zhong who planned

239
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,000
the whole thing!

240
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,790
I'll have Langtao

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,230
and He Daoren guarding in the dark.

242
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,110
If someone really tries to

243
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,230
replace Xiao En secretly,

244
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,230
only with two Ninth Dan masters joining hands

245
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,880
can we really eliminate a hidden danger.

246
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,280
I accompanied Master Xiao

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
when he was dying.

248
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,760
He left some words for you.

249
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,640
Tell me.

250
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,440
Master Xiao asked me to tell you.

251
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,280
After I die, let me sit here.

252
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,440
Don't bury me.

253
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,150
I don't want to be buried under the ground ever again.

254
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,670
No need to avenge my death.

255
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,550
Don't provoke Chen Pingping.

256
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,520
Bury everything deep in your heart,

257
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,030
and live a happy life.

258
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,150
Don't avenge his death!

259
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,880
Don't provoke Shen Zhong!

260
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,670
Bury everything

261
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,550
deep in your heart,

262
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,440
and live a happy life.

263
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,030
Father!

264
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,150
By killing my father, he's become my mortal enemy.

265
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,550
How can I let go of him easily?

266
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,910
But how can you do that?

267
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,440
Grand General,

268
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,230
I've thought it for you.

269
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,110
Shen Zhong is a high-rank official with enormous power,

270
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,400
while you're trapped

271
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,150
in Shangjing

272
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,350
with no guards around.

273
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
You stand no chance

274
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,550
to kill him.

275
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,230
I can fight his guards and kill him on the street.

276
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,110
Then Grand General,

277
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,230
you'll be sentenced to death for sure.

278
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,080
I'm not afraid to die.

279
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,110
Master Xiao's last wish

280
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,670
is for you to live a happy life.

281
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,320
You might not be afraid to die,

282
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,790
but who will mourn Master Xiao

283
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,640
if you die?

284
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,110
Now in the entire Shangjing Town,

285
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,670
I'm the only one who can help you

286
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,640
kill Shen Zhong.

287
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,110
Shangshan Hu didn't kill Fan Xian

288
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,400
but left his residence with Fan Xian instead.

289
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,960
It's true! Indeed!

290
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,000
Where did they go?

291
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,670
According to the direction,

292
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,080
it must be the imperial palace.

293
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,030
The imperial palace?

294
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,400
I thought you come to visit His Majesty.

295
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,910
How come you're here?

296
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,790
Your Majesty,

297
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,080
after visiting you last time,

298
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,030
I find you graceful and poised,

299
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,350
kind and respected.

300
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,710
Having lost my mom when I was little,

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,760
I can't help admiring you.

302
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,080
I keep thinking about

303
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
visiting you again.

304
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,080
Today, I finally fulfilled my wish.

305
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,790
I'm sorry!

306
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,960
Just be careful.

307
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

308
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,350
Is that all?

309
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,910
Your Majesty,

310
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,520
I've been racking my brains

311
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,710
these days,

312
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,520
trying to figure out

313
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,710
what gift I shall prepare

314
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,110
for your birthday.

315
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,840
It's just for fun.

316
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,320
No need to bring me a gift.

317
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,960
I won't forgive myself

318
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
if I bring no gift.

319
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,790
Neither will I forgive myself

320
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,320
if my gift is similar to other's.

321
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,110
I have to find a gift

322
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,880
unmatched in the world.

323
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,790
So you've found it?

324
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,710
Yes.

325
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,760
Your Majesty, I feel so happy

326
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
to find the gift.

327
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,400
I can hardly wait till your birthday,

328
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,590
so I bring the gift to you today.

329
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Such being the case,

330
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,000
just show me.

331
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,710
Yes.

332
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,280
Grand General! Grand General!

333
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,030
Her Majesty asks you to come in.

334
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,440
I can help you.

335
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,150
But Grand General,

336
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,590
to avenge your father's death,

337
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,910
you have to put aside your dignity.

338
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,160
You have no choice other than that.

339
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,950
Minister Shangshan Hu pays respect to Your Majesty.

340
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,920
What's this about?

341
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,190
Your Majesty,

342
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
he is the gift

343
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,470
I prepare for your birthday.

344
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,520
What?

345
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,230
Fan Xian gave Shangshan Hu to Her Majesty

346
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,640
as her birthday gift?

347
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,000
Your Excellency,

348
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,560
I also thought I heard it wrong.

349
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,560
But after confirming many times, it's really the case.

350
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Then what?

351
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,310
Then Fan Xian said he wanted to

352
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,640
speak with Her Majesty alone.

353
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,760
So Her Majesty

354
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,680
asked everyone else to leave.

355
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,590
Our agent

356
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,590
dared not to stay of course.

357
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,880
So we don't know

358
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,950
what they would say later.

359
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,640
Reporting to Her Majesty alone,

360
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,070
but he's the minister of the enemy country!

361
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,230
The Saintess is also inside the Hall.

362
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,590
There should be no danger.

363
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,350
It's such a weird move.

364
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,350
Giving Shangshan Hu away as the birthday gift,

365
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,400
what kind of a trick is that?

366
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,190
Your Excellency Shen, so you don't want to tell me.

367
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,640
What can you do

368
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,590
if I don't tell you?

369
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,000
Then I have to do something.

370
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,590
I'll wait and see.

371
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,110
I'll wait for your moves.

372
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,310
No,

373
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,710
I have to stop him!

374
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,280
Get the horse ready. I'm going to the imperial palace.

375
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,040
Yes.

376
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,280
As the Grand General,

377
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,070
you don't have to kowtow when meeting me.

378
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,680
Rise.

379
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,660
What's going on?
=Empress Dowager of Beiqi=

380
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:57,920
What's going on?

381
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,800
I didn't lie to Your Majesty.

382
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,430
The Grand General

383
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,640
is my gift for you.

384
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,070
Nonsense!

385
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,400
It took me some time

386
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,710
to persuade the Grand General

387
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,230
to follow Your Majesty.

388
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,190
I pledge allegiance to Your Majesty today.

389
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,560
From now on,

390
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
I will be at your disposal.

391
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,800
Grand General, you're

392
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,000
an important general of our country.

393
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,400
Why do you pledge allegiance again?

394
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,470
Before now,

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,310
he was not so loyal

396
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,880
to Your Majesty and His Majesty.

397
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,710
With a wise emperor and virtuous ministers,

398
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,160
Beiqi is prosperous.

399
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,800
How can the Grand General not be loyal to His Majesty?

400
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,040
Your Majesty,

401
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,800
there're only a few people in the Hall.

402
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's be honest.

403
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,280
How honest?

404
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,470
If His Majesty really trusts the Grand General,

405
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,190
why would His Majesty

406
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,710
transfer him away from the border troops
and trap him in Shangjing?

407
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,110
Moreover, Your Majesty,

408
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,520
you work your heart out for Beiqi,

409
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
but His Majesty

410
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,470
is not convinced.

411
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,950
You do everything for the benefits of Beiqi,

412
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,560
but His Majesty is actually suspicious of you.

413
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,950
By seeing that,

414
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,640
I also feel emotional.

415
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,640
How dare you!

416
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,350
You try to pit me against His Majesty with your silver tongue.

417
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,760
Do you really think I dare not to kill you?

418
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,590
Your Majesty, no hurry.

419
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,070
If you want to kill me, just wait till I finish my words.

420
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,190
After analyzing the current situation

421
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
with the Grand General openly,

422
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,590
he finally realized his errors

423
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,590
and decided to return to the correct path.

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,800
Your Majesty, it seems that

425
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,640
the border troops are under your control.

426
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,590
You persuaded the Grand General to serve me?

427
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,560
Exactly.

428
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,230
And Shangshan Hu just listened to you?

429
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,830
He didn't listen to me.

430
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,190
He was pushed by the general trend.

431
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,230
Which trend?

432
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,430
Your Majesty,

433
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,400
tricked by Shen Zhong,

434
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,070
Shangshan Hu lost

435
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,760
all his guards.

436
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,950
After that,

437
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,470
he was alone and helpless in Shangjing Town.

438
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,070
If he doesn't find a patron now,

439
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,110
should he really wait to die?

440
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,800
I remember a story

441
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,110
told by the late emperor.

442
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,230
I'd be glad to hear it.

443
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,070
Defeated and driven into a corner,

444
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,590
a Grand General pledged allegiance to his opponent.

445
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,190
What then?

446
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,040
Then?

447
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,640
Then he took the opportunity

448
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
to escape, staged a comeback

449
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,640
and rebuilt his army.

450
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,190
Fan Xian.

451
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,920
Yes.

452
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,110
It's easy to bend a man's knees,

453
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,280
but it's hard to predict his mind.

454
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,710
The story is good.

455
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,590
Grand General, what do you think?

456
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,070
What's this?

457
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,430
The names of

458
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,950
all my trusted subordinates

459
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,190
in the army are on it.

460
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,950
From generals who lead the army

461
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,520
to military officers of different battalions,

462
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,430
no one is left.

463
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,880
As one man, it's impossible

464
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,680
to control the entire army on my own.

465
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,350
These generals and military officers

466
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,640
form the foundation for me

467
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,470
to command the army as I wish.

468
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,430
You actually hand over the foundation you've laid

469
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,160
for commanding the army over the years?

470
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,710
Otherwise, how can I show my allegiance to Your Majesty?

471
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,000
Your Majesty, congratulations!

472
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,310
Now with the loyalty of a brave general,

473
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,400
the turbulent situations can be settled. It's so...

474
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,590
So what?

475
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,230
So good!

476
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,350
It's not right.

477
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,000
How is Beiqi turbulent?

478
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,710
Your Majesty, whatever you say.

479
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,230
Shangshan Hu.

480
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,190
Yes.

481
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,280
I've seen your sincerity.

482
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Since you want to take my side, do you want anything in return?

483
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,310
Shen Zhong killed my adoptive father with schemes.

484
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,950
Your Majesty, please avenge his death for me.

485
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,920
Xiao En?

486
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,800
Wasn't he taken away

487
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,000
and burnt to death?

488
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,880
How could Shen Zhong kill him?

489
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,920
I'm so sorry.

490
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,310
My adoptive father was saved

491
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,350
by my guards.

492
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,830
Aren't you afraid I might punish you?

493
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,230
I'm willing to take punishments.

494
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,350
Go ahead.

495
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,950
I planned to replace my adoptive father

496
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,070
and help him escape,

497
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,310
but Shen Zhong was prepared in advance.

498
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,350
He asked He Daoren

499
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,350
and Langtao to join hands

500
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,590
in killing my adoptive father.

501
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,160
Your Majesty,

502
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,470
Shen Zhong and I are absolutely irreconcilable.

503
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,590
That's not what Shen Zhong said.

504
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,520
We'll know the truth

505
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,430
by asking He Daoren

506
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,920
and Langtao.

507
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,800
Mr. He.

508
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,160
Mr. He, where are you going?

509
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,470
Her Majesty wants to see me.

510
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,230
Good, I also want to see Her Majesty.

511
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,110
Let's go together.

512
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,560
Your Excellency Shen, please.

513
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,400
Please.

514
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,800
Your Majesty, He Daoren is here.

515
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,400
Commander Shen is...

516
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,470
Your Majesty.

517
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,430
Rise.

518
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,430
Your Majesty, you're really wise and farsighted.

519
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,070
By inviting His Excellency Shen to confront face-to-face,

520
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,190
no loyal minister will be wronged.

521
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,430
Your Excellency Fan, what trick

522
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,800
are you playing now?

523
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,880
Your Excellency Shen, don't you know?

524
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,830
As you really summoned by Her Majesty?

525
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,680
Sorry! Sorry!

526
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,430
I saw His Excellency Shen come straight

527
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,760
to the Hall without reporting.

528
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,710
So I guessed wrong. Sorry.

529
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,950
Your Majesty,

530
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
Fan Xian is cunning.

531
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm too worried about you

532
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,230
to wait for reporting.

533
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,800
Please forgive me.

534
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,040
You're the most trustworthy minister of Beiqi

535
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,000
with ardent loyalty.

536
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,880
Why should I blame you?

537
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,470
It's not so easy

538
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,310
to pit me against you.

539
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,880
Your Majesty, I'm wronged. I didn't do that.

540
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Mr. He.

541
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,950
I'm so flattered.

542
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,760
Your Majesty, please call me by my name.

543
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,160
According to Shangshan Hu,

544
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,430
you and Langtao

545
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,430
were ordered by His Excellency Shen

546
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,680
to kill Xiao En?

547
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,920
Well...

548
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,400
Is it true?

549
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,070
No matter what the truth is,

550
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,760
I won't blame

551
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Commander Shen.

552
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,230
Feel relieved to tell the truth.

553
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,160
Her Majesty is asking you. Why are you hesitating?

554
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,000
I did receive order

555
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,950
from His Excellency Shen to kill Xiao En.

556
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,760
Commander Shen,

557
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,110
I remember telling you

558
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,470
to spare Xiao En's life.

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,110
I acknowledge my sin.

560
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,040
Now thinking back,

561
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,830
I didn't think it through.

562
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,880
Commander Shen, by imprisoning Xiao En,

563
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,400
you became his enemy.

564
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,590
Of course you would worry that

565
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,950
you might be in danger if Xiao En was alive.

566
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,310
You killed him to protect yourself.

567
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,040
Your Majesty, I'm willing to take punishments.

568
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,400
I know you're loyal.

569
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,110
Rise.

570
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,920
Well,

571
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,000
do I have to issue an imperial edict

572
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,070
to make you stand up?

573
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,400
Grand General.

574
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,800
Yes.

575
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,950
I know you love Xiao En

576
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,190
deeply as a son,

577
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,590
and I know you have a grudge

578
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,000
against Shen Zhong.

579
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,760
But now Beiqi faces domestic strife

580
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,350
and foreign aggression.

581
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,710
For the sake of our country,

582
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,160
I hope you can

583
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,190
let go of resentment

584
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,880
and make concerted efforts to defend Shangjing and our country.

585
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,950
I'm willing to defend my country.

586
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,590
Good.

587
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,680
Rise.

588
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,350
Commander Shen.

589
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,280
Yes.

590
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,710
The Grand General has let go of resentment

591
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,950
and offered service to the imperial court.

592
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,280
It's a blessing to Beiqi,

593
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,560
and a blessing from our ancestors.

594
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm really happy.

595
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,160
Fan Xian, as to you,

596
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,280
you've rendered great service by persuading the Grand General.

597
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,590
You've really given thoughts

598
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,710
to my gift.

599
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,470
I owe you for that.

600
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,110
I'm so flattered.

601
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,190
Your Excellency Shen,

602
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,000
I am the one who persuaded the Grand General.

603
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,280
From today on,

604
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,680
you two are colleagues.

605
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,590
Try to be good buddies.

606
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,680
Your Majesty,

607
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
I have another birthday gift for you.

608
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,760
What's that?

609
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,640
It's Neiku's branch in Shangjing Town,

610
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,070
which belongs to the imperial family of Nanqing.

611
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,800
I know that.

612
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,950
Please let me explain.

613
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,710
When I return to Nanqing,

614
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,280
I'll take over

615
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,590
the financial power of Neiku.

616
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,230
Marrying the princess and taking over the financial power,

617
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,040
I've heard of that long ago.

618
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,310
Nothing in the world

619
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,430
can escape Your Majesty's eyes.

620
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,110
How is it relevant to my birthday gift?

621
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,160
When Li Yunrui was in charge of Neiku,

622
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,230
she smuggled goods with Beiqi secretly to gain profits.

623
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,920
Now,

624
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,110
since I'm going to take over Neiku,

625
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,000
it's a pity to hand in

626
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,310
such a large sum of money.

627
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,040
In my opinion,

628
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,070
we can keep doing

629
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,430
the business.

630
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,310
I'll take over the business.

631
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,920
Your Majesty, I beg your approval.

632
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,430
As to the profit,

633
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,430
I'll give 30% to the imperial family of Beiqi.

634
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Take it

635
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,400
as my gift

636
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
for your birthday.

637
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,160
What profit from smuggling?

638
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,830
Well, Your Majesty,

639
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,110
don't you know?

640
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,110
Our Nanqing Neiku's branch

641
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,000
has been cooperating with His Excellency Shen to gain profits.

642
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,760
It's a lot of money.

643
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,560
Your Excellency Shen,

644
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,830
haven't you told Her Majesty yet?

645
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,280
Commander Shen.

646
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,800
Your Majesty,

647
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,280
the accounts of Neiku's branch

648
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,800
were falsified,

649
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,920
but the money

650
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,830
had flowed into Nanqing.

651
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,830
The Embroidered Uniform Guards didn't gain profits from that.

652
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,350
Really?

653
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,470
I can assure that with my life.

654
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,280
Your Majesty, please investigate the secret files of
the Embroidered Uniform Guards thoroughly.

655
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,590
I've never made profits from it.

656
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,950
No need to investigate.

657
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,040
Of course I trust you.

658
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,160
It turns out Your Excellency Shen is so warm-hearted

659
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
as to help others make money.

660
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,520
Doing good deeds and accumulating virtues this way,

661
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,800
you're really admirable.

662
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,000
Your Majesty,

663
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,190
the smuggling is related to

664
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,350
high-rank officials of Nanqing.

665
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,470
I thought by conniving at it,

666
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,430
we've sowed the seeds of

667
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,230
Nanqing's turbulence in future.

668
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,470
So I offered my help

669
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,040
to make it happen.

670
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,560
I see.

671
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,710
It's just a small accident. It's fine.

672
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,800
When I take over Neiku,

673
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,040
we can keep doing the business.

674
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,800
Your Majesty,

675
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,230
you can still gain profits from it.

676
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,470
As a Nanqing minister,

677
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,280
why smuggle goods with Beiqi?

678
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,230
It's such a large sum of money.

679
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,350
Even if I hand it in,

680
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,760
it'll do me no good.

681
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,110
Why not gain profits together?

682
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,280
I'm a bit greedy. Sorry.

683
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,920
Pay more attention to that.

684
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,470
Arrange it properly

685
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,190
before you leave.

686
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,880
I need another favor.

687
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,000
Go ahead.

688
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,710
Please ask His Excellency Shen to tell me

689
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,000
the name of the smuggler

690
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,350
in the imperial court of Nanqing.

691
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
No way!

692
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,710
Your Excellency Shen,

693
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,310
by taking over Neiku after returning to Nanqing,

694
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,880
I pretty much cut off his source of income.

695
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,350
He certainly hates me to the core.

696
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,880
Your Excellency Shen, tell me his name

697
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,400
so I can protect myself.

698
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,040
Then our business can last long.

699
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,560
Your Majesty,

700
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,040
the smuggler is of great importance.

701
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,070
If he rises in rebellion someday,
Nanqing will be a mess for sure.

702
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,160
By then,

703
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,640
It'll be a good opportunity for us.

704
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,880
We can't give him away now!

705
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,950
Don't worry.

706
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,470
I'm not a silly old fool.

707
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,680
Shen Zhong has made it clear.

708
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,400
The smuggler

709
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,880
in the imperial court of Nanqing

710
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,310
has nothing to do with Beiqi.

711
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,590
No need to ask him anymore.

712
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,280
I see.

713
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,830
Now that everything has settled,

714
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,110
I'll leave first.

715
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,920
Your Excellency Fan.

716
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,560
I'm confused about one thing.

717
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
May I ask you?

718
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,800
Your Excellency Shen, please go ahead.

719
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,630
Your Excellency Fan,
you're so outstanding in literary accomplishments

720
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,600
that you're respected as poetic genius from heaven in Nanqing.

721
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,760
I'm so flattered.

722
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,710
Nanqing boasts strong military forces
but is poor in literary achievements.

723
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,840
Talented as you are,

724
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,150
you're bound to have

725
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,910
a great future in Nanqing.

726
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,600
Thank you for your blessings.

727
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,950
In that sense,

728
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,080
you'll become a nobleman or a minister in the near future.

729
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,040
So I just don't get it.

730
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,120
By smuggling goods from the Neiku of Nanqing,

731
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,600
you can obtain a lot of money.

732
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,080
But money can't buy you

733
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,390
a bright future like that.

734
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
By doing so,

735
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,080
you're handing your life

736
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
over to Beiqi.

737
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,000
Your Excellency Fan,

738
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,470
are you really so shortsighted

739
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,670
as to value money over life?

740
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,040
Your Majesty,

741
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,430
this is what confuses me.

742
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,040
Fan Xian.

743
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,630
Yes.

744
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,430
Are you going to forsake darkness for light

745
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,320
and join us in Beiqi?

746
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,280
Your Majesty, that's not my plan.

747
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
Then what you do

748
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,950
makes no sense.

749
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,600
Actually,

750
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,230
I do have a reason that

751
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,560
I've never told others.

752
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,360
Tell us about it.

753
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Your Majesty, by persuading

754
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,600
the Grand General to serve you

755
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,430
and offering you profits gained from

756
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,320
future smuggling,

757
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,910
I hope to ease our relation

758
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,800
and have more contacts.

759
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,080
Why?

760
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,390
I ask this world: what is love on earth

761
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,280
that binds the lovers up in life and death?

762
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,950
I fell in love with your Saintess

763
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,840
at first sight.

764
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,430
I planed the whole thing carefully

765
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,710
for Miss Duoduo's sake.

766
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,840
Your Majesty,

767
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,280
I'm mad

768
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,430
about Duoduo.

769
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,910
Please give us a chance.

770
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,800
Look.

771
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,950
The tree grows well.

772
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,360
The tree, it...

773
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,950
Well, what is this tree?

774
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,360
This tree looks so beautiful.

775
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,040
This tree...

776
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,630
It's...

777
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,520
It's green.

778
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,800
Well,

779
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,360
before I came to Beiqi,

780
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,840
I thought there would be

781
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,560
no grass

782
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
or tree here.

783
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,390
I didn't expect

784
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,000
it's so vibrant here.

785
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
It's full of vigor.

786
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,600
Well, how wonderful life is!

787
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,800
Well, you're laughing.

788
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,000
Fell in love with me at first sight?

789
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,040
I couldn't tell that old lady

790
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,670
I did everything

791
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,000
to kill Shen Zhong, right?

792
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,670
I just need an excuse.

793
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,600
Don't take it seriously.

794
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,910
You persuaded Shangshan Hu to follow the Empress Dowager

795
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,840
to kill Shen Zhong?

796
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,040
The Empress Dowager is sure

797
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,360
to be tempted by the military power.

798
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,910
But she won't kill Shen Zhong for that.

799
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,800
Now the border troops

800
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,670
are controlled by the Empress Dowager.

801
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,870
Haven't you gained approval from His Majesty?

802
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,910
This is the name list of

803
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,150
Shangshan Hu's subordinates in the army.

804
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,950
I copied it.

805
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,390
All the men on the list are generals and military officers.

806
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,950
To win them over or crack them down,

807
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,430
to take or lose the military power,

808
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,230
it's up to His Majesty.

809
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,630
Well, I didn't do you harm, right?

810
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,560
But Shen Zhong is still safe and sound.

811
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,080
Shen Zhong is talented and confident.

812
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,760
That is his strength,

813
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,430
but it might also get him killed.

814
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,630
Your Majesty, Fan Xian is

815
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,080
too cunning to be trusted.

816
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,800
He's young after all.

817
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,670
So many young men

818
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,710
in Shangjing Town fancy Duoduo.

819
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Fan Xian is no different.

820
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,360
Your Majesty, by thinking so,

821
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,910
I'm afraid you're tricked by Fan Xian already.

822
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,150
Is Her Majesty less wise

823
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,630
than you are?

824
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,190
I don't mean that.

825
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,040
Though Shen Zhong remains safe today,

826
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,670
the seeds have been sowed.

827
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,840
What seed?

828
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,360
Seeds of suspicion and fear.

829
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,630
By killing Xiao En,

830
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,840
Shen Zhong defied the Empress Dowager's order.

831
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,760
He didn't report

832
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,080
the smuggling, either.

833
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,800
The Empress Dowager didn't blame him.

834
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,470
But she'll remember it in heart.

835
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,800
After all, the Empress Dowager trusts him.

836
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,710
So if it happened before,

837
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,280
she wouldn't blame him at all.

838
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Even if she felt dissatisfied,

839
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,800
she would just let it go.

840
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,040
But now it's different.

841
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,040
What is different?

842
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,390
Now the Empress Dowager

843
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,230
has Shangshan Hu by her side.

844
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,520
Commander Shen, I'm delighted

845
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,630
that you're concerned about our country.

846
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,120
How can I blame you?

847
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,670
Your Majesty, you're really bright and perceptive.

848
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,950
The smuggling can

849
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,470
really be profitable.

850
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,870
In this case,

851
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,870
if we tell the truth,

852
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,630
Fan Xian will surely be punished by Nanqing.

853
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,120
His life is somewhat

854
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,390
controlled by us.

855
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,800
Your Majesty, please think twice.

856
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,950
We can't follow

857
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,520
our enemy's will.

858
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,320
No matter how much money,

859
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,470
we shouldn't be tempted.

860
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,320
Perhaps,

861
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,670
we can take the offer first, and see what happens later.

862
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,870
Forgive me for being outspoken.

863
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,190
We'd better be cautious.

864
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,950
Then I'll think it over.

865
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,760
Exactly.

866
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,710
Let's put it aside for the moment.

867
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,520
You may all leave.

868
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,230
I'm leaving.

869
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,470
Your Majesty, I bid you farewell.

870
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,150
As a first rank military official,

871
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,000
you don't have to kowtow to me.

872
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,910
Proprieties must be observed.

873
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,910
I'm loyal

874
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,630
in heart and in behavior.

875
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,910
Well said.

876
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,630
In heart and in behavior,

877
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,560
it's so well said.

878
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,520
Though Shen Zhong is important

879
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,390
for controlling the Embroidered Uniform Guards,

880
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,150
Shangshan Hu is more powerful

881
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,120
in the army.

882
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,230
The more cautious and low-pitched Shangshan Hu is,

883
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,430
the more arrogant and bossy Shen Zhong appears.

884
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,320
Your trick is too simple.

885
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm afraid the Empress Dowager can see through it.

886
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,190
Of course she understands

887
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,280
Shangshan Hu takes the chance

888
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
to attack Shen Zhong.

889
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,520
But it's an overt scheme.

890
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,950
Even if the Empress Dowager

891
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,000
understands it all,

892
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,320
she'll grow dissatisfied gradually.

893
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,710
People change. It's human nature.

894
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,360
Then it will be a situation of

895
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,470
check and balance at most.

896
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,360
The Empress Dowager won't kill Shen Zhong.

897
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,040
Someone will if she doesn't.

898
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,560
Do you have another plan?

899
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,840
Tell His Majesty that

900
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,910
I promised to kill Shen Zhong for him,

901
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,670
and I'll definitely make it happen.

902
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,910
That's what he said.

903
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,600
Exceptionally tactful and resourceful,

904
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,360
and good at writing books as well,

905
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,230
what an excellent man!

906
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,190
Did he copy the name list himself?

907
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,360
Yes.

908
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,870
His handwriting is poor.

909
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,390
Auntie, what else do you tell him?

910
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,560
Nothing else.

911
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,190
I just warned him

912
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,150
when he left.

913
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,560
About what?

914
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,660
In the river of history,

915
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,860
time goes round and round.

916
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,220
Memories about the former and present lives

917
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,100
join each other in an endless way.

918
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,700
In the long drunken Milky Way,

919
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,420
one season follows another in a flash,

920
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,620
and the wild geese are flying south.

921
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,540
I just can't give up

922
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,540
to be with you for my whole life.

923
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,820
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

924
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,620
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

925
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,500
Year after year in the wandering,

926
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,060
I count the remaining years.

927
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,260
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

928
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,820
even though we have ended up the destiny,

929
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,500
I never feel regretful.

930
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,460
In such a chaotic world,

931
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,220
I still miss you as ever.

932
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,860
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

933
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,580
With a gentle heart,

934
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,140
I cherish our remaining years.

935
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,980
Even though we have to go through

936
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,940
all the hardships along the journey,

937
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:28,260
you always stay by my side,

938
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,020
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

939
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,940
Year after year in the wandering,

940
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,300
I count the remaining years.

941
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,660
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

942
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,460
even though we end up the destiny,

943
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,900
I never feel regretful.

944
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,820
In such a chaotic world,

945
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,780
I still miss you as ever.

946
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,460
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

947
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,220
With a gentle heart,

948
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,620
I cherish our remaining years.

949
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,420
Even though we have to go through

950
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,580
all the hardships along the journey,

951
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:08,860
you always stay by my side...
