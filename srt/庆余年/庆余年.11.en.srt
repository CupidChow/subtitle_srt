1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 11

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,510
That day,

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,870
there were many guests.

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,590
The maidservant you're looking for

19
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,000
might not be from my mansion.

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,630
If so,

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,950
it won't be easy to find her.

22
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,440
What if I visit all the families

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,480
one by one?

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm afraid you'll probably be kicked out.

25
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,470
Maybe we should stop.

26
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,320
Actually, there's still another way.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,550
But it's much worse.

28
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,390
Even worse?

29
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,360
Sister, can I go home?

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,880
Ruoruo,

31
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,750
do you know Lin Wan'er?

32
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,240
I've met her several times and talked a few words.

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,110
Where does she live?

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,880
Sick with tuberculosis,

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,550
she stays in an imperial residence all the year round.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,440
She is the key to this marriage.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,550
Come on! Let's go to the imperial residence.

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,240
Are you going to

39
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,630
kill her?

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
Come with me.

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,030
You don't go inside?

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,110
I don't.

43
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,630
They are crazy!

44
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,360
Lady Ruoruo, wait a moment.

45
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,670
I will go and report.

46
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,440
Thank you.

47
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,390
Fan Ruoruo has gone to the imperial residence,

48
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,390
saying she has brought a famous doctor

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,600
to see Wan'er.

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,670
Auntie, why are you smiling so weirdly?

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,960
That doctor

52
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,830
is Fan Xian.

53
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,320
They're not married yet. How can they meet in private?

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,830
I heard that Fan Xian is the student of Fei Jie.

55
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,440
Those who are good at using poison are also doctors.

56
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,270
Let them see Wan'er.

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,720
Auntie,

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
aren't you against

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,950
the marriage all the time?

60
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,000
Fan Xian just left Prince Jing's mansion,

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,830
saying that he wants to find a maidservant.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,830
A drumstick girl.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
You heard about it?

64
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,480
A little bird told me.

65
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,110
Wan'er doesn't want to marry him.

66
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,760
Nor does Fan Xian.

67
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,350
The only person insist on them getting married

68
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,000
is His Majesty.

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,390
If Wan'er detests

70
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,040
or even hates Fan Xian,

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,950
then His Majesty might reconsider it.

72
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,000
I see.

73
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,720
By pretending to be a doctor,

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,270
Fan Xian wants to piss Wan'er,

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,320
so as to ruin the marriage.

76
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,720
In this sense,

77
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,160
I hope he can succeed.

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,790
Do you think he can see Lin Wan'er?

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,200
A patient suffers from a long illness
certainly wants to see a famous doctor.

80
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Choosing a maidservant

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,550
over a princess,

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,270
it's not worth it.

83
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,550
Indeed.

84
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,720
In this city,

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,950
only he will make such a choice.

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,830
Second Young Master!

87
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,740
=Lin Gong, the second son of Nanqing Prime Minister Lin Ruofu=

88
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,880
Fan Sizhe.

89
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,270
You must be Fan Xian!

90
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
Sorry to keep you waiting.

91
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Lady Ruoruo and doctor,

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
please follow me to see the princess.

93
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,480
Lustful, aggressive, mischievous and ignorant as he is,

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,670
Wan'er will never marry

95
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,070
your incorrigible brother.

96
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,230
Tell Fan Xian.

97
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,550
If he doesn't give up,

98
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,040
this is what he'll become.

99
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,950
Who's that?

100
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,040
Do you know who Lin Wan'er is?

101
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,920
She's the bastard daughter of the Princess Royal.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,270
Her birth father

103
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,600
is the current Prime Minister Lin Ruofu.

104
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,040
I've also heard that.

105
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,160
The Prime Minister has two sons.

106
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,830
That's Lin Gong,

107
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,720
the Second Young Master of

108
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,790
the Lin mansion.

109
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,440
So he's the second brother of Lin Wan'er.

110
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,640
Judged from his attitude,

111
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,640
he doesn't seem to like Fan Xian.

112
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,880
That's understandable.

113
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,880
If I were him, I wouldn't like Fan Xian, either.

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,390
Lin Gong

115
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,040
cares for Lin Wan'er

116
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,550
since childhood.

117
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,830
If I were in his shoes,

118
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,040
I wouldn't want my sister

119
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
to marry such a troublemaker.

120
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,000
Just think about all the troubles Fan Xian has caused

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,320
since he arrived in the capital city.

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
To be honest.

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,670
If it weren't for the strict rules of the Lin family,

124
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,510
short-tempered as he is,

125
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,600
he might have rushed into

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
our mansion long ago.

127
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,670
I've made my point.

128
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,000
Just leave!

129
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,600
Second Young Master, I've brought

130
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,440
a great doctor

131
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,600
to see Wan'er today.

132
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,110
Wan'er has got tuberculosis.

133
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,350
So many famous doctors failed to offer a solution.

134
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,160
Young as he is,

135
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
how dare you call him great?

136
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,200
What are you doing?

137
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,550
Go away!

138
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,000
Three!

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,720
Guards!

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,790
Kick this fraudulent quack

141
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,480
out!

142
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,950
Two!

143
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,320
Ridiculous!

144
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
One!

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,830
I was right!

146
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,350
His disease...

147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,600
You... you...

148
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,320
What did you do to me?

149
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,350
Just let me save him first!

150
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,670
His disease

151
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,950
can't be delayed.

152
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,040
His disease...

153
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,320
Your disease has been hidden

154
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,720
for a long time.

155
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,710
Luckily, you meet me today.

156
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,880
It can produce an excruciating pain in the chest.

157
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,470
Once broke out, it can't be delayed.

158
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,910
Or you'll die.

159
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,540
Take this pill right away!

160
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,320
Young Master, if you don't take it,

161
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,440
you'll die.

162
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,590
It's so effective!

163
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,280
What's the name of the disease?

164
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,350
It's called Why Giving Up.

165
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,470
What does it mean?

166
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,150
It means the disease is tricky.

167
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,440
Normally, the cause of the disease can't be figured out.

168
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,910
And eventually, the patient has to abandon treatment.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Why are you still here! Get out!

170
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,520
Yes!

171
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,150
I was wrong.

172
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,880
Master, you're really a great doctor!

173
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,030
Will you forgive my ignorance

174
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,710
and see my sister?

175
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,880
As doctors, we should be benevolent. Just lead the way.

176
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,520
I drugged him.

177
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,150
Second Young Master,

178
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,080
Lady Wan'er has lied down

179
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,400
as you commanded.

180
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,520
Master, sorry for this.

181
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,470
She's unmarried after all.

182
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,910
It's improper for her to show her face.

183
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,400
Master, please.

184
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm Fan Xian.

185
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,110
I'm here to see

186
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,880
what my future wife

187
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,640
looks like!

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm most certain that

189
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,080
by making such a fuss today,

190
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,200
you'll have to let me cancel the marriage!

191
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,110
Fan Xian!

192
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,440
Master.

193
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,150
I'm thinking about the disease.

194
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,640
I'll feel her pulse first.

195
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,080
I'm so sorry.

196
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,790
I'm also doing this for your benefit.

197
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,910
Master, sorry to trouble you.

198
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,000
Who... who are you?

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,590
Who is your Young Master?

200
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,880
Master, is there anything wrong?

201
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,080
To treat the disease, a guiding drug is needed.

202
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,640
What is it?

203
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,150
A greasy drumstick under the censer table

204
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,590
in the side palace hall of the Qing Temple.

205
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,520
Such a weird guiding drug.

206
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,000
Why are they still inside?

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,640
Lin Gong is inside, and so does Fan Xian.

208
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,590
Will they get into a fight

209
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,520
inside?

210
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
What's so good

211
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
about girls?

212
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,640
They are talkative and troublesome.

213
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
To me,

214
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,280
I might as well count the money!

215
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,910
You're still young.

216
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,080
I'm not!

217
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,590
Besides,

218
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,910
it's not relevant.

219
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,760
Why not have a try?

220
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,230
Try talking to a girl?

221
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,200
That one seems nice.

222
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,440
Should I have a try?

223
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,110
She's good.

224
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,000
Lady, wait a moment!

225
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,840
Would you like to

226
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760
play Pai Gow with me?

227
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,000
Who are you?

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,710
I'm the son of Earl Sinan.

229
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,910
Fan Xian?!

230
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,910
If I were Fan Xian,

231
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,550
will you play Pai Gow with me?

232
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,590
Nothing to look at! Let's go!

233
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,230
Girls are horrible!

234
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,280
What are you doing?

235
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,910
I'm seeing the patient.

236
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,030
Don't you need to feel her pulse?

237
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,520
Watching her face will do.

238
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,790
What do you get?

239
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,670
Does she often cough?

240
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,640
Right!

241
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,960
Does she pine away day by day?

242
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,640
Right!

243
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,880
Does she often sweat?

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,790
Right!

245
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,320
Does she often feel a hot flush?

246
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,320
Do you figure that out simply by watching her face?

247
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,080
Has she coughed blood?

248
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Yes, she has.

249
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,640
What's wrong with her?

250
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,710
I've confirmed the case.

251
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,230
It's tuberculosis.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
We've already know that.

253
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,440
No need for you to tell us!

254
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,350
It can be treated as long as I know her conditions.

255
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,910
Really?

256
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,520
What does she eat?

257
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,710
We've paid attention to that.

258
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,760
No meat and fish. Keep it plain and simple.

259
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,320
You're risking her life.

260
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,640
How is that?

261
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Tuberculosis is a chronic wasting disease.

262
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,790
She really needs to eat meat and fish.

263
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,150
If she seldom eats meat and fish,

264
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,350
she'll grow weak gradually.

265
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,910
Food such as drumsticks

266
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,200
can definitely be served more often.

267
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,790
I'm worried by eating meat,

268
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,200
I'll feel nauseated.

269
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,280
It's fine.

270
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,880
After vomiting several times, you'll just get used to it.

271
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,080
Is that OK?

272
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,110
I'll write a prescription for her later.

273
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,080
In addition,

274
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,150
open that window

275
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,230
more often.

276
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,470
She needs to breathe the fresh air.

277
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,520
Whether it should be closed or not at night,

278
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,590
it's up to the lady.

279
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,640
After all,

280
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,550
you have to prevent others from entering your room at night.

281
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,880
Second Young Master, see you later.

282
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,640
Lady Ruoruo,

283
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,000
the doctor is really talented.

284
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,110
Our family

285
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,320
really owes you this time.

286
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,910
But my mind has not changed.

287
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,200
I won't let your brother

288
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,520
marry Wan'er.

289
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,440
Because Wan'er already has someone

290
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,400
in her heart.

291
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,280
-Who? -What?

292
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,670
It must be Guo Baokun,

293
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,710
son of the Minister of the Board of Rites,

294
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,320
who serves as the imperial compiler.

295
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,230
Guo Bao...

296
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,470
Second Young Master, see you.

297
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,230
Guo Baokun?!

298
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,520
How could it be Guo Baokun?

299
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,040
Guo Baokun?

300
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,950
Second Young Master,

301
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,520
who's that?

302
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,070
A famous doctor invited by Ruoruo.

303
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,070
He's really good.

304
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,350
Why did you just stand there and watch me get kicked?

305
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,680
You're a swordsman after all.

306
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,160
She just

307
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
kicked me suddenly!

308
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,350
Why don't you help me?

309
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,430
Your brother is the one who pays me money,

310
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,280
not you.

311
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Then you've done nothing wrong.

312
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,350
Finally, you're out.

313
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,350
How could it be Guo Baokun?!

314
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,470
It's too dramatic!

315
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,520
Why is Guo Baokun involved?

316
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,560
She spat blood?

317
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,310
Just ask her

318
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,710
about it.

319
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,280
Don't you have a date with her tonight?

320
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,560
Sister,

321
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,590
a date with whom?

322
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,520
Lady Drumstick.

323
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,680
It's all set. They'll meet through a window.

324
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,920
Tidy up the room.

325
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,640
Yes.

326
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,000
I've heard that Fan Xian wants to cancel the marriage.

327
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,070
Fan Xian is so rude!

328
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,040
Do be relieved.

329
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,230
I won't let you marry

330
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,710
a vulgar man like him.

331
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,160
Dad is also to blame for this.

332
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
Powerful as he is,

333
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,520
he can turn down

334
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,400
the Fan family directly,

335
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,190
but he actually refuses to do it.

336
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,880
After all, I'm not a member of the Lin family.

337
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,560
Dad can't intervene.

338
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,520
How come you are not a member?

339
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,470
You're my younger sister.

340
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,560
You've been treated unfairly for so long.

341
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,560
You deserve to have

342
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,560
a satisfied marriage.

343
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,830
Rest assured.

344
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,640
If dad doesn't handle this, I will.

345
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,950
Haven't you been always saying that

346
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,520
you want to marry for love?

347
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
I'll make sure you do!

348
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,560
Whoever you like,

349
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
I'll get him for you even by force.

350
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,190
But the marriage is granted by His Majesty.

351
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,680
Our family has pledged loyalty to His Majesty.

352
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,350
But that doesn't mean girls of our family

353
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,760
should marry anyone chosen by His Majesty.

354
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
If we're pushed too hard,

355
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,070
we can defy the imperial order at the worst.

356
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,880
Brother, I know

357
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,880
you care about me.

358
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,350
It's so nice to have an elder brother!

359
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,950
Wan'er, let Ling'er keep you company.

360
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,160
Have some girl talks.

361
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,070
No need to worry about anything else.

362
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,110
But don't talk too late.

363
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,040
Go to sleep on time.

364
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,350
Fine.

365
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,640
Ling'er, it's cold outside.

366
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,830
Take Wan'er inside, please.

367
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,520
OK. Rest assured.

368
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,680
I'll send her to bed on time.

369
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,160
Are you staying tonight?

370
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,560
Yes.

371
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,640
You don't have to.

372
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,190
Moreover, open that window more often.

373
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,830
Whether it should be closed or not at night,

374
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,680
it's up to the lady.

375
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,350
After all,

376
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,040
you have to prevent others from entering your room at night.

377
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,880
Must it be tonight?

378
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,920
I haven't stayed here for a long time.

379
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,070
Well, you don't want me to stay over?

380
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,230
Lady Drumstick is Lin Wan'er!

381
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,800
Then the girl beat me just now must be...

382
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,920
Ye Ling'er.

383
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,430
No wonder.

384
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,160
Who's Ye Ling'er?

385
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,590
She's the only daughter of Ye Zhong,

386
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,160
the Chief Guard of the capital city.

387
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,920
I've never heard of him.

388
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,950
Ye Liuyun, who is among the Four Great Masters,

389
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,950
is her granduncle.

390
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,920
She's practiced martial arts since childhood.

391
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
And she just loves to fight.

392
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,920
Why did she beat you?

393
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,640
She thought I was you!

394
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,280
Then why does she want to beat me?

395
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,160
Because she's a close friend to Wan'er.

396
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,040
She must have heard the rumors about you.

397
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,590
So she doesn't want Wan'er to marry you.

398
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,280
I've decided.

399
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,800
After tonight,

400
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,160
I'll visit the Fan mansion.

401
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,040
For what?

402
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,350
Fan Xian has learned to practice martial arts.

403
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,880
I'll challenge him

404
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
and give him a good beat.

405
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,040
I will make him give up the marriage.

406
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,590
Don't stand here. You might catch a cold.

407
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,040
Let me close the window for you.

408
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,310
Don't touch!

409
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,950
Will the carriage turn over?

410
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,660
What happened?

411
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,110
Is there anyone?

412
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,110
The heaven, earth and man exist in harmony.

413
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,400
Gentlemen shall not stay up for work.

414
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,680
It's midnight already.

415
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,310
Don't cause any trouble recently.

416
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,000
Why do you say so?

417
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,710
Your dad has agreed to break off the engagement.

418
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,800
Recently, he's been thinking about

419
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,760
your words.

420
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,310
Then he realized you're right.

421
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,280
Right for what?

422
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,880
Compared to the financial power of the Neiku,

423
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,590
perhaps your mom

424
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,800
would rather see you

425
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,880
with someone you love.

426
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,760
He said he would plead to His Majesty

427
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,400
to cancel the engagement,

428
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,760
so that you can find that Lady Drumstick.

429
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,800
Whatever

430
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,830
her status is,

431
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,000
he will support you

432
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,310
as long as you like her.

433
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,680
You've been quarreled over this for so long.

434
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,880
It's not easy for him

435
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,190
to admit his mistake right away.

436
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,280
I just said all these

437
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,590
on his behalf.

438
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,070
Well...

439
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,230
I've also thought about it for a long time.

440
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,000
What about

441
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,000
we keep this marriage?

442
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,590
What?

443
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,110
You're the one who wanted to break off the engagement.

444
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,070
Now suddenly,

445
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,110
you want to keep it instead.

446
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,310
Don't be mad!

447
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,160
I know

448
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,830
it's complicated.

449
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,070
What should I do? What should I do?

450
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,040
How about this?

451
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,110
I need to go out now.

452
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,000
I'll give you an answer tomorrow morning.

453
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,110
It's so late. Where are you going?

454
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,920
Well...

455
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,110
Wan'er, the water is ready.

456
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,310
Go and wash up.

457
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,520
What are you looking at?

458
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,190
Nothing.

459
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,800
It's cold at night.

460
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,310
I'll close the window.

461
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,070
Why close it?

462
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,800
Today, didn't the doctor ask you

463
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,640
to open the window more often for good ventilation?

464
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,350
Just go and wash up.

465
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,920
The water will be cold after a while.

466
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,310
Just go!

467
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,710
I'll make the bed for you.

468
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,040
You're back.

469
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,470
I've left you some food.

470
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,470
I'll heat it up.

471
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,680
No need to bother.

472
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,070
I'm not that hungry.

473
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,560
It's fine.

474
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,110
Why did he go to bed so early today?

475
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,350
Another day of hard play.

476
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,800
Later,

477
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll ask Fan Xian to find him a teacher.

478
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,830
He should be studying now.

479
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,310
That's terrific!

480
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,160
He's becoming wild

481
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,920
after running about in the city all day long.

482
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,560
He just told me that

483
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,880
today he got to know

484
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
a new friend

485
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
living in a box

486
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,710
and locked by chains.

487
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,590
He's just a kid after all.

488
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,110
Would you like a drumstick?

489
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,920
Why are you here?

490
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,590
If I say I'm here to deliver the night snack,

491
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,560
will you believe me?

492
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,000
You're a doctor in the day,

493
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,430
but a pervert at night!

494
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,920
That's not true! That's not true!

495
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,640
You misunderstood me! You!

496
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,160
I'm gonna kill you! Pervert!

497
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,280
You hit me so hard!

498
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Can you be gentle?

499
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,640
Dapiguan Palm!

500
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,680
If you don't stop, I'll fight back!

501
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,560
Stop! I'm not a pervert!

502
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,710
You can ask Wan'er if you don't believe me.

503
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,710
You are good!

504
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,350
You're so violent!

505
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,230
Wait for me here.

506
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,040
Yes.

507
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,950
She started it!

508
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,950
I brought it for you.

509
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,520
Does it hurt?

510
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,070
I hardly hit her!

511
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,470
Are you

512
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,520
having a date?

513
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,160
A princess and a doctor

514
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
who are not afraid of worldly prejudice

515
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,280
get together despite the difference of their statuses.

516
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,950
It's just like

517
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,230
the stories.

518
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,280
What kind of stories

519
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,310
do you usually read?

520
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,880
You're good at martial arts.

521
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,920
The palm technique

522
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,880
you used

523
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,710
right here

524
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,830
is really smart!

525
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,880
Which one?

526
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,400
This one! This one!

527
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,110
You flatter me.

528
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,680
Your palm techniques are actually marvelous.

529
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,400
What I used is called Dapiguan Palm!

530
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,310
Fine. Fine.

531
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,040
I lost to you because I'm lame.

532
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
It doesn't mean the martial arts

533
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,470
handed down by my family are lame.

534
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,000
Sure. Sure.

535
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,760
If you didn't step on that,

536
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,560
I would never defeat you.

537
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,040
That's not the case.

538
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,760
I've thought about it.

539
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,800
You led me here

540
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,280
deliberately

541
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,470
just now.

542
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,910
I won't deny my loss.

543
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,390
No need to comfort me.

544
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,630
You've got another move.

545
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,840
What's this called?

546
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,710
Like this!

547
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,910
Well.

548
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,710
I haven't named it yet.

549
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,120
It's just a small trick! See?

550
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,840
Awesome! Awesome!

551
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,520
Also! Also!

552
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,190
You've got another move.

553
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,230
Right, Wan'er!

554
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,150
You didn't see it.

555
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,870
He's got a really awesome move!

556
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,950
Can you repeat...

557
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,150
Sorry.

558
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,190
I'm just too obsessed.

559
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,710
You two should talk in private.

560
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,800
I'll see myself out.

561
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,870
I won't let anyone get close!

562
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,840
Just talk.

563
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,280
I finally find you.

564
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,230
What for?

565
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,710
I don't know.

566
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,760
I just want to see you.

567
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,470
Really?

568
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,150
Really!

569
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,150
Since we met last time

570
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,390
in the Qing Temple,

571
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,910
The happiest thing I feel

572
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,840
is when I dream every day.

573
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,360
Because I can see you

574
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,520
in my dreams.

575
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,840
I was scared

576
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,080
every time I woke up.

577
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,080
I was scared that

578
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,150
we could only meet each other once.

579
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,630
I was afraid that

580
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,670
I could never see you again.

581
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,360
Now it's all right!

582
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,470
I've found you!

583
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,320
I feel so relived after finding you.

584
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,870
You're really a good talker.

585
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,520
It must be a skill cultivated

586
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,560
through dealing with women all the time.

587
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,150
Is there any misunderstanding

588
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,040
between us?

589
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,520
I don't think so.

590
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,320
You said you were the servant of Guo Baokun.

591
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,390
I've sent Ling'er to ask him.

592
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,430
Guo Baokun has stopped using

593
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,560
a servant for a long time.

594
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,630
I see.

595
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,710
You went to Guo Baokun to...

596
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,470
Don't move!

597
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,950
...inquire about me?

598
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,470
How rude and presumptuous of you

599
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,910
to break into my boudoir at night!

600
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,840
I've given you a hit in the day.

601
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,670
Don't move!

602
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,840
If you really don't want to see me,

603
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,670
you'll take out the dagger

604
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,630
when the other girl was here.

605
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,670
This is an imperial residence.

606
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,870
If you really get caught,

607
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,320
you'll be sentenced to death.

608
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,320
So you worry...

609
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,870
You...

610
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,800
I've known you after all,

611
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,910
so I don't want to see you die.

612
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,430
But

613
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
I don't want to hear

614
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
your sweet talks, either.

615
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,190
You really think

616
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,390
I am

617
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,670
frivolous?

618
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,000
Just leave.

619
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,150
Listen.

620
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,390
The window needs to be opened for good ventilation.

621
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,430
What are you doing?

622
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,230
But it's cold at night.

623
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,470
-You'd better close it. -You...

624
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,670
I ask you to leave. Don't you understand?

625
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,600
Put it down! Put it down!

626
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,600
Leave!

627
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,870
Well...

628
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,230
Just leave!

629
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,280
Calm down!

630
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,190
I'll leaving now!

631
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,710
I agree to leave,

632
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,230
not because I admit being dissolute.

633
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,390
I'm afraid that you might hurt yourself.

634
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,360
But every word

635
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,390
I just said

636
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,230
is from the bottom of my heart.

637
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,120
I never mean to show disrespect.

638
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,950
Wait!

639
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,230
Who on earth are you?

640
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,760
What's your name?

641
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,670
I'm Fan Xian.

642
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,040
Who do you think I am?

643
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,910
How dare you humiliate me like this?

644
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,760
I'm really Fan Xian!

645
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,910
You know I'm engaged to him,

646
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,230
so you said his name on purpose

647
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,120
to tease me.

648
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,320
It's not true.

649
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm Fan Xian.

650
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,080
Fan Xian is me.

651
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,800
I've been called Fan Xian

652
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,670
for so many years.

653
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,320
I'm Fan Xian for real!

654
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,560
Vulgar as he is,

655
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,910
I've already seen him.

656
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,390
Actually, you pointed him to me

657
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,120
on the poetry gathering.

658
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,630
I have my reasons.

659
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,230
I'll explain to you later.

660
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,840
How is Fan Xian a vulgar man?

661
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
He beat people on the streets.

662
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,080
He's arrogant and impolite.

663
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,950
Everyone knows about that.

664
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,710
If you want to know a man,

665
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,520
you need to meet him in person.

666
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,470
You can't believe the rumors.

667
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,150
What about fooling around

668
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,040
with the singing girl on the carriage?

669
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
I've never done that.

670
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,320
Then you can't be Fan Xian.

671
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
You're misled by rumors.

672
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,360
I've seen it with my own eyes.

673
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,040
I remember.

674
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,320
Fan Sizhe was on that carriage.

675
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,390
I was not there.

676
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,560
You've misunderstood me.

677
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,230
Stop justifying yourself!

678
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,390
Listen!

679
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,280
If you continue to be disrespectful,

680
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,560
I can really hurt myself.

681
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,870
Ruoruo came with me in the day.

682
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,910
If I'm not Fan Xian,

683
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,760
how would Ruoruo

684
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,840
take a strange man

685
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,430
to see her future sister-in-law?

686
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,080
You've lived in the capital city for a long time.

687
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,520
You should know what kind of a person Ruoruo is.

688
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,430
She won't be so rude.

689
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,800
You...

690
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,840
How can you believe me?

691
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,190
Write down that poem.

692
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,600
Lady Ye, why are you standing here?

693
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,760
I...

694
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,630
I'm appreciating the beauty of the night.

695
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,190
I did hear

696
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,320
noise upstairs.

697
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,560
I was practicing martial arts upstairs.

698
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,800
I might have made some noise.

699
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,150
Princess is sick and weak.

700
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,000
Why would you practice martial arts

701
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,230
in front of her?

702
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,520
I'll check her up.

703
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,120
Wan'er is asleep.

704
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,150
Even if she is,

705
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,600
I'm responsible for checking her up.

706
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,000
Lady Ye, why do you stop me?

707
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,390
You can't go inside!

708
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,840
It's really you!

709
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,360
Many people know this poem.

710
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,870
Why are you sure it's me?

711
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,080
Indeed! Many people know this poem,

712
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,840
but only one person

713
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,430
writes so ugly.

714
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,760
Li Hongcheng gave it to me.

715
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,320
Do you believe me now?

716
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,000
How can you be...

717
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,150
No need to go inside!

718
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,600
Wan'er is really asleep!

719
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,390
Get out of the way!

720
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,040
You really don't have to check her up!

721
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,360
I told you she's asleep!

722
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,620
In the river of history,

723
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,820
time goes round and round.

724
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,180
Memories about the former and present lives

725
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,060
join each other in an endless way.

726
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,660
In the long drunken Milky Way,

727
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,380
one season follows another in a flash,

728
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,580
and the wild geese are flying south.

729
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,500
I just can't give up

730
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,500
to be with you for my whole life.

731
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,780
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

732
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,580
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

733
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,460
Year after year in the wandering,

734
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,020
I count the remaining years.

735
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,220
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

736
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,780
even though we have ended up the destiny,

737
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,460
I never feel regretful.

738
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,420
In such a chaotic world,

739
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,180
I still miss you as ever.

740
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,820
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

741
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,540
With a gentle heart,

742
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,100
I cherish our remaining years.

743
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,940
Even though we have to go through

744
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,900
all the hardships along the journey,

745
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:42,220
you always stay by my side,

746
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,980
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

747
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,900
Year after year in the wandering,

748
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,260
I count the remaining years.

749
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,620
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

750
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,420
even though we end up the destiny,

751
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,860
I never feel regretful.

752
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,780
In such a chaotic world,

753
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,740
I still miss you as ever.

754
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,420
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

755
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,180
With a gentle heart,

756
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,580
I cherish our remaining years.

757
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,380
Even though we have to go through

758
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,540
all the hardships along the journey,

759
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:22,820
you always stay by my side...
