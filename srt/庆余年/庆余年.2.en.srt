17
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,660
These people are here to take me to the capital?

18
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,740
Who told them to come?

19
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,170
Naturally, it was your father.

20
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,860
I already rejected them.

21
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,010
The capital isn't a good place.

22
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,420
Your mother died in the capital.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,360
You will live longer if you stay here.

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,470
But they're still kneeling outside.

25
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,020
Let them kneel.

26
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,260
Once they kneel to death, clean up their bodies.

27
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,110
Uncle, should I go to the capital?

28
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,160
I remember Young Miss once did business in the capital.

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,710
What else?

30
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,550
I don't remember clearly anymore.

31
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,520
So you mean I should go?

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,690
You should decide for yourself.

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,840
My mother died in the capital. Are her killers still there?

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,520
I don't know.

35
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,990
I want to go to the capital.

36
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,480
But what if there's danger?

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,090
It's up to you.

38
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,370
What are you looking at?

39
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,480
I've been thinking about a question.

40
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,060
Once I become old,

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,430
are you still not going to age?

42
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,660
Grandmother.

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,260
Old Madam.

44
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,750
Those soldiers wouldn't even eat our food.

45
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,420
If we treat them this poorly, I'm afraid it'll look bad.

46
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,530
- Old Madam, I–
- Eat.

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,660
I like this one.

48
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,630
How fresh! Where is it from?

49
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,030
He's asking a question.

50
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,090
Old Ha's nephew sent it over here this morning.

51
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,360
Doesn't Old Ha usually bring it?

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,340
Why was it his nephew?

53
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,230
Old Ha is sick, so his nephew brought it over. Is something wrong?

54
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,180
Has his nephew been here before?

55
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,220
It should be the first time.

56
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,990
What is it?

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,040
Nothing.

58
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,120
Grandmother, I'm full. I'll take my leave.

59
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
Old Madam, I'm not trying to be nosy.

60
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,650
One plate of bamboo shoots is nothing.

61
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,570
But it's too arrogant in this manner.

62
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm also making this comment from how I personally feel.

63
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,420
Young Master!

64
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,030
- Did you eat bamboo shoots?
- I did!

65
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,850
I–! Young Master!

66
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,530
Young Master, I don't know what happened, everyone is suddenly throwing up!

67
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,910
Come with me!

68
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,310
Take this!

69
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,070
Let them drink more cow's milk.

70
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,050
They'll be fine once they throw up! Come, come, come.

71
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,570
Where are those people wearing red clothes?

72
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,340
They asked where Old Ha lives, then left!

73
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,240
Come, come, come! Go, go!

74
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,450
Drink more cow's milk!

75
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,670
Everyone, drink some.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,230
<i>This, this, this!</i>

77
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,160
Hold up!

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,420
What are you going to do?

79
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,450
Someone stole poison. They must be killed!

80
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,660
Old Ha sent food over to the manor for many years. He was probably made a hostage.

81
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,790
If you rush in there, he'll die!

82
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,100
Move aside!

83
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,000
- I am Fan Xian!
- Move aside!

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,030
What if it's a diversion tactic?

85
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,990
Leave this place to me.

86
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,810
Let me borrow a sword.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,550
Old Ha!

88
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,470
Did you put the poison in the bamboo shoots?

89
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,250
<i>[Teng Zijing: Member of the Fourth Division; Inspection and Control Bureau of Southern Qing]</i>

90
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,990
Damn, Doraemon?

91
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,900
You've lost.

92
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,330
You put poison on your knife?

93
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,130
Let me ask you something before you die.

94
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,770
Why didn't you let those soldiers in?

95
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,480
For a person who delivers food,

96
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,520
you would put your life in danger?

97
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,910
You lost your life for nothing!

98
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,490
What a coincidence!

99
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,620
There was also poison on my sword!

100
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,160
You're okay?

101
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,890
Let me tell you. I've been consuming poison since I was a child.

102
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,730
Regular poison won't do anything against me.

103
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,870
Did you put poison in the food?

104
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,750
Why didn't you use arsenic?

105
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,370
I only need to kill you.

106
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,740
Then, why do you want to kill me?

107
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,340
The Control Bureau's secret order! Kill the country's criminal!

108
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,950
You're from the Control Bureau?

109
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,900
If you kill me, someone else will come.

110
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,880
If the Control Bureau wants to kill someone, they won't let him–!

111
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,260
Waist badge from Control Bureau? Where did you get this from?

112
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,690
One of the Control Bureau's master of poisons, Fei Jie, is my teacher.

113
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,260
You don't believe me? My mother died early.

114
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,020
I have no status in the Fan household. I grew up in Danzhou.

115
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,660
My father never came to see me even once.

116
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,870
I'll say, I'm just an illegitimate son.

117
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,060
What right do I have to become the country's criminal?

118
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,010
Because I'm handsome?

119
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,790
You're an illegitimate son?

120
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,740
So, look. There must be something wrong with the Control Bureau's secret order.

121
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,030
We can talk properly. What do you think?

122
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,570
Also, let me ask you something.

123
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,250
Fan Manor has tight security. This is your first time here.

124
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,910
How did you manage to impersonate Old Ha's nephew?

125
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,360
Who's protecting you?

126
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,250
You were the one who worked with the killer to poison the food? <i>[House Manager Zhou: Danzhou's Fan Family House Manager]</i>

127
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,240
But looking at things, Grandmother probably knows.

128
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,130
<i>[Old Madam Fan: Mother of Southern Qing's Earl of Sinan, Fan Jian]</i>

129

Old Madam! All I did was for the Fan family!

130
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,500
Don't rush. Talk slowly.

131
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,790
Xian'er, kneel down and listen.

132
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,060
I was sent by the second madam.

133
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,080
She wanted me to watch Fan Xian.

134
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,500
If this brat reaches the capital, he'll definitely fight for the inheritance!

135
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,930
Rather than letting him mess up the household, why not keep him from reaching the capital instead?

136
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,350
Besides, the Control Bureau wants to kill him this time.

137
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,420
I only assisted them!

138
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,250
That's true.

139
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,200
For the Fan family, you cannot be softhearted.

140
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,440
Xian'er, you must remember this principle.

141
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,160
Now that you've grown up, you must learn to be cruel!

142
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,180
I understand.

143
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,930
Men!

144
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,650
Old Madam.

145
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,860
Break his legs and throw him onto a fishing ship.

146
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,950
He doesn't need to reach shore ever again!

147
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,440
Yes.

148
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,390
No! No! No!

149
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,400
No! No! No!

150
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,080
Old Madam! Haven't you always disliked Fan Xian?

151
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,790
This was all fake!

152
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,810
Fake!

153
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,240
He received a letter from Liu Ruyu

154
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,500
to cooperate with others to kill you.

155
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,640
What do you think?

156
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,880
Second Mother always sends me gifts during the holidays.

157
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,040
She treats me pretty well. I remember that.

158
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,090
That's true. One letter cannot determine guilt.

159
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,510
I will have your father investigate this carefully.

160
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,850
We must have a result.

161
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,330
Grandmother, how about I go investigate it myself?

162
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,260
You want to go to the capital?

163
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,600
Didn't we agree you'd stay here?

164
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,650
I will talk to your father.

165
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,400
Grandmother, look, I'm already such a grown man now.

166
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,030
I have to see the world!

167
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,160
Since there was a first killer, there will be a second.

168
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,780
I've already been hidden for so long, but they still won't let go of me.

169
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,320
Why don't I go up there myself?

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,220
You've made up your mind.

171
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,980
I'll come back once it's all settled.

172
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,400
What if it's really Liu Ruyu?

173
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,340
Then I'll tell Second Mother I have no intention of fighting for the inheritance.

174
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,510
I was just telling you to learn to be cruel.

175
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,790
You must be careful.

176
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,870
Don't worry! I'm a ghost.

177
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,720
When are you heading out?

178
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,390
Tomorrow.

179
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,630
Then... Then I won't see you off tomorrow.

180
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,990
I'm getting old. I can't see separation.

181
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,220
Go back and get ready.

182
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,570
<i>The Old Madam certainly is cruel.</i>

183
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,060
<i>He can't ever return to shore.</i>

184
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,190
I heard your relationship with the Old Madam has never been good.

185
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,290
Killers have been after me since childhood. I was always afraid of dragging down my family members.

186
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,710
So you were making the Old Madam to be cold to you, but you were actually protecting her?

187
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,510
I have to leave now.

188
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,850
There's no need to pretend anymore.

189
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,080
Thank you for helping me this time.

190
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,310
You don't need to thank me. The Control Bureau has already sent a notice over.

191
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,730
They said the order to kill you was fake.

192
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,240
Someone wants to borrow the Control Bureau's hand to get rid of you.

193
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,510
Who?

194
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,250
Still investigating.

195
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,030
Once I get to the capital, I will definitely find the answer.

196
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,500
Fan Xian, do me a favor.

197
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,820
Speak.

198
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,920
Please kill me.

199
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,100
What did you say?

200
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,500
Please kill me!

201
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,330
What's your name?

202
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,020
Teng Zijing from the Control Bureau.

203
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,700
Boss, I'm buying a pair of scissors.

204
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,780
I'm putting the money here.

205
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,840
I'm taking the scissors!

206
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,380
He took away quite a lot!

207
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,210
I know.

208
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,890
It doesn't matter if this shop makes money or not.

209
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,630
You stayed in Danzhou to protect me.

210
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,130
Yes.

211
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,060
Uncle, I'm going to the capital.

212
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,520
Okay.

213
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,430
I didn't tell you about the assassination attempt.

214
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,580
Do you know why I kept it from you?

215
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,920
I don't know.

216
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,050
Because I want to tell you, that even without you helping me,

217
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,770
I can still live well in this world.

218
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,020
I've already grown up.

219
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,590
Good.

220
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,870
For as long as I can remember, you've always watched over me.

221
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,990
As long as you are here, I'm not afraid of anything.

222
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,410
But this isn't right.

223
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,350
What isn't right?

224
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,940
The chef, Old Liu, likes fishing.

225
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,950
Xiao Ma who watches the front door likes watching girls.

226
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,430
Everyone has their own hobbies.

227
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,980
What about you? What do you like?

228
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,680
Nothing.

229
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,490
Is there someone you like?

230
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,750
Something you want to do? A life plan?

231
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,050
Sometimes I think you live only for me.

232
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
This isn't fair to you.

233
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,900
You don't need me?

234
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,550
I will always need you.

235
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,460
But, Uncle, to me, you're not just a guardian.

236
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,920
You are also my most important family member.

237
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,110
So I hope you can find something you want to do.

238
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,300
Do you understand what I'm saying?

239
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,230
I don't really understand.

240
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,940
Uncle, I'm going to the capital tomorrow.

241
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,630
I will go find the one who wants to kill me and search for my mother's story.

242
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,570
I will live better than anyone else.

243
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,300
Because this is what I've wanted to do.

244
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,320
That's very good.

245
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:31,680
I hope you can also find what you want to do and live for yourself.

246
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,880
Find what I want to do.

247
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,320
Live for myself.

248
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,220
Find what I want to do.

249
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,590
Live for myself.

250
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,360
Uncle Wu, can you stop just appearing like that?

251
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,460
I remember.

252
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,170
What do you remember?

253
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,400
What you said this afternoon, Young Miss also once said it.

254
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,670
She wanted me to find what I liked to do.

255
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,680
Then, did you find it?

256
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,630
I want to open it.

257
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,280
Young Miss left this behind.

258
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,650
My mother? What's inside?

259
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,150
I don't know.

260
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,710
You never opened it?

261
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,360
- Young Miss didn't say I could.
- Then, what about now?

262
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,500
I thought about it for a long time.

263
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,080
In this world, the thing I want to do most

264
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,990
is to open this case.

265
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,000
I want to see what Young Miss left behind.

266
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,590
You two must have gone through a lot in the past.

267
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,250
I forget.

268
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,650
Come, let's open it.

269
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,610
I don't have a key.

270
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,050
Wait a moment.

271
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,870
Wait a moment. I'll use a different knife.

272
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,470
This is too durable!

273
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,980
What is this case made of?

274
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,730
I don't know.

275
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,300
What sort of skin is this strong?

276
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,750
Where did my mother get it from?

277
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,280
I forget.

278
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
Where is the key?

279
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,390
The capital. So, I will go there, too.

280
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,660
Let's go tomorrow together.

281
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,010
I will head out first. Let's meet up in the capital.

282
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,750
What about this case?

283
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,470
I'll leave it with you.

284
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,320
What is this made of?

285
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,540
- Girl.
- Old Madam.

286
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,210
Did Young Master leave already?

287
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,380
Why don't we go take a look?

288
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,220
There's no need.

289
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,800
Yes.

290
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,600
This child has big ideas.

291
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,420
He has to leave eventually.

292
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,970
<i>Young Master.</i>

293
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,170
I already said I wouldn't send you off.

294
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,250
This... This looks ridiculous!

295
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,940
Take care of yourself. Once I get matters straight,

296
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,890
I'll come get you.

297
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,850
Young Master, the water is boiling. You'll have to wait a bit for food.

298
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,440
That's fine.  Get to work. I'm going to get some exercise.

299
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,980
Yes.

300
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,850
Young Master.

301
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,640
Young Master.

302
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,610
Young Master.

303
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,930
- Teng--!
- Young Master, what hurts?

304
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,600
It's fine!

305
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,500
No! What are you doing here?

306
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,970
I want to return to the capital, too.

307
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,090
Didn't you tell me to spread the news that you were dead?

308
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,640
Yes. On the surface, you did kill me.

309
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,130
I can't move about openly.

310
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,040
So, I won't be searched if I follow your caravan.

311
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,200
My soldiers know you?

312
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,880
They don't! But they know money.

313
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,530
Why are you going to the capital?

314
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,450
It has nothing to do with you.

315
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,400
I don't have to ask.

316
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,260
This time in the capital, I will find out who wants to kill me.

317
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,450
Wasn't it Liu Ruyu, your second mother?

318
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,130
I want to know what skills she used to confuse the Control Bureau.

319
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,120
I don't know about that.

320
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,580
You can help me investigate.

321
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,840
Let's work together in the capital. Your dead identity is the most useful.

322
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,040
Why should I help you?

323
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,980
You don't want to know who tricked you?

324
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,680
I don't.

325
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,220
You're the one asking for help to get into the capital!

326
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,050
Fine. Let me think about it once we reach the capital.

327
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,700
Come back here!

328
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,940
I feel your attitude is too perfunctory.

329
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,140
You have to prepare for a wedding once you get to the capital.

330
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,090
You have no time to investigate these things.

331
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,780
What wedding?

332
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,660
Aren't you getting married in the capital? No one told you?

333
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,960
No one! How do you know?

334
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,990
After I got the order to kill you,

335
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,160
I did some investigation to get to know you better.

336
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
- No, then who am I--?
- I don't know.

337
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,250
My order was to kill you, not your entire family.

338
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,410
Why would I need to know that much?

339
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,440
This. Your wedding gift.

340
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,450
I wish that you have a long marriage and have lots of children.

341
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,590
I'm going to start the fire.

342
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,430
What are you doing?

343
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,170
The merchant caravan in front of us is from the Control Bureau.

344
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,370
<i>[Fei Jie: Head of Third Division; Inspection and Control Bureau of Southern Qing]</i>

345
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,030
Fortunately, I have sharp eyes. The merchant caravan was from the Fourth Bureau.

346
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:28,270
Also, your teacher is so formidable and he's traveling with the caravan to protect it.

347
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,370
Something big must have happened.

348
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,160
Stop the carriage!

349
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,900
What are you doing?

350
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,050
Master Fei, we've done an investigation. This inn is clean.

351
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,640
Okay, stay here to rest.

352
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,150
Yes.

353
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,340
I'm taking a walk around to see if anything is amiss.

354
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,970
<i>Okay.</i>

355
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,770
I knew you'd follow me!

356
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,340
Where did you get this?

357
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,120
There's a fruit orchard nearby.

358
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,520
Where are you going?

359
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,610
- Northern Qi.
- Northern Qi?

360
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,560
Aren't we always fighting with them?

361
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,500
A war will break out soon.

362
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,120
The Control Bureau established a spy network in Northern Qi a long time ago.

363
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,350
Their achievement isn't great. They don't have a leader.

364
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,640
They're having you go over there?

365
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,600
Me? I'm good at poisons.

366
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,090
I'm sending someone there.

367
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,390
- The person in the carriage?
- Yes.

368
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,740
Yan Ruohai's son, Yan Bingyun. He's young and talented.

369
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,970
They could bear to send someone like that to an enemy country?

370
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,320
It's all for you.

371
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Because of me?

372
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,900
You killed Teng Zijing who's a spy from the Fourth Division of the Control Bureau.

373
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,230
The people from the Fourth Division went against their own subordinates.

374
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,960
Yan Ruohai must take responsibility for that.

375
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,790
Teng Zijing is Yan Bingyun's subordinate.

376
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,630
The Control Bureau Head fired him out of anger.

377
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,190
He was ordered to take his subordinates and pretend to be merchants

378
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,060
and go to Northern Qi to take over the spy network.

379
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,970
It's a major issue. Even if it's considered seeing him off, it's also considered as protecting the carriage.

380
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,550
I killed someone from our side. Am I going to be punished?

381
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,990
Teng Zijing is not from a direct descendant of the Control Bureau.

382
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,360
He had only joined for a few years. It's fine if he's killed.

383
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,950
Count yourself lucky this time.

384
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,160
Why?

385
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,300
Fourth Division is responsible for secret investigations. Sixth Division is responsible for assassinations.

386
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,650
The arms of the other parties are not that long. The fake order didn't reach the Sixth Division.

387
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,550
That's how the spy of the Fourth Division could take action.

388
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,990
If people from the Sixth Division really set out, it would be a great problem.

389
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,900
So there was so much going on behind this?

390
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,590
All right, just accompany me to here.

391
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,430
Let me tell you.

392
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,820
No matter what happens, wait for me to come back.

393
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,960
Also, when you next pass by pears,

394
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,660
choose those which are plump and juicy.

395
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,610
Only those are sweet.

396
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,330
<i>Fan Xian.</i>

397
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,950
Yan Bingyun?

398
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,100
Are you blocking me to get revenge for Teng Zijing?

399
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,260
<i>Teng Zijing didn't deserve to die.</i>

400
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,700
I already killed him. What do you want?

401
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,160
<i>Hand over the Control Bureau waist badge to me.</i>

402
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,420
You intend to forcibly snatch it from me?

403
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,930
<i>Give it to me.</i>

404
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,170
- Come on.
- Yan Bingyun.

405
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,390
Remember the order I gave you.

406
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,360
Before we reach Northern Qi,

407
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,380
you cannot leave this horse carriage.

408
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,530
<i>Fan Xian is cruel, violent, and stubborn.</i>

409
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:18,220
<i>By leaving this waist badge to him, it's not advantageous to the Control Bureau and Qing State.</i>

410
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,780
If you can get off this horse carriage,

411
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,450
Northern Qi's spy plan will be destroyed.

412
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,180
When that happens, the one who is harming the Qin Empire

413
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,650
is you, Yan Bingyun!

414
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,130
<i>Even if I don't get off the carriage, I can still take his token!</i>

415
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,620
Whoever makes a move, won't breathe beyond three breaths.

416
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,310
<i>Go back.</i>

417
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,800
That's more like it.

418
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,660
Go back and rest. We have to continue our journey tomorrow.

419
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,690
<i>Fan Xian! We will meet again!</i>

420
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,820
He won't be coming back for a while.

421
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,990
<i>[Jingdu]</i>

422
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,380
Wait.

423
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,210
Young Master Fan.

424
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,780
You traveled all the way from Danzhou to the capital.

425
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,860
You've worked hard.

426
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,270
Do I know you?

427
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,820
I have long respected and admired you. I hated myself for not having met you.

428
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,300
It is my great fortune to meet you today!

429
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,040
Fine. Let's find a day to talk.

430
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,290
I'm still busy and have to return to the manor today. I'll be leaving first.

431
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,860
Wait!

432
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,300
- You want to search me?
- I don't dare.

433
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,890
I have something I'd like you to see.

434
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,700
This map has full details of the beautiful scenery of Jingdu.

435
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,890
This is your first time in the capital. Perhaps you'll find it helpful.

436
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,980
<i>[Detailed Map of Beautiful Scenery of Jingdu]</i>

437
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,680
Thanks.

438
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,710
It's two coins.

439
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,910
Two coins?!

440
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,740
This map was written on top quality paper,

441
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,260
using a top-quality brush pen. I have devoted a lot of blood, sweat, and tears,

442
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,890
checked back and forth, and drew it myself.

443
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,160
Moreover, this is the last map.

444
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,280
Two coins...

445
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,770
aren't even enough for me to drink some tea!

446
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,200
Two coins, here.

447
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,630
Let's go.

448
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,160
This is even more than two coins!

449
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,250
Everyone, I'll take my leave.

450
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,420
Old Wang! How many of those dumb maps did you sell?

451
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,460
All the rich young masters in the city have bought one.

452
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,660
You're not afraid of being beaten?

453
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,580
For those rich young masters, two coins are nothing!

454
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,920
Besides, in the capital, there are lots of crafty people!

455
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,130
I'm helping them to mature from experience.

456
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,100
I admit this.

<i>[Royal Palace]</i>

458
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,610
You're not going to rip it up?

459
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,860
It's worth two coins.

460
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,530
If you follow this path, you'll get to Fan Manor.

461
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,300
Let's separate here.

462
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,450
You want to leave?

463
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,670
I said it before. Once we get to the capital, I have my own things to do.

464
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,280
Thank you for taking me into the capital. We won't need to meet again.

465
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,710
You can come to find me if you have any problems. Perhaps I can help you!

466
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,580
You probably can't even save yourself.

467
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,290
If Liu Ruyu really wants to kill you,

468
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,260
you won't find it easy to enter Fan Manor's main entrance.

469
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,540
Please don't die. I won't get revenge for you if you do.

470
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,760
Thanks for your good wishes!

471
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,640
Let's see how you intend to kill me!

472
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,070
Once they pass the red flag, we will pounce on these two carriages. Understand?

473
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,740
Yes!

474
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,790
The soldiers have something else to do. I'll escort you back to Fan Manor.

475
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,370
Someone just told me that we'd reach Fan Manor if we go straight.

476
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,880
Why are we making a detour?

477
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,990
A horse carriage is overturned ahead. We have to go around it to return to Fan Manor.

478
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,860
What a coincidence.

479
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,520
Young Master, I have to use the restroom. Please wait a moment.

<i>[Temple of Qing]</i>

481
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,370
What sort of temple is this?

482
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,190
Leave!

483
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,050
<i>[Temple of Qing]</i>

484
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,430
You are young and tyrannical.

486
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,220
You don't know who I am?

487
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,560
Who cares? An important guest is inside the temple.

488
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,880
No one can step inside the temple.

489
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,650
So he wasn't waiting for me?

490
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,280
There is a message from the person inside.

491
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,530
People from Qing State can offer sacrifices at the temple. You can,

492
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:07,760
but you can only enter the side temple, not the main temple.

493
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,300
What if I don't go inside?

494
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,950
Then leave. What is there to say?

495
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,560
What is being worshiped inside?

496
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,050
Offering sacrifices to Heaven is the basis of this Temple of God.

497
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,250
How could you not know?

498
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,210
Temple of God?

499
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,920
When Heaven and Earth separated, beasts were running rampant.

500
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,290
The god from this temple came to Earth,

501
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,280
teaching humans written characters and moral values, helping them shape the mountain and the sea,

502
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,720
building up a foundation for mankind.

503
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,310
Haven't your masters taught you?

504
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,950
A legend?

505
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,010
You really don't know who I am?

528
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,860
♫ <i>Through the fire of war</i> ♫

529
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:43,850
♫ <i>You are always there for me</i> ♫

530
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,060
♫ <i>The flowers leave the boughs, quietly</i> ♫

531
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,780
♫ <i>Year in and year out, we are on the road counting the remaining days of the year</i> ♫

532
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,000
♫ <i>Even if we will never meet again</i> ♫

533
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,280
♫ <i>Even if the bond is broken</i> ♫

534
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,550
♫ <i>No complaints</i> ♫

535
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,960
♫ <i>It's a cold world and I think of you as I did before</i> ♫

536
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,300
♫ <i>The moon is sleepless</i> ♫

537
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,460
♫ <i>Leave a warm heart</i> ♫

538
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,140
♫ <i>To look after the rest of the year</i> ♫

539
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,610
♫ <i>Even if I have to cross a thousand mountains and through the fire of war</i> ♫

540
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,290
♫ <i>Even if I have to cross a thousand mountains and through the fire of war</i> ♫

541
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:25,160
♫ <i>You are always there for me</i> ♫
