1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 30

16
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,870
Only in this way

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,680
will you not get caught in trouble.

18
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,590
No! No!

19
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,270
I often criticize you,

20
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,400
but from the bottom of my heart,

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,680
I hope to see you

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,630
rise in the official world and get married.

23
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,440
I want to protect you all the way,

24
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,190
but I can't do it anymore.

25
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,680
Listen.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,440
I may not survive.

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,750
You have to be resolute

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,270
to keep yourself safe.

29
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,880
Got it?

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,080
Dad.

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,670
Dad!

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,910
I'm not your dad!

33
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,960
From now on,

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
I don't have a son

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
like you.

36
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,320
You're not my son anymore!

37
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,670
Dad.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,270
Let go of me.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,440
Let go of me.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,910
Dad.

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,000
Dad.

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,030
Dad!

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,520
Guo Youzhi has been put into prison.

44
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,390
What shall we do with you?

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,240
Your Majesty, I will

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
hand over Neiku to you.
(Neiku means Imperial Treasury)

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,520
That's what you should do!

48
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,110
As for other punishments,

49
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,880
you have the final say.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,720
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,320
As for betraying...

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,440
As I explained,

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,470
I met Zhuang Mohan

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,390
just to talk about literature.

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,190
It's ridiculous to say I betrayed Nanqing.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Who can give witness?

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,390
Who can give witness to

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,630
my collusion with Beiqi

59
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,960
and betrayal of Yan Bingyun?

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Few people know about

61
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,600
Yan Bingyun's lurking in Beiqi.

62
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,960
Shortly after you met Zhuang Mohan,

63
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,470
Yan Bingyun was arrested by Beiqi.

64
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,080
If it hadn't been you,

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,030
how could it have been leaked?

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,670
There is someone else

67
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,190
who knew about it.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,030
Who is it?

69
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,830
Fan Xian.

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,270
Yan Bingyun had left

71
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,720
when Fan Xian came to the capital city.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
How could he know that?

73
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,040
As far as I know,

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,350
Fan Xian met Yan Bingyun

75
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,600
on his way here.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,350
It's also possible

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,790
that he spilled the beans.

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,230
Is that true?

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll find it out.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,390
But even so,

81
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,000
it's impossible for Fan Xian to collude with Beiqi.

82
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,600
Why is it possible for me to do that?

83
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,880
Investigate!

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,480
Get to the bottom of it.

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,720
Got it.

86
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,720
Head Chen, you've been working hard

87
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,200
for the nation with great merits.

88
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,000
Let me see you out.

89
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

90
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,880
I've heard Fan Xian and you

91
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,390
are like old friends from the start.

92
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,790
Your Highness,

93
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,550
it's the same case for you and Fan Xian.

94
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,000
If Fan Xian is suspicious,

95
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,070
you'll handle it impartially, right?

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,230
That's for sure.

97
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,000
That'd be great.

98
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,550
Alright. Let's say goodbye here.

99
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,350
Head, take care.

100
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,510
Your Highness, take care.

101
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,510
Head, do you think

102
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,270
you've lifted a rock

103
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,000
only to drop it on your own toes?

104
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,110
My toes are numb.

105
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
Got me involved?

106
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,350
Yeah.

107
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Li Yunrui said

108
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,350
you met Yan Bingyun

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,920
on your way to the capital city.

110
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,600
Fan Xian?

111
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,350
Yan Bingyun?

112
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,440
We didn't see each other,

113
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,480
but we did meet.

114
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
In this case,

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,950
it'll be alright.

116
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,880
It doesn't matter as long as you didn't know

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,230
he was going to Beiqi.

118
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,000
A member of the Fourth Division

119
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,230
actually tried to kill his superior.

120
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,040
Yan Ruohai

121
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,950
must take the responsibility.

122
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,920
Teng Zijing is under the command of

123
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,760
his son Yan Bingyun.

124
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,040
The Head was so angry that

125
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,600
he dismissed him from his post,

126
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,950
asking him to

127
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,390
disguise himself with his men as trade caravan

128
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,070
to take over the intelligence network in Beiqi.

129
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,950
It's most confidential.

130
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,480
Master Fei shouldn't have told you about it.

131
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,640
He's got you into trouble.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You knew that

133
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,880
he was going to Beiqi

134
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,390
and he's arrested,

135
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,640
so you're suspicious.

136
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,830
It's no big deal.

137
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,320
No big deal?

138
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,670
Being suspicious is a big deal.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,440
Such being the case,

140
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
we can't declare Li Yunrui guilty.

141
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,350
We might have to give up

142
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,350
when it's nearly done.

143
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,070
What did Chen Pingping say?

144
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,640
He said

145
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,160
he needs to see you.

146
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,390
I'm afraid

147
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,640
there will be nothing he can do.

148
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,600
You can't go in.

149
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,320
You have to wait till I report it.

150
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,830
Let me go in.

151
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,320
No way.

152
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,390
I have something to say to His Excellency Fan.

153
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,670
-You can't go in. -Let me go in.

154
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,070
You have to wait till I report it.

155
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
I said you can't go in.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,640
Don't try to break in.

157
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,720
Let me in.

158
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,550
Let me in.

159
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,160
I have something to say to His Excellency Fan.

160
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
Let me in.

161
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,550
Young Master Guo.

162
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Why are you here?

163
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,000
You can leave.

164
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Fan Xian.

165
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,390
I did it wrong.

166
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,110
What?

167
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,880
Your Excellency, it's my fault.

168
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,070
You must've hit me

169
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,920
because I did something wrong.

170
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,760
I shouldn't have sued you.

171
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,270
I shouldn't have set myself against you.

172
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,100
What?

173
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you Guo Baokun?

174
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,320
Is he Guo Baokun?

175
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,110
Your Excellency,

176
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,640
let me kowtow and apologize to you.

177
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,670
Stand up.

178
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,830
Your Excellency.

179
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
No matter how hard you hit me or scold me,

180
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,000
I'd never complain.

181
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
I just beg you to let off my dad.

182
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,640
Everything is my fault.

183
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,470
Are you here for your dad's sake?

184
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,910
I shouldn't have said those words to you

185
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,400
at the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

186
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,400
It has nothing to do with my dad.

187
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,910
Please show mercy to him.

188
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,030
It's of no use to beg me for that.

189
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,550
Please show mercy to him.

190
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,640
Please show mercy to him.

191
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,670
Please show mercy to him.

192
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,550
Guo Baokun, listen to me.

193
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,960
Your dad colluded with the Princess Royal in private

194
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,000
to pursue selfish interests.

195
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,110
A courtier should never do something like that.

196
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,710
I...

197
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,470
Please help us! Please help us!

198
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,710
As I said, it's of no use to beg me.

199
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
Your Excellency, please!

200
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,840
Your Excellency.

201
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,030
I can do nothing about it.

202
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,880
Your Excellency, please!

203
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,710
I can do nothing about it.

204
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,280
Li Yunrui shifted the blame onto your dad

205
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,200
to protect herself.

206
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,400
In this case,

207
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,880
nobody could save your dad.

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
Your Excellency, there...

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,640
there must be something you can do.

210
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,280
Please save my dad.

211
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,230
Your Excellency, please.

212
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,710
Your Excellency, please!

213
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Your Excellency, please!

214
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,030
That's all I can say. Please go back.

215
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,110
Let's go.

216
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,280
Your Excellency.

217
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,640
Your Excellency.

218
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,960
Please save my dad.

219
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,520
Your Excellency.

220
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,840
Your Excellency.

221
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,110
Your Excellency.

222
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,030
Your Excellency.

223
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,470
Please save my dad, Your Excellency.

224
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,030
Your Excellency.

225
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,880
Your...

226
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,520
Fan Xian!

227
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,840
Someday,

228
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,280
I'll kill you with my own hands!

229
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,640
You're here.

230
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,200
Wang Qinian told me about that.

231
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,710
Li Yunrui planned to use me

232
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,960
as an excuse.

233
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,790
This time,

234
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,880
I was behind the scenes

235
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,280
and thought I wouldn't be noticed,

236
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,230
but unexpectedly,

237
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,710
I got involved anyway.

238
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,960
Freshly brewed tea.

239
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,590
I understand the current situation.

240
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,080
I heard

241
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,550
Li Yunrui and Zhuang Mohan talk about that,

242
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,440
but I don't have any hard evidence.

243
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,790
Now I'm also a suspect.

244
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm afraid it's impossible

245
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,280
to drive her away this time.

246
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,590
But thank you, anyway.

247
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,670
It's only partially successful.

248
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,200
Let's try to do it next time.

249
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,320
The Princess Royal lost.

250
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,000
I see, so I...

251
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,550
What did you say?

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,760
Do you know?

253
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,710
Even if you have hard evidence

254
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,470
and His Majesty knows

255
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,320
she colluded with Beiqi

256
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,710
and betrayed Yan Bingyun,

257
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,710
she wouldn't be driven out of the capital city.

258
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,590
Why not?

259
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,790
It's a betrayal of Nanqing.

260
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,470
She's the Princess Royal anyway.

261
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,910
They're not of the same blood, but she's
also a member of the royal family.

262
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,350
His Majesty would just scold her no matter
what a big mistake she made.

263
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,150
So, all my efforts

264
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,710
are in vain?

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,110
I promised

266
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,350
to help you drive her out of the capital city.

267
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,030
I'll never

268
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,880
break my promise.

269
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,350
Today, it was my aim

270
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,670
to let her say those words

271
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,320
in the presence of His Majesty.

272
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,230
As far as I know,

273
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,440
Fan Xian met Yan Bingyun

274
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,200
on his way here.

275
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,520
It's also possible

276
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,960
that he spilled the beans.

277
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,110
As she said that,

278
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,670
she made a big mistake.

279
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,110
She has lost

280
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,840
the battle.

281
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,640
She'll be driven out of the capital city.

282
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,520
She won't be punished because of her betrayal of Nanqing,

283
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,200
but she will because of those words.

284
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,550
Is there anything special about that?

285
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,550
She did something His Majesty can't bear.

286
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
Is it about me?

287
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,150
You met Yan Bingyun

288
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,550
on your way to the capital city,

289
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,230
which is top confidential.

290
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,640
Only the directors of the Investigator's Office

291
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
know about it.

292
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,790
How did she know?

293
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,080
There is only one possibility.

294
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,640
There is a hidden traitor in the Investigator's Office.

295
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,110
You know, the Investigator's Office

296
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,030
is directly under His Majesty.

297
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,840
Getting involved in our business

298
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,910
means a challenge to imperial power.

299
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,080
So,

300
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,400
His Majesty couldn't bear it.

301
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
What should we do?

302
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,400
Find him out and get rid of him.

303
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,200
This guy must be influential and powerful.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,840
Here I am. Who wants to see me?

305
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,760
Here I am! Who wants to see me?

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,790
Come out!

307
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,710
The leaflets were scattered everywhere,

308
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,280
but you haven't found out

309
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,280
who did it.

310
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,150
I'm ashamed to say the First Division

311
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,880
is responsible for supervising everything in the capital city.

312
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,960
Mobilize everyone you can

313
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,910
to find it out!

314
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,840
Yes, sir.

315
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,400
You can leave.

316
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,590
What's up?

317
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,030
Shadow came to me just now.

318
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
We almost fought.

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,670
Why?

320
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,910
Chen Pingping was attacked

321
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,790
the other day.

322
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,440
He's suspicious of me.

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,400
Is it you, Your Excellency?

324
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,470
Yan Ruohai, how dare you?

325
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,640
If you want to put me to death,

326
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,670
just report me.

327
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
Why do you want to kill the Head?

328
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,470
I don't want to see him

329
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,080
destroy the Investigator's Office.

330
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
Will you accept Fan Xian

331
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,000
as the Head of the Investigator's Office?

332
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,960
Why didn't Shadow fight with you?

333
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,840
He's not sure.

334
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,470
He tried to sound me out.

335
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,960
I pretended to know nothing about it and he let it go.

336
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,840
Why are you telling me about it?

337
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,960
I want to borrow a few guys from you.

338
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,470
You have your own subordinates.

339
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't trust them.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
What are you going to do?

341
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,400
To pick someone up out of town.

342
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,640
Who?

343
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,670
You just need to lend me

344
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,960
a few trustworthy guys.

345
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
Who are you going to pick up?

346
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,840
It's about Li Yunrui

347
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,880
betraying my son.

348
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,470
It's just a rumor,

349
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,550
Your Excellency.

350
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,470
Zhuang Mohan and his mission

351
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,000
have gone back to Beiqi

352
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,000
the other day.

353
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,000
Get to the point.

354
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,910
My men

355
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,670
caught someone from the mission

356
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,520
and are taking him back to the capital city secretly.

357
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,710
I'm going to pick him up.

358
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,520
Did they catch him on the way?

359
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,840
What do you want to do?

360
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,110
That guy can prove

361
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,520
Zhuang Mohan's relationship with Li Yunrui.

362
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,470
Li Yunrui betrayed my son.

363
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,670
I won't leave it at that.

364
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,550
Won't you

365
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,200
tell the Head about it?

366
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,080
Such being the case,

367
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,230
how could I trust him?

368
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,790
I'll look into it myself.

369
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,910
Zhu Ge,

370
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,920
the Fourth Division is not based in the capital city.

371
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,590
Nowadays, you're the only one

372
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,400
I can trust.

373
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,310
You can choose to help me or report me.

374
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,760
It's up to you.

375
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,520
You can have three men at most.

376
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,280
That'll be enough.

377
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,280
Hold on.

378
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,560
It's okay. You can leave.

379
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,590
Go to the village ahead

380
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,230
and get an ox cart

381
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,160
to take him back.

382
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,590
Zhu Ge?

383
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,430
We've been colleagues for years.

384
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,760
I didn't expect

385
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,920
we'd end up like this.

386
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,560
You can't kill me.

387
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,040
Why not?

388
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,110
Have you ever thought about it?

389
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,110
It might be a trap

390
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,310
set by Chen Pingping

391
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,280
to let you show your true colors.

392
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,950
I really have,

393
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,950
so I've sent

394
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,680
all my spies

395
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,920
to keep an eye on

396
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,880
all relevant parties in the capital city.

397
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,350
I can tell you

398
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,640
all master-hands

399
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,190
of the Investigator's Office in the capital city

400
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,640
haven't been mobilized up to now.

401
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
How about Shadow?

402
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,520
He still stays

403
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,920
outside the Head's room.

404
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,760
He's not moved a step from there.

405
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,400
Do you think your men can tail him?

406
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,190
No. They can't tail or stop him.

407
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,520
But

408
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,830
a message will be sent to me

409
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,400
once Shadow gets out of the Investigator's Office.

410
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,470
It'll be too late

411
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
even if he rushes here now.

412
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,350
Nobody has ever seen

413
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,110
the Shadow's face.

414
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,830
Haven't you thought

415
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,950
he had swapped

416
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,920
someone else over today?

417
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,230
Before I got out of town,

418
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,830
I talked to him on purpose

419
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,070
and confirmed he's Shadow himself.

420
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,230
You've been thoughtful.

421
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,560
So, it couldn't be a trap

422
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,190
set by the Head.

423
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,110
You're just buying time

424
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,830
and waiting for helpers.

425
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,110
My helpers may not be inside the capital city.

426
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,430
Do you mean black knights?

427
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,920
Black knights

428
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,110
have been hiding out of the city.

429
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,310
But what if I tell you

430
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,760
I also know

431
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,950
about the mobilization of them?

432
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,760
You've even got a spy among black knights?

433
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,040
You've been on guard against Chen Pingping?

434
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,000
Nobody

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,230
could save you today.

436
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,920
Do you have anything to say before you die?

437
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,190
Now that you're not

438
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,350
a trusted follower of Chen Pingping,

439
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,190
why do you want to kill me?

440
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,590
I caught that guy

441
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,310
just to find out the truth

442
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,160
about Li Yunrui's betrayal.

443
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,470
It has nothing to do with you.

444
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,400
Why do you...

445
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,880
You're protecting Li Yunrui.

446
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,110
You're her follower.

447
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,070
Have you ever seen Yan Ruohai?

448
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,640
Yes, several times.

449
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,000
I have little contact with him,

450
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,280
but I think

451
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,520
besides Chen Pingping,

452
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,830
among the eight directors,

453
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,520
he and Zhu Ge

454
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,640
are the best two.

455
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,160
What a pity!

456
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,520
Such a capable person

457
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,160
will die tonight.

458
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,040
I should've gone there.

459
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,920
No.

460
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,350
Zhu Ge did it after making full preparations.

461
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,400
He won't fail.

462
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,470
From today on,

463
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,760
the Investigator's Office will also work for me.

464
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,160
What do you think of the line

465
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
written by Fan Xian in his poem?

466
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,230
The jade and crystal mansions are so high!
(It's too high and too cold for me.)

467
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,760
Coldness doesn't bother me.

468
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,880
I just want to climb up and have a look.

469
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,710
From tomorrow on,

470
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,560
you'll be in charge of

471
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,710
both the Investigator's Office and Neiku.

472
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,590
You'll be the most powerful woman

473
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,830
in Nanqing.

474
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,560
I've heard a star will fall from the sky

475
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,280
when a talented person dies.

476
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,800
I can't wait to see the night screen hang down.

477
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,950
I'm looking forward to that.

478
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,040
Why?

479
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,470
Do you want to

480
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,470
take over the Investigator's Office

481
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,110
by soliciting Princess Royal's support?

482
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,400
I've never thought about that.

483
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,520
Do you have a grudge against Chen Pingping?

484
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
He's the one

485
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,350
I admire most.

486
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,400
It's not for power or for revenge.

487
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,190
So, why do you

488
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,310
work for Li Yunrui?

489
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,310
Of course it's for the sake of Nanqing.

490
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,950
I'd like to know more details.

491
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,880
As I said,

492
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,000
nobody could save you.

493
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
What's the point of

494
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,520
wasting time?

495
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,760
Ruohai,

496
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,680
I've been thinking you're imposing.

497
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,880
Don't ruin your image before death.

498
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,680
Kill him.

499
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,070
I'd be really dead

500
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,110
if you still refuse to show up.

501
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,040
Your Excellency,

502
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,560
you're unreasonable.

503
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,680
You said all master-hands

504
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,710
of the Investigator's Office

505
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,640
are kept under watch.

506
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,520
How about me?

507
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,110
Nobody kept me under watch.

508
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,400
Don't you take me seriously?

509
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,110
Zhu Ge looks down upon you.

510
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,280
You should've known that.

511
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,430
Head, why are you...

512
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,000
As I said, it's his trap.

513
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,160
It doesn't make a difference

514
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,430
even if the two of you are here.

515
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,520
Do you really think it's just the two of us?

516
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,520
I don't think you can get reinforcements

517
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,590
out of thin air.

518
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,880
Kill Yan Ruohai!

519
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,430
Black knights?

520
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,680
Impossible.

521
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,160
They've never been mobilized

522
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,000
since they took you back to the capital.

523
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,110
I've received messages every day

524
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,110
that no one has left.

525
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,830
Where did you get

526
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,830
these black knights?

527
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,310
You're really cautious.

528
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,430
Up to now,

529
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,400
I still can't confirm who's the spy

530
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,760
among black knights.

531
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000
He's not among the main force,

532
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,280
but among the Impedimentum Battalion
that's responsible for army provisions.

533
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,430
That explains why I failed to find anything wrong

534
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,800
while black knights are indeed kept under watch.

535
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,760
Head, can you tell me

536
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,310
where these black knights are from?

537
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,710
You're right.

538
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,920
Since I came back to the capital city,

539
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,400
black knights have never been mobilized.

540
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,710
Do you still remember

541
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,310
who was caught the last time they were mobilized

542
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,160
before I came back?

543
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,310
Take care!

544
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,560
Allow me to leave.

545
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,800
Me?

546
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,830
They helped me catch Si Lili.

547
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,590
Not only Si Lili.

548
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,280
All black knights who left that day are here.

549
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,520
We proclaimed that

550
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,880
they've gone to the northern border.

551
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,830
Actually,

552
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,950
they've been lurking

553
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,160
around the capital city

554
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,800
and waiting for you.

555
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,000
Have you started

556
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,590
to set a trap for me

557
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,640
since then?

558
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,070
No. Even earlier.

559
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,430
Before Fan Xian came to the capital city,

560
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,640
we'd started to get prepared.

561
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,230
Think about it.

562
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,280
When did I

563
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,920
begin to show

564
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,760
my grudge against the Head?

565
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,920
Last night,

566
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,190
in the residence of the Assistant
Minister of Ministry of Penalty,

567
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,950
someone from our Investigator's Office

568
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,280
was also there.

569
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,040
Yan Ruohai,

570
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,430
we don't have a say in this.

571
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,640
Whatever I do,

572
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,070
I do it for Nanqing.

573
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,350
So does the Head.

574
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,590
He's old.

575
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,880
Don't make me arrest you myself!

576
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,190
Do you suspect

577
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,310
it's the Head that betrayed him?

578
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,430
The only way to restart the war

579
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,430
is to assassinate Zhuang Mohan.

580
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,800
Zhuang Mohan is just a cover.

581
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,070
The person we're really going to kill

582
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,590
is Chen Pingping.

583
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,110
I don't want to see him

584
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,560
destroy the Investigator's Office.

585
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,070
Will you accept Fan Xian

586
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,280
as the Head of the Investigator's Office?

587
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,110
You've played the long game.

588
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,920
That's how we managed to let you believe

589
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,160
my grudge against Head.

590
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,430
By carrying out those assassinations,

591
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,230
you just rooted out

592
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,230
the Head's enemies.

593
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,350
We had scruples.

594
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
You couldn't have been taken in

595
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,470
if we hadn't played the long game.

596
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,640
You've long schemed to deal with me.

597
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,800
I deserve to lose.

598
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,110
The last question.

599
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,400
Head,

600
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,110
why did you

601
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,520
start to set a trap for me so early?

602
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,280
Because of the assassination in Danzhou.

603
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,950
I received a secret order from the
Investigator's Office to kill the traitor.

604
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
Do you work for the Investigator's Office?

605
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,950
The assassination happened

606
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,880
because the wrong order was given.

607
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,350
My son had to take responsibility

608
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,710
and was sent to Beiqi.

609
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,470
The forged order

610
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,310
must have something to do with the imperial harem.

611
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,110
But you have to understand

612
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,520
someone in the Investigator's Office must've served as a helper.

613
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,470
Why do you think it's me?

614
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,400
We've set traps for all directors.

615
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,680
Through screening,

616
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,040
we believe

617
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,760
you're the most likely suspect.

618
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,000
So, this guy

619
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,000
is not from the mission of Beiqi, right?

620
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,110
He's a condemned prisoner from the neighboring county.

621
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,920
He committed murder and arson,

622
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,830
so he deserved it.

623
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,190
Let me ask you again.

624
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,760
Why do you work for Li Yunrui?

625
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,000
What did she promise to give you?

626
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,310
Head,

627
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,800
I've been working in the Investigator's Office for years.

628
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,110
I was proud of my job.

629
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,710
But gradually,

630
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,310
I become frightened and worried.

631
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,310
The Investigator's Office is beyond
control of the Six Ministries.

632
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,040
It wins over the talented,

633
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,310
both self-discipled gentlemen

634
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,590
and people who know small tricks.

635
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,230
It can be said that most of the elites of Nanqing

636
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,470
are under the command of the Investigator's Office.

637
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,560
Supervising everything

638
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,760
is the duty of the Investigator's Office.

639
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,190
But what if it wants to rebel?

640
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,880
Who can stop it doing that?

641
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,400
Do you mean I want to rebel?

642
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,710
You may not do that,

643
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,110
but who can promise it won't happen in the future?

644
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,950
If the Investigator's Office

645
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,190
is in the control of someone with ambition,

646
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,040
and he keeps everything from His Majesty
and manipulates state affairs,

647
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,590
the consequences will be unimaginable.

648
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,070
Are you worried about trouble

649
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,110
that may not come?

650
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,710
Humans are capricious.

651
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,680
How can I sleep without anxiety?

652
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,190
How do you want to get it fixed?

653
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,520
If the Investigator's Office

654
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,560
is a huge beast,

655
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,280
then the leash used to control it

656
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,950
must be in the hands of the royal family.

657
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,310
Why is it the Princess Royal?

658
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,760
You can choose

659
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,800
the Crown Prince.

660
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,830
Disturbances will arise if an emperor's son is in power.

661
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,040
It's a different case for the Princess Royal.

662
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,000
She's a member of the royal family,
but not the emperor's next of kin.

663
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,950
And she's a woman.

664
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,000
She may die anytime

665
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,520
if His Majesty wants.

666
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,760
That's why a prolonged political stability will be achieved

667
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,040
if she takes over the Investigator's Office.

668
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,800
Head.

669
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,000
You really did it for the sake of Nanqing.

670
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,350
That's for sure!

671
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,310
It sounds nicer than it is.

672
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,430
You know nothing about it.

673
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,590
If it were for the sake of Nanqing,

674
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,760
why did she betray our secret agents

675
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
to Beiqi?

676
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,190
I really don't understand.

677
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,950
I knew nothing about that.

678
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,190
And I didn't expect

679
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,230
she'd do that.

680
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,280
In this case, why do you still work for her?

681
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,590
As I said,

682
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,470
I hope the Investigator's Office

683
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,190
is in the control of the royal family

684
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,230
to make sure

685
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,040
social and political stability in Nanqing.

686
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,000
As for Li Yunrui's moral quality

687
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,920
and whether she's kind or evil,

688
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,280
it doesn't matter.

689
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,000
There would be room for negotiation

690
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,280
if it were for power or for wealth.

691
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,000
Now that we have different ideas about righteousness,

692
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,830
we've reached the point of no return.

693
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,230
Of course.

694
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,590
Turn him over to His Majesty.

695
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,520
No way!

696
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,000
A cornered beast will still fight, right?

697
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,590
If you take me

698
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,710
to His Majesty,

699
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,680
Li Yunrui is bound to

700
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,640
be driven out of the capital city.

701
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,230
Then my efforts in the past years

702
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,430
will come to nothing.

703
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,710
But if I die today,

704
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,920
nobody could prove Li Yunrui once got involved

705
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,560
in the affairs of the Investigator's Office.

706
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,760
Is Hong Sixiang not in the imperial palace?

707
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,400
No.

708
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,070
Are you sure?

709
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,520
Since you're suspicious of

710
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,470
the Empress Dowager,

711
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,950
I've been staying alert.

712
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,280
As soon as I found Hong Sixiang getting
out of the palace in secret,

713
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,800
I'm here to tell you about it.

714
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,350
Where could the old eunuch go?

715
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,070
Oh no.

716
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,400
Chen Pingping is good at setting a trap.

717
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,880
Eunuch Hong, you're also here.

718
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,560
Such a serious matter

719
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,470
needs someone as a witness.

720
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,680
If you don't want His Majesty

721
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,190
to know about it,

722
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,680
you can kill me

723
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,760
before you commit suicide.

724
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,710
Eunuch Hong, you must be kidding.

725
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,590
Your Excellency,

726
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,350
it's your fault.

727
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,680
It's okay

728
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,710
that you don't consider me a master-hand,

729
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,800
but why haven't you sent someone

730
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,830
to keep watch on Eunuch Hong?

731
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,760
What I want to guard against is the Investigator's Office,

732
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,590
but not the imperial palace.

733
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,520
Your Excellency, let's go back.

734
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,190
Your Excellency, are you going to run away

735
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,680
or kill me

736
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,430
or commit suicide?

737
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,310
It's up to you.

738
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,920
Let's just see if you can do it.

739
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,280
Head.

740
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,680
Did you hear

741
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,800
what Zhu Ge said?

742
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,520
Yeah.

743
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,710
In this case,

744
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,870
it doesn't matter if he's dead.

745
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,430
Head Chen, what do you want to say?

746
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,120
I know Zhu Ge well.

747
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
If we take him back to the capital city,

748
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,760
those interrogations

749
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,760
are no different from humiliation.

750
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,000
He's at the end of his rope.

751
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,670
What he wants is just to save face.

752
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,870
Eunuch Hong,

753
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,280
we couldn't bear to be insulted

754
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,430
if it were us, right?

755
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,120
Give it back to him.

756
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,910
Thank you, Head.

757
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,800
Head,

758
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,190
Fan Xian is intelligent and witty.

759
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,800
He's also a great writer.

760
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,670
Among the younger generation,

761
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,280
he's second to none.

762
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,280
Maybe he'll become

763
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,560
a grand master in the literary world

764
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,120
or a famous official that does good to society.

765
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,760
But he's not suitable for taking over the Investigator's Office.

766
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,950
Since he arrived in the capital city,

767
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,950
I've been keeping an eye on him.

768
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,560
He's a genius,

769
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,080
but he doesn't have reverence

770
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,430
for the royal family in his heart.

771
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,710
If he takes over the Investigator's Office,

772
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,230
I'm afraid radical changes would happen.

773
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,280
Do you need me to tell His Majesty

774
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,430
about what you just said?

775
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,190
It's the last time I'm offering a piece of advice.

776
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,120
I've devoted my life to serving Nanqing,

777
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,080
without any selfish motives.

778
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,000
It's a pity that I'm going to die,

779
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,280
but I never regret anything I've done.

780
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,080
Guys,

781
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,470
I'm leaving for that faraway place.

782
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
Head Chen,

783
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm going back to the imperial palace.

784
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,320
I'll report

785
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,280
what I heard here to His Majesty.

786
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,190
Thank you, Eunuch Hong.

787
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,520
I still remember

788
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,910
how high-spirited you were

789
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,320
when you stepped into the courtyard

790
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,230
the first time I saw you.

791
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,630
I also remember.

792
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,120
Please take him back.

793
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,800
That faraway place.

794
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,910
We'll see each other again someday.

795
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,520
Let's go back.

796
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,000
I didn't plan to make him die.

797
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,120
If you choose a path in life

798
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,560
and walk along it till the end

799
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,190
without giving in,

800
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,870
you can count yourself lucky.

801
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,390
Your Highness, Hong Sixiang getting out of the imperial palace

802
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,430
may not have anything to do with Zhu Ge's issue.

803
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,870
What Director Yan said makes sense.

804
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,760
Your Highness, please don't worry.

805
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,840
Did you see that?

806
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,430
See what?

807
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,950
A shooting star fell and disappeared in a flash.

808
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,840
It's beautiful.

809
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,280
Is that all?

810
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,710
Yes.

811
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,670
I've told you everything that happened today

812
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
without any omission.

813
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,360
As for what Zhu Ge said about Fan Xian,

814
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,470
what's your opinion?

815
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,670
It's a serious matter. I don't dare to say anything about it.

816
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,670
Each of them

817
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,120
has their own plan,

818
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,190
but they all said

819
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,430
they're loyal to Nanqing.

820
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,560
They've never thought

821
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,280
what I want them to do.

822
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,840
What you said has profound meaning.

823
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,670
I really don't understand.

824
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,470
Those who pretend not to understand actually get the point.

825
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,120
Let Li Yunrui come here.

826
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,000
Your Majesty,

827
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,470
Her Highness is kneeling outside.

828
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,150
Is Her Highness still kneeling?

829
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,670
Yes.

830
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,520
Nothing has happened in the Imperial Study.

831
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,600
You'll get Her Highness into bigger trouble if you go there!

832
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,280
Do you want to watch it happen without doing anything?

833
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,870
If we can do nothing about it,

834
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,710
maybe someone else can.

835
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,950
At this moment,

836
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,670
nobody would stand out to offend His Majesty.

837
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,840
Your Highness.

838
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,840
You can't go, Your Highness.

839
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,320
Do you want to see me?

840
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,320
What's up?

841
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,950
What is Lin Wan'er

842
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,320
to you?

843
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,520
A wife-to-be.

844
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,040
Do you want to marry her

845
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,600
for Neiku

846
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,190
or for herself?

847
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,430
Even if she's a maidservant

848
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,630
or a slave girl,

849
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,040
I'll marry nobody but her.

850
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,820
In the river of history,

851
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,020
time goes round and round.

852
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,380
Memories about the former and present lives

853
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,260
join each other in an endless way.

854
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,860
In the long drunken Milky Way,

855
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,580
one season follows another in a flash,

856
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,780
and the wild geese are flying south.

857
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,700
I just can't give up

858
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,700
to be with you for my whole life.

859
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:32,980
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

860
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,780
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

861
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,660
Year after year in the wandering,

862
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,220
I count the remaining years.

863
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,420
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

864
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,980
even though we have ended up the destiny,

865
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,660
I never feel regretful.

866
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,620
In such a chaotic world,

867
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,380
I still miss you as ever.

868
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,020
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

869
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,740
With a gentle heart,

870
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,300
I cherish our remaining years.

871
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,140
Even though we have to go through

872
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,100
all the hardships along the journey,

873
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:12,420
you always stay by my side,

874
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,180
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

875
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,100
Year after year in the wandering,

876
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,460
I count the remaining years.

877
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,820
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

878
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,620
even though we end up the destiny,

879
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,060
I never feel regretful.

880
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,980
In such a chaotic world,

881
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,940
I still miss you as ever.

882
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,620
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

883
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,380
With a gentle heart,

884
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,780
I cherish our remaining years.

885
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,580
Even though we have to go through

886
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,740
all the hardships along the journey,

887
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:53,020
you always stay by my side...
