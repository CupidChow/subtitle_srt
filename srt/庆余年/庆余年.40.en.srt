1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 40

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,120
Actually, it's easy to guess.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,720
What he wants

18
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,870
is just Xiao En.

19
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,950
But Fan Xian doesn't know

20
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,550
where Xiao En is imprisoned.

21
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,080
Do you know why

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I detained Xiao En?

23
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,230
No. I don't.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,800
Just for this moment.

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,590
Go to

26
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,550
get He Daoren and Langtao here.

27
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,680
Got it.

28
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,320
Thank you, Grand General!

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,190
It's such a pleasure to ride a horse

30
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,030
and chat with you.

31
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,190
See you!

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,830
Spread the word.

33
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,600
Do as planned

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
by Fan Xian.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
Do it tomorrow!

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,110
Fan Xian is not necessarily helping us with sincerity.

37
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,910
He wants to take advantage of me

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,550
to kill Shen Zhong!

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Your Excellency see it through?

40
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,720
Not quite!

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,270
I must kill

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,800
Shen Zhong anyway!

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,520
Yeah!

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,750
According to the plan,

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,520
after getting adoptive father out,

46
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,440
Fan Xian is bound to coordinate in person.

47
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,240
After getting out the Old Master,

48
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,000
we can only run to Nanqing.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
When it comes, just take my order

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,720
to kill Fan Xian.

51
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,720
Then how will we go to Nanqing?

52
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,600
Who said we have to go to Nanqing?

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,110
After killing Fan Xian,

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,960
we should run to the border quickly

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
and gather the army.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
To revolt?

57
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,470
Fan Xian's misjudgment

58
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
is that he thinks

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
running towards Nanqing

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,030
is our only way to survive.

61
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,190
Everything is ready now! We'll start tomorrow.

62
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,390
I've met Shangshan Hu.

63
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,630
Considering Shen Zhong's intelligence,

64
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,030
he must know someone will rescue Xiao En.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,360
You want to create the deadlock

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,550
like the tug of war?

67
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,630
Either of them has to die anyway.

68
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,360
Which one of them?

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,910
It makes no difference.

70
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,240
It's good to Nanqing

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,830
for either of them to die.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,830
Shen Zhong can't be killed.

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,390
What?!

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,030
Shen Zhong can't be killed.

75
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,320
Why?

76
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,750
He Daoren lets you

77
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,360
take over the Neiku's shop at Shangjing,

78
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,030
right?

79
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,750
Yes!

80
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,160
The account book has problems.

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,720
What are the problems?

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,950
All the account books handed in by Shangjing

83
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,440
to the capital city will be reviewed

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,390
by the Investigator's Office over the years.

85
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,510
It is very different from what is recorded here.

86
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,390
So?

87
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,830
So all the account books

88
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,350
received by the Investigator's Office are fake.

89
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,000
Judging from these,

90
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,600
someone in the middle

91
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,160
has held back

92
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,230
a big amount of money.

93
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,550
Trafficking!

94
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,760
That looks like the Princess Royal's idea.

95
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,350
The worse thing is that this sum of money

96
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,200
was delivered to Nanqing territory

97
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,790
by Shen Zhong's Embroidered Uniform Guards.

98
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,270
Why would Shen Zhong help

99
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,440
Li Yunrui with her illegal dealing?

100
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,230
To make money from it?

101
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,880
Shen Zhong is not greedy for money.

102
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,640
There is only one possibility

103
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,440
for him to agree with it.

104
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,160
This sum of money

105
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,070
will eventually lead to the civil strife of our dynasty.

106
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,440
How much is it?

107
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,830
It's enough to raise a camp of private army

108
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,200
after so many years of accumulation.

109
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,200
Armors, weapons, provisions,

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,230
and horses

111
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,950
are all the best type.

112
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,040
They are enough to revolt

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,550
at critical times.

114
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm afraid Princes Royal

115
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,640
is not the only one involved.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,510
Princess Royal has been with the Crown Prince all the time.

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,390
Is it a scheme from the Eastern Palace?

118
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
We have to ask Shen Zhong

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,350
for the truth.

120
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,230
Who?

121
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,230
Shen Zhong!

122
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
He won't tell us.

123
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,160
Then think of a way.

124
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Or you may marry

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,040
his younger sister

126
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,510
and become his family member.

127
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,230
He will tell you

128
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,070
whatever you ask.

129
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,600
Fan Xian, this is critically important

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
and allows no jokes.

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,270
So you are aware this is a joke!

132
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,880
Mr. Yan,

133
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,510
do you know what you're talking about?

134
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,760
Do you know

135
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,600
how much efforts I made

136
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,640
to work between different powers in Beiqi

137
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,230
before I finally get tomorrow's chance

138
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,880
to kill Shen Zhong?

139
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,440
And you just said

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,920
Shen Zhong can't be killed.

141
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,760
And you want me

142
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,350
to ask something confidential from him.

143
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,350
Who do you think I am?!

144
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,390
Do you think I'm god?

145
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,920
Try to catch him alive and extract his confession by torturing.

146
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,640
This is Shangjing.

147
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,350
You want me to

148
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,440
catch Shen Zhong alive here and extract
his confession by torturing!

149
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
Yan Bingyun,

150
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,830
I'm not ready to die yet.

151
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,070
Head asked He Daoren to give you hints.

152
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,830
He probably found something suspicious.

153
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,510
That's the mission

154
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,720
given to you and me by Head.

155
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,480
Fine!

156
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,440
Then ask Chen Pingping

157
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,670
to come and investigate in person.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Fan Xian, mind your identity!

159
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,830
What's my identity?

160
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

161
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,920
So what?

162
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,790
Since you and I have joined the Investigator's Office,

163
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,880
we should follow the Head's command

164
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,110
to fight for Nanqing

165
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
regardless of life and death.

166
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
What if

167
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,110
I want to stay alive?

168
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,760
I was right.

169
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,720
People like you

170
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,920
don't deserve to be the Director-General
of the Investigator's Office.

171
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
It's a deal.

172
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,550
We rescue Xiao En tomorrow

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,160
and take the chance to kill Shen Zhong.

174
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,230
This is an

175
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,110
unstoppable plan!

176
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,510
You're still not physically recovered.

177
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,000
It's better for you to stay indoors.

178
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,790
Watch out!

179
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,880
Don't damage the yard.

180
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,550
Yes!

181
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,070
Your Excellency!

182
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,270
Watch Yan Bingyun for me!

183
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,830
I need to know all his actions.

184
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,550
Your Excellency!

185
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,080
Sure!

186
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,470
According to what Fan Xian said, this is the place.

187
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,520
Go to the top of the mountain

188
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,230
and act according to the plan.

189
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes!

190
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,280
Commander,

191
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,670
some people broke in the yard.

192
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,320
Set out!

193
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,400
Split up and sneak in!

194
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,590
Find adoptive father as soon as possible!

195
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,350
Yes!

196
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,880
Your Excellency, I am Tan Wu!

197
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,790
I'm here to get you out as requested by the Grand General!

198
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
Your Excellency, I found him.

199
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,110
I got him!

200
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,110
Let's rush out!

201
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,520
It's a trap!

202
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,470
Let's escape from the back yard!

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,110
Go back! Go!

204
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,790
We're besieged.

205
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,320
It is planned in advance.

206
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,150
Is it a trap set up

207
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,960
by Shen Zhong and Fan Xian?

208
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,000
That doesn't matter anymore.

209
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,550
Brothers,

210
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,640
let's fight to death together.

211
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,520
Grand General,

212
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,000
you're of the Ninth Dan.

213
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,550
There is still chance

214
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,470
to survive

215
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,350
if you fight alone.

216
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,440
Running away on my own is not something I will do.

217
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,350
If you don't go,

218
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,000
who will avenge us?

219
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,550
Grand General!

220
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,320
Stop it!

221
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,590
Please avenge us!

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,200
Please avenge us!

223
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,910
Commander!

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,790
How is it?

225
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,230
We have besieged them.

226
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,710
Let's take a look!

227
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,790
Yes!

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,840
Stop!

229
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Shen Zhong!

230
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,110
Where is Shangshan Hu?

231
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,670
Commander,

232
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,640
they are all the ones left

233
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,550
when we besieged them.

234
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,030
It's not easy to catch a martial arts master of Ninth Dan

235
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,670
if he wants to escape.

236
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,840
Tan...

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,960
Tan Wu!

238
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,640
I have met you before!

239
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,320
I keep Xiao En

240
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,000
as a bait to attract Shangshan Hu.

241
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,550
I'm already too eager to wait any longer.

242
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,400
Shangshan Hu? What does this have to do with him?

243
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,470
You still want to protect him?

244
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,080
We started this simultaneously.

245
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,110
It has nothing to do with others.

246
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,400
It's doesn't matter whether you admit it or not.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,640
You are Shangshan Hu's personal guard.

248
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,080
Catching you is enough to convict him.

249
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,790
The border army has gone through many battles.

250
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,960
No one ever allows himself to be
seized without putting up a fight.

251
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,110
I know you want to fight to death.

252
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,840
I don't care!

253
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,440
Your corpse is equally enough

254
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,200
to convict Shangshan Hu.

255
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,960
What will be the charges?

256
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
You will be the charges.

257
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,790
How do you convict him

258
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,910
with a bunch of faceless corpses?

259
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,590
You want to burn up the traces?

260
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Your gravestone will not even

261
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,760
have any names.

262
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,470
We've been arrogant and rebellious while living.

263
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,000
It's fair enough to die into lonely ghosts.

264
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,590
His Excellency Xiao is unimaginably outstanding

265
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,550
and shall not be humiliated with another kidnapping.

266
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,030
Let him go with us together today!

267
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,760
Do it! Do it now!

268
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,080
Protect His Excellency!

269
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,960
Fan Xian set me up and Shen Zhong killed me!

270
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,440
Fan Xian set me up and Shen Zhong killed me!

271
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,200
Hurry up!

272
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,350
Fetch more water!

273
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,960
They deserve to be the border army of Beiqi!

274
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,960
What a pity!

275
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,640
They are all charred. Absolutely no chance of surviving!

276
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,110
This is Xiao En judging from the body shape.

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,800
How about the leg injury?

278
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,070
The leg injury matches as well.

279
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,160
Is it a new injury?

280
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,110
Yes!

281
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,350
It's an injury caused recently.

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,760
How about teeth?

283
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,800
Three teeth missing. The position is correct.

284
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,560
So this is Xiao En without a doubt.

285
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,950
Your Excellency,

286
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,470
I think it's a bit strange

287
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,230
that Xiao En just died like that.

288
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,950
It's sort of...

289
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
I think he is Xiao En.

290
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,070
Yeah, he surely is!

291
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,710
I'm just curious about

292
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,950
where Fan Xian is right now.

293
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,000
There it comes!

294
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,760
The last load?

295
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,640
Yeah, the last load.

296
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,710
31, 32,

297
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,070
33,

298
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,950
34,

299
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,350
35,

300
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,920
36,

301
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,400
36, 37,

302
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,520
38,

303
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,000
39.

304
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,560
Eh...

305
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,160
How come there is an extra one?

306
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,040
They are warriors.

307
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,710
Bury them together.

308
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,710
Sure!

309
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,070
Let's get back to town and visit the Grand General.

310
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,350
It's all blocked in the direction to town

311
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,430
especially in the direction to the Grand General's residence.

312
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
Commander-in-Chief of Embroidered Uniform Guard

313
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
Shen Zhong pays respects

314
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,070
to the Grand General!

315
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,560
Greetings to you, Grand General!

316
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,920
I have something to report

317
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,430
and have to bother you with it.

318
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,310
Today, we got some rebels that tried to break in the prison

319
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,040
and take Xiao En away.

320
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,040
Fortunately, they didn't run away.

321
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,280
We caught them.

322
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,230
What are these people like?

323
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,950
We don't know!

324
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,350
Those rebels burnt themselves.

325
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,710
It's hard to tell their identity.

326
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,880
Why do you

327
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,520
report something like this to me?

328
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,800
Because Xiao En

329
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,110
was also burnt to death.

330
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,800
He is, after all, your adoptive father.

331
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,560
It's necessary to report it to you.

332
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,560
Alright!

333
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,280
These rebels from today charged

334
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,190
with spears like this as well.

335
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,880
What do they look like?

336
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,760
We can't tell as they have their face masked.

337
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,560
Do you know anyone else

338
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,310
who uses this type of spear, Grand General?

339
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,520
I don't know.

340
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,280
Grand General,

341
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,830
you spear seems to have the smell of blood.

342
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,110
So what?

343
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,950
It's just off the top of my head.

344
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,280
Good spear!

345
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,560
By the way,

346
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,680
I've got one more thing to report.

347
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,310
Empress Dowager

348
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,280
has been hesitant about

349
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,560
whether to use Xiao En or not

350
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,830
in future.

351
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,920
You know it very well that

352
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,920
I've been cruel to Xiao En.

353
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,000
If he is really used,

354
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,110
what shall I do in future?

355
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,830
What do you think?

356
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,310
You do feel afraid?

357
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,920
I'm timid as always

358
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,920
and naturally feel afraid.

359
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,880
I've considered killing Xiao En,

360
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,110
but if I kill him,

361
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,760
the Empress Dowager won't spare me.

362
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,950
Those rebels tried to break into the prison

363
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,310
only to have him killed,

364
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,350
which helps me eliminate the hidden danger.

365
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,310
I should congratulate you on this then,

366
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Your Excellency!

367
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,950
Grand General, do you know

368
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,520
I invited Langtao and He Daoren

369
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,920
to watch in private?

370
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,110
If there is really someone

371
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,350
planning for secret rescue,

372
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,640
the intervention of two martial arts masters of Ninth Dan

373
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,160
can truly eliminate the hidden danger.

374
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,640
If someone escapes in the chaos,

375
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,880
is it possible that

376
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
he runs to your residence?

377
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,880
If no one comes till now,

378
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,590
I think he should probably

379
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,280
be dead already.

380
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,280
This is really a good spear.

381
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,800
If nobody saves him,

382
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,040
there is really no reason for me to kill him.

383
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,680
Grand General,

384
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,400
who do you think

385
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,760
victimized Xiao En?

386
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,920
I probably should leave for now.

387
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,640
Excuse me!

388
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,520
Shangshan Hu is invincible.

389
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,000
His prestige in the army is increasing each day.

390
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,430
If we leave him like that,

391
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,190
he will become a great threat to Beiqi.

392
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,160
If he attempted to kill me today,

393
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,920
we can surely convict him with it.

394
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,560
What a pity!

395
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,710
If he really attempted to, Your Excellency...

396
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,430
As Embroidered Uniform Guards,

397
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,800
we take charge of the prison and punishment.

398
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,950
We usually arrest thieves, bandits and malefactors secretly

399
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,680
and often interrogate them

400
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,280
in the most merciless and ruthless way.

401
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,760
All that is to ensure safety of Beiqi.

402
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,560
If my death today

403
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,160
can be traded for the imprisonment of this rebel,

404
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,280
it's nothing to be afraid of.

405
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,000
What a pity!

406
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,830
What a pity!

407
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,230
He Daoren.

408
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,000
Shen Zhong is adept in scheming.

409
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,640
What are you waiting for?

410
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,800
He is old anyway.

411
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,590
Time kills most, doesn't it?

412
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,950
Shen Zhong sent you here?

413
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,230
Yes!

414
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,040
Tell Shen Zhong you lost him

415
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,800
and give him to me.

416
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,470
No!

417
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,430
Or tell Shen Zhong

418
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,590
he slipped off the precipice.

419
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,760
Don't worry!

420
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,190
I won't allow him to show up again.

421
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm not the only one who come to kill him.

422
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,680
Langtao is there!

423
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,400
Shen Zhong really thinks too much of me.

424
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,040
How about Ku He? Why hasn't he come?

425
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,620
=Langtao, first apprentice of Great Master Ku He=

426
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,160
My master enjoined me

427
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,230
not to let you live.

428
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,160
I can't disobey it.

429
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,760
Please excuse me for that.

430
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,400
As Ku He's apprentice,

431
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,350
you're just like him.

432
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,760
Seemingly righteous and merciful,

433
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,280
but actually crafty and wicked

434
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,190
in private.

435
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,800
Kill me as you wish!

436
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,070
Don't make it seem so aggrieved.

437
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,070
I must save him.

438
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,710
I can't help you.

439
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,190
Shen Zhong has started to doubt me.

440
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,310
You don't need to do it publicly.

441
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,400
Just stop him with a few moves in the dark.

442
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,880
It's an abyss over there.

443
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,920
You can't escape.

444
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,160
That's not your business.

445
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,760
Watch out!

446
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,470
Your Majesty!

447
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,110
Your Majesty!

448
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,040
Your Majesty!

449
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,040
I'm fine! I'm OK!

450
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,070
I just had a bad dream.

451
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,190
I was worried and rushed in abruptly.

452
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,760
I'm willing to take penalty.

453
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,310
Any news from our mission to Beiqi?

454
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,230
Your Majesty,

455
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
the Beiqi capital city

456
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,520
is too far away from here.

457
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,640
It takes a long time

458
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,040
to deliver messages.

459
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,710
We haven't got any till now.

460
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,310
Your Majesty,

461
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,070
you've been away from the palace

462
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,830
for a few days.

463
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,160
Empress Dowager is a bit worried.

464
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,560
OK!

465
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,710
Leave me! Leave me!

466
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,430
Yes!

467
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,470
There is no trace. I'm afraid they are dead.

468
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,920
Who is the guy bumping in?

469
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,430
I don't know.

470
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,590
We must find their corpses if dead.

471
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,350
Search down there!

472
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,870
We just sorted out the battlefield report

473
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,870
for Fan Xian's battle at the border.

474
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,390
The news has been intermittent

475
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,560
ever since they reached Beiqi

476
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,950
and stopped altogether

477
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,360
after they reached Shangjing.

478
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,150
Yan Bingyun was captured.

479
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,120
The agent network lurks in Shangjing.

480
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,470
That's something beyond our control.

481
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
Fei Jie is investigating Fan Xian's affair.

482
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,190
Don't let him see this report.

483
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,760
Don't worry. This is the only copy.

484
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,390
Fan Xian's whereabouts is unknown at the moment.

485
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't you have any other agent

486
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,080
in Shangjing?

487
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,560
If I had,

488
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,430
Yan Bingyun wouldn't have been captured.

489
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,120
Go there and check it out.

490
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,040
Yes!

491
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,360
You guys go to the woods.

492
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,950
Yes! Yes!

493
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,800
Report, no one on this side.

494
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,800
How is Xiao En's injury?

495
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,520
The cut on his chest leaves him no chance of surviving.

496
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,150
He can't be saved.

497
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,000
Whoever wants to save him,

498
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,670
it will end up in vain.

499
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,840
Wait for a few more minutes!

500
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,280
If we can find the corpse,

501
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,040
it will be an explanation

502
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
to Commander Shen.

503
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,230
Report, no findings.

504
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,000
Search harder!

505
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,870
Yes!

506
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,150
Any news from Fan Xian?

507
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,120
Nothing abnormal after they reached Shangjing.

508
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,710
Is there any battlefield report?

509
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,670
No!

510
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,430
Shadow!

511
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,120
Why?

512
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,280
Because you've been holding

513
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,870
something back from me.

514
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,950
Nobody ever sees

515
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,520
what Shadow looks like

516
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,470
over the years.

517
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,470
It is you!

518
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,390
What's wrong with Shadow?

519
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,280
He fell asleep.

520
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
Did you see his face?

521
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,560
I did.

522
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,870
Don't disclose his identity!

523
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,870
Fan Xian encountered

524
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,560
Haitang Duoduo,

525
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,760
Yan Xiaoyi and Shangshan Hu in the battle at the border.

526
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,280
His life is in grave danger.

527
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,120
Where are you black knights?

528
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,390
I withdrew the black knights from the mission.

529
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,390
You know well that

530
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,120
the journey is full of danger.

531
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,320
You're killing him.

532
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,280
He is still alive.

533
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,520
Chen Pingping!

534
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,430
I won't allow you

535
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,320
to let Fan Xian be your puppet.

536
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,600
He is the only and last apprentice

537
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,800
I have.

538
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,430
I'll ensure his safety

539
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,670
even if it means to work against you.

540
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,120
I've hidden the report

541
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,670
about Fan Xian very well.

542
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
Your technique of applying poison is indeed unparallel,

543
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,080
but perceiving chances

544
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,630
is not something you're good at.

545
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,040
There must be someone helping you.

546
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,150
He is right here, isn't he?

547
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,000
He's got it right.

548
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,630
Come out for a meeting then!

549
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,470
I knew it is you!

550
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,760
It's not detected

551
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,280
in the yard till now.

552
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,360
Only you are able to do so.

553
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,870
You said

554
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,120
it was meant to help Fan Xian

555
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,600
to gain success and fame for him to go to Beiqi.

556
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,360
I did say that.

557
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,800
You also promised

558
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,080
to ensure his safety.

559
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,360
I did!

560
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
But you withdrew the black knights

561
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,840
protecting the mission anyhow

562
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,120
and allowed him to take the risk alone.

563
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,560
You want to victimize him.

564
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,320
He is alive!

565
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,710
You leave him

566
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,470
facing several Ninth Dan martial arts masters alone.

567
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,430
Allow him to continue!

568
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,430
What I did

569
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,560
is meant to figure out

570
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,710
the secret of Xiao En.

571
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,150
What does it have to do with Fan Xian?

572
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,840
He didn't disclose it in all those years,

573
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,710
surely not to Fan Xian either.

574
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,600
I think he will.

575
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,000
Why?

576
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,040
I can tell you the reason behind,

577
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,840
but he can't listen to it.

578
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,800
Do you think

579
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,870
I dare not take action against you?

580
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,760
We're going to meet him.

581
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,600
Whom?

582
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,080
Whose arrangement was it

583
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,950
to withdraw the black knights?

584
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Trust me!

585
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,040
I'll go with him

586
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,390
for this matter.

587
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,560
You can't go!

588
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Wait! What if

589
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,080
I do?

590
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,600
I know you don't fear death,

591
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
but you can help Fan Xian

592
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,800
as long as you stay alive.

593
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,360
I promise you

594
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,840
if Fan Xian really dies,

595
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,040
I'll avenge him with you in the capital city.

596
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,800
Whoever wants to kill Fan Xian,

597
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,360
I'll bury the whole world with him

598
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,040
if he dies.

599
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,630
If it were only He Daoren

600
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,430
and Langtao

601
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,950
in those years,

602
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,230
there is no chance for me to lose.

603
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,230
If an old man keeps talking about his past years,

604
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,670
he is dying soon.

605
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,430
I am dying already.

606
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,710
The antidote is a waste on me.

607
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,630
Let me stop the bleeding first.

608
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,430
It's useless. I know.

609
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,320
Langtao's cut has broken my heart vessel.

610
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,560
What are you laughing at?

611
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,870
I'm laughing at you, Fan Xian.

612
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,150
What is there to laugh about me?

613
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,760
Nothing,

614
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,630
but you saved me.

615
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,080
I'm happy.

616
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,710
You start to talk nonsense.

617
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,470
So withdrawing black knights

618
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,430
and putting Fan Xian in danger

619
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,760
are the ideas from Your Majesty?

620
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,190
If Your Majesty wants to kill Fan Xian,

621
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,470
just issue an edict.

622
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,230
What's the need to take such big movements

623
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,670
and send him to Beiqi?!

624
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,870
After all,

625
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,950
he is nothing but an official

626
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,470
whose life and death are in the hands of Your Majesty.

627
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,540
In the river of history,

628
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,740
time goes round and round.

629
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Memories about the former and present lives

630
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,980
join each other in an endless way.

631
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,580
In the long drunken Milky Way,

632
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,300
one season follows another in a flash,

633
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,500
and the wild geese are flying south.

634
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,420
I just can't give up

635
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,420
to be with you for my whole life.

636
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,700
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

637
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

638
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,380
Year after year in the wandering,

639
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,940
I count the remaining years.

640
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,140
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

641
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,700
even though we have ended up the destiny,

642
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,380
I never feel regretful.

643
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,340
In such a chaotic world,

644
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,100
I still miss you as ever.

645
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,740
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

646
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,460
With a gentle heart,

647
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,020
I cherish our remaining years.

648
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,860
Even though we have to go through

649
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,820
all the hardships along the journey,

650
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:24,140
you always stay by my side,

651
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,900
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

652
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,820
Year after year in the wandering,

653
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,180
I count the remaining years.

654
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,540
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

655
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,340
even though we end up the destiny,

656
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,780
I never feel regretful.

657
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,700
In such a chaotic world,

658
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,660
I still miss you as ever.

659
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,340
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

660
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,100
With a gentle heart,

661
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,500
I cherish our remaining years.

662
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,300
Even though we have to go through

663
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,460
all the hardships along the journey,

664
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:04,740
you always stay by my side...
