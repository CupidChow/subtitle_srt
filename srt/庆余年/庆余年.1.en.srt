1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 1

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,580
=Zhang Qing, a university student=

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,300
=Professor Ye, a university professor=

18
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,550
I've told you many times that

19
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,360
I will never tutor any students.

20
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,760
Please have a look at it first.

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,870
About the thesis you emailed me,

22
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,800
I've already read it

23
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,040
and replied it as well.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,760
I've made it clearly that

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,230
I don't agree with you about

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,870
analyzing History of Ancient Literature

27
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,760
with modern ideas.

28
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,750
So don't waste your time any more.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,000
This is not a thesis.

30
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,000
It's an online contest

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,910
about science fiction held by Tencent.

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,830
This is the schedule.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,030
Contestants should deliver
their manuscripts every week.

34
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,080
Every week,

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,830
they will eliminate some of them.

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,800
And the last one left will be the champion.

37
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,800
Why do you tell me this?

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,550
It makes no sense.

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,320
You object the collision between modern ideas

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,440
and ancient literature

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,670
because it's a topic

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,800
that can't be testified.

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,520
But what if I use another way?

44
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,000
I have registered for the contest.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,880
It's a theme about science fiction.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
The story is the collision of modern ideas

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,550
and ancient systems.

48
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,960
The topic is

49
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,880
“If You Have a Chance to Live Once Again”.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,190
Why do you choose the topic

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,110
about another chance to live?

52
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,750
In everyone's mind,

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
more or less,

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,630
all of us may think about to live once again

55
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,080
because we have too many regrets

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
in our whole life.

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
So the real significance of this story is that

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
we should cherish the present life

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,360
and live for happiness.

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,600
You can't even write the first word out?

61
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,880
Of course not.

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,270
I have finished the first chapters.

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,750
But now I just need a name.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,670
The second version of "A Dream of Red Mansions"

65
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,960
published by the Humanities Club in 1957.

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,360
“Leave behind a residue of joy! ”

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,800
Fortunate enough your mother, your own mother,

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,110
will have laid by a store of virtue and
secret meritorious actions!

69
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,520
My advice to you, mankind, is to relieve
the destitute and succour the distressed!

70
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,190
Do not resemble those

71
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,390
who will harp after lucre and show themselves
unmindful of the ties of relationship:

72
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,800
that wolflike maternal uncle of yours
and that impostor of a brother!

73
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,630
“Leave behind a residue of joy! ” from the twelve songs

74
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,750
in The Dream of the Red Chamber.

75
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,000
What a coincidence!

76
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,800
This song

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,880
matches my story well.

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,320
Excuse me?

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,160
Could you please connect my computer

80
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,360
with that screen?

81
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,880
Okay.

82
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,500
Joy of Life

83
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,920
The story starts from here.

84
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,920
There's a young man in the modern times
who suffers from myasthenia gravis.

85
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,480
When he wakes up,

86
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,720
he finds that he becomes a baby in a bamboo basket

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
but he still keeps all memories

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,320
about the modern society.

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,390
Now he is surrounded and
attacked by killers in ancient costumes.

90
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,270
When he is still in doubt,

91
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,480
a fresh new world is welcoming him.

92
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,780
=Wuzhu, servant of Fan Xian's late mother=

93
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,040
=Chen Pingping, Head of the Investigator's Office=

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,790
Where is Your Lady?

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,070
It's too late when I rushed back.

96
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,880
People in the whole city wanted to kill her.

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,070
Is it her kid?

98
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

99
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,950
Is he still alive?

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,550
Yes, he is.

101
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,480
Let me take a look.

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,270
Where do you want to take him?

103
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,790
A safe place.

104
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,920
Now that I am back,

105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,440
the capital city is the safest place for him.

106
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,440
When My Lady was killed,

107
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,040
why did you and your black knights

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,880
not stay in the capital city?

109
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,640
I did it as what I was told.

110
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,600
You mean there is a hidden force

111
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,670
behind the killing?

112
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,760
Everyone in the city,

113
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,720
I

114
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,950
never trust them.

115
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,880
So, you just take him away like this?

116
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,070
What can you teach him?

117
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,640
Wuzhu.

118
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,920
You are most skilled at martial arts in the world,

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,880
but all you know is killing people.

120
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,160
And you are no different.

121
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,600
Stop!

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,640
There is a place suitable for him.

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,160
Where is it?

124
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,550
Danzhou.

125
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,550
You know that place.

126
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,510
The Madam lives there.

127
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,670
I have the memories about the modern life,

128
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,600
but now I become a kid.

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,880
The fate gives me a chance to

130
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,200
get rid of an incurable disease

131
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,350
and live my life once again,

132
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,230
I will never miss it.

133
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,820
The Fan Mansion

134
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,910
About my present name,

135
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,790
I am Fan Xian,

136
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,470
I know what's in your mind.

137
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,000
This name

138
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,030
is really annoying.

139
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,380
=Infant Fan Xian=

140
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,230
You don't know?

141
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,200
Stop it!

142
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,230
Stop it!

143
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,590
=Butler Zhou, butler of the Fan mansion in Danzhou=

144
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,550
My Lady.

145
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,910
You're back finally!

146
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,280
=Boy Fan Xian=
Both of them are servant girls in my yard.

147
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,710
Did you beat them?

148
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,080
Young Master, you like running around,

149
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,320
it's fine.

150
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,230
But you shouldn't

151
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,670
take My Lady with you.

152
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,520
If anything bad happens,

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,590
you will

154
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,840
never afford to bear the responsibility.

155
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Do you think so?

156
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,230
I ask whether you beat them or not.

157
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,400
They don't know

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
where you have gone.

159
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
They really don't know that.

160
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,640
So they should be punished.

161
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,350
Am I right?

162
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,110
Well, they are my maids,

163
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,440
should they be under my charge?

164
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,760
Madam asks me to be the butler,

165
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,960
then I think

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,840
I still have the right to teach them.

167
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,520
You don't know.

168
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
- You don't know. - Stop it.

169
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,000
Young Master.

170
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,000
Then I go on helping you teach them.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,910
Stop it.

172
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,520
Stop it.

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,150
You... What are you...

174
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,400
Come over here.

175
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,960
Closer.

176
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,110
Put your head straight.

177
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,350
Do you have any problems with that?

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,150
It's right and proper for you to beat me.

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,840
Serve the meal.

180
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,150
Serve the meal.

181
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,710
=Madam Fan, Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian's mother=

182
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,840
Who did it?

183
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,280
Madam.

184
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,520
It's the Young Master.

185
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,550
You beat him?

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,030
Grandma, have you eaten?

187
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,110
I am asking you.

188
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,880
I did it.

189
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,910
Butler Zhou beat the servant girls
=Fan Ruoruo, Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian's daughter=

190
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,000
in brother's yard first!

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,880
Alright.

192
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,030
Butler Zhou.

193
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,280
Madam.

194
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,080
Change those servant girls

195
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,080
in his yard.

196
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,470
I will.

197
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,790
I am going to find some sensible girls

198
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,110
for Young Master now.

199
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,280
No need, grandma.

200
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,440
I like it quiet in my yard.

201
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,320
From today on,

202
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,550
I don't need any servants any more.

203
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,550
Then remove all of them.

204
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, I'll do it right now.

205
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,590
The carriage is at the gate.

206
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,400
After the meal,

207
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,670
Ruoruo will set out and go back to the capital city.

208
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,440
How about my brother?

209
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,710
He will stay in Danzhou.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,670
Go ahead.

211
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,790
Young Master Fan Xian,

212
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,110
please don't be too sad.

213
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,880
Lady Ruoruo is born from a noble family,

214
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,200
she will go back to the capital city sooner or later.

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,520
Your name is not even in the family pedigree.
You are nobody in the family.

216
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,280
Lady Ruoruo is very different from you.

217
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,440
Well.

218
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
I have removed all the servant girls

219
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,230
in your yard.

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,320
In such a big yard,

221
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,320
when you are alone at night,

222
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,880
you should be careful

223
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,280
in case you see a ghost.

224
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,110
Did you lose your fore tooth?

225
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,110
Back tooth.

226
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,550
Then why do they leak air when you are speaking?

227
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,550
Leak air?

228
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,000
Just like

229
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,320
farting.

230
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,590
Are you Fan Xian?

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,910
There you are!

232
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Who am I?

233
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
You are my dad!

234
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,910
I...

235
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I am not your dad.

236
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,150
You are my dad for sure!

237
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,710
She prepared it for you.

238
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
What is it?

239
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,470
Bamboo leaf tea.

240
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,470
Who prepared it for me?

241
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,030
My mom.

242
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,080
Bullshit!

243
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,640
Your mom died on the day when you were born.

244
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,350
She did not.

245
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,470
The where is she?

246
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,520
She is over there.

247
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,030
Dead.

248
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,910
The shop is closed.

249
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,880
You should come tomorrow
if you want to buy something.

250
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,790
Somebody wants to kill me.

251
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,820
=Wuzhu, servant of Fan Xian's late mother=
Do you want me to report to the government?

252
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,350
You should take care of me, shouldn't you?

253
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,440
Uncle Wuzhu.

254
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,640
Uncle Wuzhu. Open the door.

255
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,920
I killed a man.

256
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,230
He is not dead.

257
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,040
He is going to wake up.

258
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
His name is Fei Jie.

259
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
He is the Director of the Third Division

260
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,920
of the Investigator's Office in the capital city.

261
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,520
He is one of us.

262
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,760
Well, when I was knocking him,

263
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,800
why didn't you tell me?

264
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,830
You didn't ask me.

265
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,310
Well, what to do now?

266
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,310
I have knocked him for three times.

267
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,920
Will he remember it and bear the grudges?

268
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,190
He is one of us?

269
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,830
Why does he have such a wretched appearance?

270
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,020
=Fei Jie, director of the Third Division of the Investigator's Office=

271
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,950
You wake up?

272
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,230
What happened to me just now?

273
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
You fell asleep while sitting up.

274
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,400
Actually you were knocked out by someone.

275
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,800
Is that you?

276
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,310
No, it's not.

277
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,280
Then, who did it if it was not you?!

278
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
He knocked you out.

279
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,920
Wuzhu.

280
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,000
Wuzhu.

281
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,880
It's been a long time since we
parted in the capital city last time.

282
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,640
You look the same as ever.

283
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,000
I have been always missing you.

284
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,560
Why are you here?

285
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
His Excellency Fan and the Head

286
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,640
asked me to be Fan Xian's master.

287
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,350
My father asked you to be here?

288
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,000
His Excellency Fan has no time to come here.

289
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,430
But he is always missing you.

290
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,350
It's my fault and

291
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,560
I shouldn't sneak around.

292
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,800
No wonder you knocked me out.

293
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,920
It's not me.

294
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,760
It's him!

295
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,470
Not one.

296
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,400
But three times.

297
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,000
For mother only

298
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,880
Madam.

299
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,800
This is a letter

300
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,430
from His Excellency Fan.

301
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,070
What happened to your head?

302
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,710
I was attacked by someone on my way here.

303
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,920
Has the criminal been arrested?

304
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,040
Sorry to annoy you.

305
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,640
He has been arrested.

306
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,110
That's good.

307
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,310
You told me that

308
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,400
my son asked you to be here

309
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,190
from far away to

310
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,400
teach Fan Xian?

311
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,230
That's right.

312
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,830
What will you teach him?

313
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,950
Actually I know something
about civil and military skills.

314
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,310
Could you please tell me

315
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,590
what I could teach him?

316
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,520
You may do what you think is suitable.

317
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,950
What he could learn

318
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,190
depends on himself.

319
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,950
Where is the kitchen?

320
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,400
It's not the meal time.

321
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,350
Well, I... I am hungry.

322
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,800
Tell me where the kitchen is.

323
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I want something to eat.

324
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,280
There is no food.

325
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,950
You just tell me

326
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,040
where the kitchen is.

327
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,230
It's over there.

328
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Mr. Fei.

329
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,560
May I talk to you for a minute?

330
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,560
Okay.

331
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,430
Mr. Fei.

332
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,230
What will you teach him?

333
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,110
Please give me some advices.

334
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,640
You must have heard

335
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,470
what the Madam has said

336
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,070
Yeah.

337
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,880
What you should teach and shouldn't,

338
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,000
you must figure it out in your mind.

339
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,880
How about teaching him to read

340
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,040
but nothing else?

341
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,310
That's too mean.

342
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,950
Then I can teach him to practice medicine.

343
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,430
Practice medicine?

344
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,160
If he is driven out of the family,

345
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,190
he could be a doctor to

346
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,920
raise money and feed himself.

347
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,830
It's up to you.

348
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,470
Your father has married another woman

349
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,040
in the capital city.

350
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,800
And they have a son now.

351
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,310
I know it.

352
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,190
He even doesn't salute when seeing me.

353
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
You thought I can't see it,

354
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,800
and then you can fool me?

355
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,590
I'm telling you. No way.

356
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,430
How about killing him?

357
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,190
I will make it natural.

358
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,920
That guy is hateful,

359
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,190
but we can't go so far as to kill him.

360
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,040
Right.

361
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,280
Let me know if you change your mind.

362
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,830
I'm telling you.

363
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,710
After having the porridge,

364
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,190
I will go back to the bedroom
and have a good rest.

365
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,310
You really knocked hard on my head.

366
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,310
When I wake up, I will teach you.

367
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,310
What will you teach me?

368
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,430
Medicine.

369
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
Medicine?

370
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,520
These are some unmarked graves.

371
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,040
I could tell.

372
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,400
Just pick one.

373
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,190
Dig it out.

374
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,520
It's done.

375
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,880
Open it.

376
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,640
Alright.

377
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,880
Why don't you ask me the reason?

378
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,310
For what?

379
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,950
Why do I ask you to open the coffin?

380
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,590
I should know human's body first.

381
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,000
And then get a dead body to dissect.

382
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,310
This is the first step for my study.

383
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,590
That's normal.

384
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,950
Open it.

385
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,280
It's still fresh.

386
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,430
Cut it open.

387
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,040
Check out the cause of death.

388
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,830
Cut it.

389
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,640
Are you afraid?

390
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,110
There are too many bacteria here.

391
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,800
I should get protected.

392
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,160
What is bacteria?

393
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,680
I mean it's dirty.

394
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,160
I'd better put on a pair of gloves at least.

395
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,280
When you cut a body open,

396
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,350
you should use your hands to get every detail.

397
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,110
It's not convenient to dissect a body

398
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,400
when you wear a pair of gloves.

399
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,230
It's not what you wear in winter.

400
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,640
The gloves for operation are very thin.

401
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,350
They are close fitting, do you know that?

402
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
About the gloves you just mentioned,

403
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,590
I have never heard about it before.

404
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,830
After the dissection,

405
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,560
you can wash your hands.

406
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,640
Uncle Wuzhu is awesome.

407
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,880
He even could compete with the Four Great Masters.

408
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,400
If it were not for Wuzhu's low profile,

409
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,000
he would be famous

410
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,470
and become the fifth great master

411
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,760
in the world.

412
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,950
What's the relationship between
my mom and Uncle Wuzhu?

413
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,710
He was your mother's servant.

414
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,520
Well, my mom must be more awesome!

415
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,800
Your mother actually was unparalleled in the world.

416
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,760
How did she die that year?

417
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,280
I can't tell you.

418
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,800
Just tell me a little.

419
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,680
You talk too much.

420
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,470
You can't bear it, can you?

421
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,640
You...

422
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,920
There is something that you can't bear?

423
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,110
Teacher, I am still a kid.

424
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,310
Uncle.

425
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,430
I have dissected the body for a whole night.

426
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,310
And you just cook this for me?

427
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,430
Yeah.

428
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,830
Will you put some ingredients into it?

429
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,520
No.

430
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,040
Did my mom teach you how to cook it?

431
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,800
What do you want to say?

432
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,400
What kind of person my mom is?

433
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,830
Her name is Ye Qingmei.

434
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,950
What else?

435
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,590
The others...

436
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
I've forgotten all of them.

437
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,920
You gave me

438
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,230
this secret skills about vitality Qi.

439
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,160
Do you remember it?

440
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,950
It's your mother who gave it to you.

441
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,350
I have practiced it

442
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,800
and I got some problems.

443
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,310
I can't control it. It's really overbearing.

444
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,640
Uncle.

445
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,470
Does it have a name?

446
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,310
Yes.

447
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,430
What is it?

448
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,110
“Overbearing Vitality Qi”.

449
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,110
It seems like

450
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,760
you name it just now?

451
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,760
If I can't control it well,

452
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,830
I'm afraid it will do harm to my body.

453
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,590
Uncle.

454
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,760
How can I practice it?

455
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,070
I have no idea.

456
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,470
I haven't practiced it.

457
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,470
But my teacher told me you are super awesome.

458
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,160
Not bad.

459
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,430
Did my mother die of anger because of you?

460
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,310
I've forgotten it.

461
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,400
Well, about my problem,

462
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,830
what on earth should I do?

463
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,190
Finish the radish and follow me.

464
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,830
To where?

465
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,110
Use the Qi

466
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,070
and fill it to your feet.

467
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,640
The speed will be faster.

468
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,590
I haven't practiced Kungfu

469
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,470
and don't know how to use the Qi.

470
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,400
So I find out a way

471
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,950
to practice your skills.

472
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,070
What is it?

473
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,160
I will beat you.

474
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,160
And then?

475
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,160
You dodge.

476
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,190
And this is your way?

477
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,830
If only you have a good judgement,

478
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,800
response, speed

479
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
and power,

480
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,470
try to dodge.

481
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,830
Once again.

482
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
It's okay.

483
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,830
Kids like sleeping.

484
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,230
Think about it. What poison is it?

485
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,070
When were you poisoned?

486
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
And how?

487
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,520
When I was picking up the chopsticks,

488
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,190
you poisoned me.

489
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,280
It tastes astringent,

490
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,920
so you mixed it in the edible wild herbs.

491
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,110
You can choose one as I teach you.

492
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,520
No.

493
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,000
What about...

494
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,350
Take it if you make your decision.

495
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,430
... this one?

496
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,800
You will know after taking it.

497
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,470
What's wrong?

498
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,640
Teacher, what happened to me?

499
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,710
Your choice is wrong.

500
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,590
But the smell in the other bottles

501
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,760
is not right.

502
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,800
I told you to choose one bottle,

503
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,110
but I didn't say

504
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,680
the cure was among them.

505
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,830
Teacher, you are too...

506
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,310
Teacher.

507
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,710
You went too far.

508
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,710
Why didn't you say you went too far

509
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,070
when you knocked me out?

510
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
If you have any problems with that,

511
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,400
you can poison me.

512
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,640
If you can make it,

513
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,310
then we can finish the apprenticeship.

514
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,110
It's my turn to teach him today.

515
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,680
Let me teach him today.

516
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,070
Uncle.

517
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,230
I think I can't make it forever.

518
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,040
You just need time.

519
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,350
My teacher said

520
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
you were on the same level
with the Four Great Masters.

521
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,830
Kind of.

522
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,560
Have you fought with them?

523
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Not all of them.

524
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,680
Who won?

525
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,230
I made it even.

526
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,920
They are the most powerful four men in the world.

527
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,590
You have never learned Kungfu,

528
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,920
how can you make it even with them?

529
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,520
If only you are fast

530
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,280
and strong enough.

531
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
How powerful should you be to
match with those great masters?

532
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,110
Uncle Wuzhu.

533
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,800
Uncle, in the front is a cliff.

534
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,070
If you could be so powerful as me,

535
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,000
then you can make it.

536
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,320
Uncle.

537
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,190
Is he a real human?

538
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,470
Teacher, please have a seat.

539
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,040
This is the poisoned tea I just made.

540
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,840
Please have a taste.

541
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,040
Tharm-cutting flower again?

542
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,840
But I didn't put it in the tea.

543
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,080
How did you make it?

544
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,320
The inner part is toxic but the skin is not.

545
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,630
Just think about it.

546
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,520
Gotcha!

547
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,120
What poison is it?

548
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,670
It's not the poison but time.

549
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
These days,

550
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,950
you had a lot of good tonics.

551
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,120
Teacher, you are not poisoned.

552
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,910
You just had too many tonics and

553
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,120
you have too prosperous qi and blood.

554
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,360
You are so smart.

555
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,600
That's a unique way.

556
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,190
Now my apprenticeship is finished?

557
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,430
I can finish the apprenticeship
if I poison you successfully?

558
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,360
Yes.

559
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,280
I made it!

560
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,630
All good things come to an end. I should go now.

561
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,470
Stop here.

562
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,760
These years,

563
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,800
the only person who I can completely trust

564
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,950
is Uncle Wuzhu.

565
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,600
He totally deserves it.

566
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,230
But now I have another people who I can trust.

567
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,950
Don't forget you have such a naughty student

568
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,360
like me in Danzhou.

569
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,120
Here you are.

570
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,760
It's the token of Director-General
of the investigator's office.

571
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,910
The Head asked me to give it to you.

572
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,320
Did he know me?

573
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,670
He knows your mother.

574
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,190
And I have something for you.

575
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,080
It's made of lamb intestine.

576
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,280
You can put it on

577
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,320
when you dissect bodies or test the poisons.

578
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,600
I will.

579
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,040
I like it.

580
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,430
If I met you earlier,

581
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,190
I may choose another way.

582
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,430
Maybe I would marry a woman

583
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,150
and have a naughty boy

584
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,520
like you.

585
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,150
Teacher.

586
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,430
I will take care of you when you are old
and give proper burial after your death.

587
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,670
He left and it turns out to be a good thing.

588
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,760
If he stays here,

589
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,560
he will attract people's attention

590
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,080
from the capital city.

591
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,760
Am I in danger?

592
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,910
If the red-armor knights

593
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,320
appear in the street here,

594
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,230
the real danger will come.

595
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
Who are the red-armor knights?

596
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,230
Young Master Fan Xian, what are you doing?

597
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,150
I am waiting for the red-armor knights.

598
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,560
Who are they?

599
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,910
You don't understand.

600
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
=Fan Xian, bastard son of Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian=

601
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,360
Young Master Fan Xian.

602
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,670
Are you still waiting for the red-armor knights?

603
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,390
These people are here to escort me to the capital city?

604
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Who asked them here?

605
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,910
Your father, of course.

606
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,230
I have refused him.

607
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,560
The capital city is not a good place.

608
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,190
Your mother died there.

609
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,150
You can live longer if you stay here.

610
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,910
But they are kneeling out of the door.

611
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Leave them alone.

612
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,360
If they kneel there till they die, just bury them.

613
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,260
In the river of history,

614
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,460
time goes round and round.

615
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,820
Memories about the former and present lives

616
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,700
join each other in an endless way.

617
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,300
In the long drunken Milky Way,

618
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,020
one season follows another in a flash,

619
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,220
and the wild geese are flying south.

620
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,140
I just can't give up

621
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,140
to be with you for my whole life.

622
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,420
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

623
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,220
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

624
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,100
Year after year in the wandering,

625
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,660
I count the remaining years.

626
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,860
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

627
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,420
even though we have ended up the destiny,

628
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,100
I never feel regretful.

629
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,060
In such a chaotic world,

630
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,820
I still miss you as ever.

631
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,460
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

632
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,180
With a gentle heart,

633
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,740
I cherish our remaining years.

634
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,580
Even though we have to go through

635
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,540
all the hardships along the journey,

636
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:40,860
you always stay by my side,

637
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,620
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

638
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,540
Year after year in the wandering,

639
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,900
I count the remaining years.

640
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,260
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

641
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,060
even though we end up the destiny,

642
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,500
I never feel regretful.

643
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,420
In such a chaotic world,

644
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,380
I still miss you as ever.

645
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,060
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

646
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,820
With a gentle heart,

647
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,220
I cherish our remaining years.

648
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,020
Even though we have to go through

649
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,180
all the hardships along the journey,

650
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:21,460
you always stay by my side...
