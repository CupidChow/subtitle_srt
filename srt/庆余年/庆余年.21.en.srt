1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 21

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,440
Lin Gong joined hands with Si Lili

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,800
to try to assassinate Fan Xian on Niulan Street,

18
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,720
but Si Gujian lost a disciple and a follower

19
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,360
during the process.

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,080
The two female assassinators

21
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,550
were killed by Fan Xian.

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,000
Why did Si Gujian kill Lin Gong

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,270
to take revenge?

24
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,800
Everyone knows that

25
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,480
Si Gujian is obsessed with swordsmanship.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,870
Fan Xian killed the two assassinators

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,440
when he was attacked.

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,360
Si Gujian would think highly of him

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
because of his capabilities.

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,120
And he'd only take revenge on

31
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,270
Lin Gong and Beiqi

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,600
that are behind all this.

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,600
Wait.

34
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,630
How does it relate to Beiqi?

35
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,390
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,960
Lin Gong tried to assassinate Fan Xian

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,880
because he was fooled by secret agents.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,830
Beiqi disturbed the peace in the capital city

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,160
and then got Si Gujian

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,000
involved into this case.

41
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,240
They're really evil-minded.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,390
Your Majesty, please dispatch troops

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,320
and go on a punitive expedition against Beiqi.

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,670
What? Dispatch troops?

45
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,670
Exactly.

46
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
Dispatch troops?

47
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,910
We can't do that without careful thought.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,880
Prime Minister, what do you think?

49
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,720
Prime Minister.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,000
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,270
I beg you to bring fair back

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,750
to my dead son.

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,360
Prime Minister, you're the most important official.

54
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,630
Come on. Rise.

55
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,600
Your Majesty,

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,630
I beg you to bring fair back

57
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,600
to my dead son!

58
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,360
In this case, I'll order

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,390
Dongyi Town to hand over the killer.

60
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,600
As for Beiqi...

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,160
I've never thought about

62
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,630
getting into a fight with them,

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,800
but they've gone too far in bullying us.

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,240
They're pressing on step by step.

65
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,630
So,

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,910
let's go to war.

67
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,720
I'll take a nation's strength

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,880
to punish the wicked.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,230
I see.

70
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,320
Good.

71
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,230
Everything is clear now.

72
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,880
You!

73
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,440
Your Majesty.

74
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,920
You slandered your brother,

75
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,640
so you'll be grounded for three days.

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,200
Read more classics.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
Both of you can leave.

78
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,230
Your Highness.

79
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,510
As brothers,

80
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,950
we haven't had a heart-to-heart talk for long.

81
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,670
How about getting together someday?

82
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll be grounded for three days.
I don't dare to disobey the order.

83
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,950
Prime Minister,

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
you lost your son.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,510
I understand how you're feeling,

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,830
but the war is going to start.

87
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,880
You have to take good care of yourself.

88
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,550
The six ministries need your management.

89
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,830
I have

90
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,350
mixed feelings

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
that are beyond words.

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,510
It's okay as long as it's clear in your mind.

93
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,110
Your Majesty,

94
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,270
I have one more request.

95
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,320
Go ahead.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,070
Now that the whole thing came to light,

97
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,040
I hope Head Chen

98
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,670
can have my son's body

99
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,830
sent to my mansion.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,760
He made a big mistake,

101
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,950
but he's my son, anyway.

102
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,720
I want to have his bones buried.

103
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,160
It's only right and proper.

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll have him

105
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,200
sent back later.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,880
In this case, your subordinate takes his leave.

107
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,510
Prime Minister.

108
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,550
Prime Minister,

109
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,270
considering what happened between your son and Fan Xian,

110
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,480
do you want to

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,670
invalidate Wan'er's marriage contract

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,510
to Fan Xian?

113
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,510
It's my son that made a mistake.
It has nothing to do with Fan Xian.

114
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Besides, Fan Xian did a lot

115
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,920
to chase secret agents of Beiqi.

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
We don't need to

117
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,510
invalidate their marriage contract.

118
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,350
You lost your son.

119
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,320
According to etiquette,

120
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,830
no wedding ceremonies
should be held in three years in your mansion.

121
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,830
Wan'er

122
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,000
has nothing to the Lin mansion in name.

123
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,000
They can get married

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,440
as scheduled.

125
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,350
Right. It makes sense.

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,390
Their marriage contract will remain unchanged.

127
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,510
But the war is going to begin,

128
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,920
so let's talk about their wedding ceremony

129
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,350
after the war ends.

130
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,320
Your Majesty, it's a wise decision.

131
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,000
See Prime Minister out.

132
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,230
Your Majesty, I'm leaving too.

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,230
You're still here?

134
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,880
Yes.

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,640
Okay.

136
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,160
Eunuch Hou, don't bother.

137
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,600
We'll leave by ourselves.

138
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,760
I'd better see you out.

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,270
Let's go.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
Si Gujian killed Lin Gong?

141
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,950
It's ridiculous.

142
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,270
It's true that Lin Gong was killed

143
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,640
by a skilled swordsman.

144
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,280
Do you think Lin Ruofu bought the story?

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,230
It doesn't matter as long as the common people are convinced.

146
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,590
Did you

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,470
really see the Second Prince

148
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,550
and Xie Bi'an that day?

149
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,640
Yes, I did.

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,670
Then the Second Prince couldn't have done that.

151
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,760
Isn't it Si Gujian?

152
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,840
Did a Great Master come here

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,640
to kill Gong'er

154
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,880
just for his two unknown followers?

155
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,550
Uncle, you don't believe that?

156
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm not stupid.

157
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,520
In this case,

158
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,880
why didn't you say it out?

159
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,470
His Majesty acted in concert with Chen Pingping

160
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,710
just to draw a final decision.

161
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,470
Nobody cares if I believe it or not.

162
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,840
Is it the answer His Majesty wants?

163
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
It's the answer Nanqing wants.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,790
It'll be used as a perfect excuse

165
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,840
to send armed forces to attack Beiqi.

166
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,960
The common people will be filled with a common hatred.

167
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,000
What a good answer!

168
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,320
How about the truth about Lin Gong's death?

169
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,230
There'll be no truth at all.

170
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,710
The reason why Nanqing wants to attack Beiqi

171
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,520
has to be beyond all doubt.

172
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,000
I won't be able to find out the truth anymore.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,590
All our grievances

174
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,760
and sorrow

175
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,230
have to be hidden behind that.

176
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,150
I'm not a qualified father.

177
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,550
I don't deserve to be his father.

178
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
Lin Gong was really killed

179
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,550
by a martial arts master.

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,590
Is Wuzhu in the capital city or not?

181
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,110
I don't know.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,230
No matter if he's here,

183
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,640
we have to insist the killer should be Si Gujian.

184
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,030
We can't let anyone else

185
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,760
know that Wuzhu is alive.

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,280
The Investigator's Office

187
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,000
is erasing all information about him.

188
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,350
Try to find him.

189
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,470
Don't believe Chen Pingping.

190
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,880
Stay away from him as much as possible.

191
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,710
What kind of person is he?

192
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,710
He's well known for being resourceful,

193
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,520
capricious and ruthless.

194
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,840
Nobody can gain an insight into his mind.

195
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,710
Do you hold a post

196
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,110
in the Investigator's Office?

197
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

198
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,350
Don't get involved too much.

199
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,910
After you marry Wan'er,

200
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,640
I'll find a way

201
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
to transfer you to the Ministry of Personnel.

202
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,670
It'll be safer to work there.

203
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,910
Besides,

204
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
don't be curious

205
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,590
about the truth of Gong'er's death.

206
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,110
Don't investigate it anymore.

207
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,150
Of course I won't.

208
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,550
The secrets behind all this

209
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,960
will be more than you can bear.

210
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,150
Uncle, did you

211
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,910
guess who is the killer?

212
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,440
Chen Pingping

213
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,790
wouldn't forge the wounds.

214
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,230
I'm afraid he was really killed

215
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,550
by a Great Master.

216
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,440
Among the four Great Masters,

217
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,030
Ku He is in Beiqi,

218
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,550
Si Gujian is in Dongyi

219
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,590
and Ye Liuyun roams about the world.

220
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,590
The three of them couldn't have done that.

221
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,550
How about the last one?

222
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,640
The last one

223
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,670
is in the imperial palace.

224
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,790
Who can order him to kill?

225
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,590
The Great Master in the imperial palace

226
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,000
will only listen to His Majesty.

227
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,000
Uncle.

228
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,280
Gong'er's death

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,350
just gives His Majesty a good excuse

230
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,030
to start the war.

231
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,110
The timing is perfect.

232
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,670
Do you suspect...

233
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,590
I'm just

234
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,150
talking about current affairs with you.

235
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,440
I suspect nobody.

236
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,520
Let's forget about it.

237
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,400
Don't mention it again.

238
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,590
I see.

239
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,880
Spend more time with Wan'er.

240
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,200
She has a good relationship with Gong'er

241
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,910
and she's been in poor health.

242
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,790
Don't let her

243
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,760
come over for the funeral.

244
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,910
Go to see her

245
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,320
and try to cheer her up.

246
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,030
Got it.

247
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,030
I have something else to do. You can leave.

248
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,640
What's up?

249
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,880
Her Highness wants to see you.

250
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,320
Show me the way.

251
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,670
Take this. It must be sweet.

252
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,080
You won't give short weight, right?

253
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,910
Which one do you prefer?

254
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,880
This one. I want this.

255
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,590
Okay.

256
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,910
Ruofu, don't be too sad.

257
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,400
Your Highness, thank you for your care.

258
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,110
I really appreciate it.

259
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,400
Do you really have to

260
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,670
talk to me like that?

261
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,440
It makes you sound distant.

262
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,000
You're a princess and I'm just a subordinate.

263
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,470
Your Highness,

264
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,030
you know well

265
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,030
that you don't love me at all.

266
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,030
You just want to

267
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,520
take advantage of me

268
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,640
as a powerful minister, right?

269
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,110
I know you're angry.

270
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,640
I don't mind you venting your anger on me.

271
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,080
Gong'er is not my son,

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,910
but I also want to

273
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,840
find out the killer.

274
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,200
Your Highness, don't bother.

275
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,470
His Majesty is wise.

276
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,150
He's found out the murderer.

277
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,880
I know you're not convinced.

278
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,960
Why do you want to see me?

279
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,640
I've heard you insisted on

280
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,760
Wan'er marrying Fan Xian.

281
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,150
Your Highness, you're well-informed.

282
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,840
She's my daughter.

283
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,640
I don't want her to marry Fan Xian.

284
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,710
He's a bumpkin.

285
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,350
Do you hate to part with Wan'er

286
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
or to lose control of Neiku?

287
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,200
I didn't expect you'd look down upon me so much.

288
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,150
Li Yunrui,

289
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,520
we know each other so well.

290
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,550
Don't pretend to

291
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,030
be sad and sorrowful

292
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,080
before me.

293
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm Wan'er's mother.

294
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I don't want her to marry him.

295
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,030
Why don't you go to His Majesty?

296
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,470
Do we really have to

297
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,880
talk like this?

298
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,440
Wan'er likes him.

299
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,520
So what?

300
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,000
Her marriage

301
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,800
is up to you and me.

302
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,110
Since she was born,

303
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,830
I've seen her

304
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,070
few times.

305
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,070
I owe her too much.

306
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,760
So, I don't want to stop her

307
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,710
doing what she likes to do anymore.

308
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,040
Besides,

309
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,400
Fan Xian is nice to Dabao.

310
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,640
I'll be relieved

311
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,920
to let Fan Xian take care of the Lin family.

312
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,280
Do you know

313
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,470
he's a bastard son?

314
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,800
It's easier to support someone without influence.

315
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Wouldn't you ever think about me?

316
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,110
-Hurry. -Hurry.

317
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,310
Slow down.

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,070
Your Highness. Prime Minister.

319
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,560
Li Yunrui,

320
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,920
I've thought about it.

321
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,110
Neiku is not yours.

322
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,190
Let it go.

323
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,350
We'd better

324
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,520
not see each other again.

325
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,710
Kill them and throw them into the river.

326
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,190
Come here for fun!

327
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,640
Sir,

328
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,070
can you watch my kite for me?

329
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,430
I want to go and play for a while.

330
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,040
Go ahead.

331
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,800
Thank you.

332
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,430
Have you got over your cough?

333
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,800
Why are you here alone?

334
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,800
My second brother is dead.

335
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,680
I know.

336
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,920
I've heard

337
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,880
it's he that plotted the Niulan Street assassination.

338
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,400
Is it true?

339
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,350
Yes.

340
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,350
I remember

341
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,710
Teng Zijing's death

342
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,710
is a big blow to you.

343
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,310
You'd been trying to find out the one behind it,

344
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,110
right?

345
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah.

346
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,040
I have a question for you.

347
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,560
Don't lie to me.

348
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,710
Go ahead.

349
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,680
I won't lie to you.

350
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,190
Did you

351
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,560
kill my second brother?

352
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,560
No.

353
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Look at my eyes.

354
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,470
I didn't

355
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,470
kill Lin Gong.

356
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,190
Knowing he was killed,

357
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,230
I was both sad and worried.

358
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,560
I was afraid it's you

359
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,230
that killed him.

360
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,400
Did you plan to kill me with that sword

361
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,350
if it were me?

362
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,830
I'd kill myself.

363
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,190
It'd be too much for me to bear

364
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,520
if it were you.

365
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,350
I'd kill myself to keep Lin Gong company.

366
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,800
Head,

367
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,590
it's the cart of Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue ahead.

368
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,310
Stop him.

369
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,470
I have something to say to him.

370
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,710
Got it.

371
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,110
Keep your distance.

372
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,800
I've got cold hands and feet. I feel tired.

373
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,000
It's because of rapid changes in your mood.

374
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,710
You'll be alright after having a rest.

375
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,880
Head Chen said

376
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,470
it's Si Gujian that killed my second brother.

377
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,160
Yeah.

378
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
He also said

379
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,430
Beiqi cheated your second brother

380
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,680
and took this opportunity to

381
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,800
make mischief between Dongyi Town and Nanqing.

382
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,920
What an insidious act!

383
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,040
Luckily, Head Chen saw it through.

384
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,520
His Majesty decided to send armed force to attack them.

385
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,830
A war is coming?

386
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,190
A nation's strength will be taken

387
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,920
to avenge Lin Gong's death.

388
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,430
Lots of people will die.

389
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,880
You don't want to take revenge?

390
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,560
Yes, I do.

391
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
It's just that

392
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,920
it'll get many innocent people involved.

393
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,280
When will hatred end?

394
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,830
Silly girl.

395
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,000
Go to sleep.

396
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,430
I questioned you today.

397
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,040
Please don't get mad at me.

398
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,350
How could I?

399
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,160
I'll take you out of city

400
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,070
for a walk in a few days.

401
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,230
Out of city?

402
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
Your condition will get worse

403
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,470
if you stay here all the time.

404
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,070
You'll feel better if you go out for a walk.

405
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,160
It's okay as long as you stay with me.

406
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,520
I'll always stay with you.

407
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,000
Go to sleep.

408
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,430
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

409
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,920
It was quick.

410
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,830
You took him back

411
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,760
while I was not here.

412
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,800
And you also found a good girl for him.

413
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
I just want to use it as a chance

414
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,710
to seize back Neiku.

415
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,040
It's just about some money. Why don't you let it go?

416
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,160
The Investigator's Office couldn't have been set up

417
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,350
if she hadn't aided you financially.

418
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,190
Neiku is the source of revenue for the royal household.

419
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,430
If Fan Xian takes it over,

420
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,350
he'll become a target for all.

421
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,880
Listen to me.

422
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,000
Invalidate their marriage contract.

423
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,000
It's too late.

424
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,880
He wants to marry that girl.

425
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,590
The Ye family has lost control of Neiku.

426
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,830
Why do you get Fan Xian involved?

427
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,430
You wouldn't have given him that token

428
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,430
if you wanted him to stay away from all this.

429
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,520
You did that in the hope of

430
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,950
letting him take over the Investigator's Office, right?

431
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,230
I want him to inherit it.

432
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,070
Both the Investigator's Office

433
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,160
and Neiku are of great importance.

434
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,000
His Majesty is of great talent and bold vision.

435
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,880
I don't think he'd let Fan Xian hold the two posts concurrently.

436
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,000
The Investigator's Office is in the teeth of the storm.

437
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
Isn't it great to let Xian'er

438
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,070
just be a rich guy?

439
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,880
Without power, his wealth will finally

440
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,190
become a castle in the air

441
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,160
or an unrooted tree.

442
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,190
I'll protect him.

443
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,000
Don't forget

444
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,350
he almost lost his life

445
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,680
on Niulan Street.

446
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,520
I won't let such a thing

447
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,590
happen again.

448
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,470
He'll have nothing to worry about

449
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,760
if he takes over the Investigator's Office.

450
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's the best way of survival

451
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,070
to stay away from power struggle.

452
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,800
It seems

453
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
you can't convince me and vice versa.

454
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,230
It's always the case.

455
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,070
Fine.

456
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,760
Let's try to do all we can respectively.

457
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,880
Fan Xian's future

458
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,760
will be up to himself.

459
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay.

460
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,400
You don't want to take revenge?

461
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,710
Yes, I do.

462
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,350
It's just that

463
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,520
it'll get many innocent people involved.

464
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,560
When will hatred end?

465
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,110
The capital city is a dangerous place.

466
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,830
If you didn't choose to support someone,

467
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,280
it could

468
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,070
lead to your doom.

469
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
Did you

470
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,560
kill my second brother?

471
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,040
I won't be able to find out the truth anymore.

472
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,830
All our grievances

473
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,640
and sorrow

474
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,920
have to be hidden behind that.

475
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,190
I'll take a nation's strength

476
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,560
to punish the wicked.

477
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,470
We have to start the war!

478
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,350
Is it the answer His Majesty wants?

479
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,470
It's the answer Nanqing wants.

480
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,680
She said

481
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,710
it means

482
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,590
they've gone somewhere far far away.

483
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,640
Someday, I'll also go there.

484
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,590
When I see them again,

485
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,070
I'll tell them

486
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,400
it's been a long time and I miss them.

487
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,430
The one behind the assassination attempt is extremely powerful

488
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,520
now that it even dared to do it in public.

489
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,920
This is just the beginning.

490
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
The road ahead

491
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,950
will be full of hazards.

492
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,520
How do you know I'm here?

493
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,110
I saw everything.

494
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,190
Wan'er came to our mansion for you.

495
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,070
She asked me a lot

496
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,230
about your attitude toward Lin Gong.

497
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,430
I was worried,

498
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,310
so I followed her all the way.

499
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,000
I promised never to lie to her.

500
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,190
You didn't lie.

501
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,310
Brother, you didn't kill Lin Gong.

502
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,040
But I know

503
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,470
it's Wuzhu that did it.

504
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,680
I didn't tell her about that.

505
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,310
Honesty is extremely important

506
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,280
in a relationship.

507
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,560
I know.

508
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But what's more important,

509
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,920
you have to consider what'd happen if you tell the truth.

510
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,710
Both of you would be in pain

511
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,950
and then break up.

512
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,190
It does no good to either of you.

513
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,640
Wan'er is in poor health.

514
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,640
How could she bear such suffering?

515
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,880
But...

516
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,000
No "but"!

517
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,160
Brother,

518
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,350
sometimes,

519
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,040
lying with good intentions

520
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,800
might be the right thing to do.

521
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,070
Will you lie to me

522
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,430
if anything happens to you?

523
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Of course I won't.

524
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,880
But you just said...

525
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
I won't marry you. Why would I lie to you?

526
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,000
Fine. I can't refute what you said.

527
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,310
Because it makes sense.

528
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Sometime, I think

529
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,560
you're similar

530
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,430
to Wuzhu.

531
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,430
Really?

532
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,590
Is he

533
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,160
as beautiful as me?

534
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,800
Thank you for coming here and comforting me.

535
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,350
I feel better.

536
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,800
I've heard you were summoned to the imperial palace again.

537
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,040
How did it come out?

538
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,040
Lin Gong's case is resolved.

539
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,680
So quick!

540
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,110
It's a little complicated.

541
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,800
I'll explain it to you on our way back.

542
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,000
Do you mean

543
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,710
His Majesty wants to take this opportunity

544
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,760
to dispatch troops to attack Beiqi?

545
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,160
As an onlooker,

546
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,000
I think it's a complicated situation.

547
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,590
The Second Prince, the Crown Prince, the Prime Minister

548
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,950
and even Chen Pingping

549
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,070
are against each other.

550
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,230
Chen Pingping is protective towards you.

551
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,800
The Prime Minister is your future father-in-law.

552
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,280
The Second Prince treats you like a friend.

553
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,000
Except the Crown Prince,

554
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,310
everyone else is nice to you.

555
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,110
In this case,

556
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,280
you're extraordinary

557
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,920
at associating with people.

558
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,070
Are you trying to make fun of me?

559
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,830
You can realize it, anyway.

560
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,000
Each of them has their own perspective,

561
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,110
but there is one

562
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,400
with whom I think something is going wrong.

563
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,430
Who is it?

564
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,190
The Crown Prince.

565
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,590
What's wrong?

566
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,950
Without any other evidence

567
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,280
except that Lin Gong was killed by a skilled swordsman,

568
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,000
he even accused Li Chengze of murder.

569
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,000
When his argument was refuted easily,

570
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,040
he didn't do anything else to justify himself.

571
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,680
Don't you think he's too reckless?

572
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Anything wrong?

573
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,880
The Crown Prince showed his recklessness,

574
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,230
but nobody was surprised.

575
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,040
Even Chen Pingping

576
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,710
didn't think anything went wrong.

577
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,280
Brother, it's not been long since you came to the capital city.

578
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,800
People say

579
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,680
the Crown Prince has little talent and learning

580
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,800
and handles matters recklessly.

581
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Everyone is used to it.

582
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,110
That's why many people

583
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,830
changed to support the Second Prince.

584
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,350
I'm not used to it,

585
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,560
so I think it's weird.

586
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,830
If the Crown Prince really has little talent

587
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,800
as they said,

588
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,350
how could he have stayed in the Eastern Palace

589
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,520
for such a long time?

590
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,040
Maybe His Majesty is protective of him.

591
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,230
Is that all?

592
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Besides Chen Pingping

593
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,760
and Lin Ruofu who are full of cunny tricks,

594
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,470
His Majesty and the Second Prince are also there.

595
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,350
If the Crown Prince had any plot,

596
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
they must've have seen it through.

597
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,350
Besides,

598
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,190
what happened today was a complete farce.

599
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,000
It did no good to him at all.

600
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,950
I wish it's me that thought too much.

601
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,950
Your Highness,

602
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,310
flowers in the backyard are in bloom.

603
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,070
How about going out for a walk?

604
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,230
His Majesty asked me to stay inside for three days.

605
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,430
It's our own yard.

606
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,950
I need to put a stop to all distracting thoughts.

607
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,950
You can leave.

608
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,400
Got it.

609
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,630
His Highness offended His Majesty again.

610
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,670
What should we do?

611
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,080
He's impulsive.

612
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,120
If it goes on like this,

613
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,800
how could he defeat the Second Prince?

614
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,120
Yeah. I've heard the Second Prince...

615
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,910
Hush!

616
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,840
Got it.

617
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,520
Stop gossiping. Go.

618
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,360
Si Lili.

619
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm Chen Pingping.

620
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,760
You must've heard that

621
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,840
I'm in charge of everything in the Investigator's Office.

622
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,950
I have a question.

623
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,520
Did you tell Fan Xian

624
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,150
it's Lin Gong

625
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,800
that plotted the Niulan Street assassination?

626
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,870
No. I didn't.

627
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,430
You shouldn't have hesitated.

628
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,870
Tomorrow morning at the imperial court,

629
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,560
His Majesty will tell everyone secret agents of Beiqi

630
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,600
sowed discord between Nanqing and Dongyi Town

631
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,710
and assassinated

632
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,150
the second son of the Prime Minister,

633
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,630
so we'll declare war on Beiqi.

634
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,870
The Nanqing army will

635
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,630
set foot on the border

636
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,040
and attack Beiqi in a day.

637
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,670
Sowed discord between Nanqing and Dongyi Town?

638
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,470
Si Gujian killed Lin Gong.

639
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
It's Beiqi

640
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,390
that plotted this matter.

641
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,520
Si Gujian?

642
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,710
As a secret agent of Beiqi,

643
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,390
you're supposed to be killed before the war starts.

644
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,230
But I'm the only one

645
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,360
that can keep you safe.

646
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,280
Understand?

647
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,950
What's the price for it?

648
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,320
From now on,

649
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,560
no matter who asks you

650
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,470
the question I asked just now,

651
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,280
don't hesitate.

652
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,760
There is only one answer:

653
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,150
you didn't tell Fan Xian the truth.

654
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,230
Fan Xian doesn't have reason to kill Lin Gong.

655
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,280
Who is he to you?

656
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,600
What's your relationship?

657
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,040
If you give the wrong answer,

658
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,800
nobody can keep you safe.

659
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,950
If you want to protect Fan Xian,

660
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,950
you just need to kill Si Lili.

661
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,390
Fan Xian promised to spare her life.

662
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Even I am curious

663
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,280
who he is to you.

664
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,910
An old friend.

665
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,630
He was brought up in Danzhou.

666
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,150
How could you have met him?

667
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,230
Ruohai,

668
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,320
how long have you been working here?

669
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,840
I don't remember.

670
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,630
Among all directors,

671
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,560
only two can bear heavy responsibilities.

672
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,320
One is you

673
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,230
and the other is Zhu Ge of the First Division.

674
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,360
On terms of experience and personal feeling,

675
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,000
the next Head of the Investigator's Office

676
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,320
will be one of you.

677
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,190
Why are you mentioning this?

678
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,710
If Fan Xian

679
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,230
is the next Head of the Investigator's Office,

680
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,430
what do you think?

681
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,080
The Investigator's Office is yours.

682
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,360
You can hand it over

683
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,760
to anyone you like.

684
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,760
Would you kill me

685
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,230
if I had expressed my discontentment?

686
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,000
We've been working together for years.

687
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,230
How could I do that?

688
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,000
We've been working together for years,

689
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,710
so I could tell

690
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,040
you wanted to kill me when I looked at your eyes.

691
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,630
Uncle.

692
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,320
Be careful when you come here again.

693
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,600
That guy called Shadow

694
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,360
keeps following me.

695
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,950
He's gone back to the Investigator's Office.

696
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,870
You knew that?

697
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,560
Chen Pingping wants to protect you.

698
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,840
Why?

699
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,800
Of course it's because of Lady Ye.

700
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,950
Who is my mom to him?

701
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,870
I can't remember.

702
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,600
I just know

703
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,040
it's Chen Pingping's black knights

704
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,840
that took revenge in the capital city

705
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,430
after Lady Ye was killed.

706
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,840
It turns out it's him.

707
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,470
I remember.

708
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,190
You have her eyes.

709
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,520
Who is she?

710
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,910
Ye Qingmei.

711
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,840
What's so magical about my mom?

712
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,360
She's the guider

713
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,630
and the betrayer.

714
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,230
She's like Nuwa who repaired the heaven.

715
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,080
She's the cause of every phenomenon on earth.

716
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,230
She's the end of finality.

717
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,630
Uncle.

718
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,910
What am I talking about?

719
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,280
Don't you know

720
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,710
what you just said?

721
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,190
I said them out

722
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,600
before I knew it.

723
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,710
They might come from the depths of my memory,

724
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,710
but I can't remember.

725
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,430
It's alright.

726
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,710
Take your time if you can't remember.

727
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,430
Uncle.

728
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,320
What's up, Uncle Wuzhu?

729
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,670
Uncle.

730
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:05,600
Uncle.

731
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,000
Uncle Wuzhu.

732
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,710
Uncle! Uncle!

733
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,320
I think I remember

734
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,520
where the Taiping Residence is.

735
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,800
Where is it?

736
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,910
2.5 km east of the city.

737
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,580
In the river of history,

738
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,780
time goes round and round.

739
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,140
Memories about the former and present lives

740
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,020
join each other in an endless way.

741
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,620
In the long drunken Milky Way,

742
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,340
one season follows another in a flash,

743
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,540
and the wild geese are flying south.

744
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,460
I just can't give up

745
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,460
to be with you for my whole life.

746
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,740
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

747
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,540
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

748
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,420
Year after year in the wandering,

749
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,980
I count the remaining years.

750
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,180
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

751
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,740
even though we have ended up the destiny,

752
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,420
I never feel regretful.

753
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,380
In such a chaotic world,

754
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,140
I still miss you as ever.

755
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,780
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

756
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,500
With a gentle heart,

757
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,060
I cherish our remaining years.

758
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,900
Even though we have to go through

759
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,860
all the hardships along the journey,

760
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:12,180
you always stay by my side,

761
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,940
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

762
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,860
Year after year in the wandering,

763
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,220
I count the remaining years.

764
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,580
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

765
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,380
even though we end up the destiny,

766
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,820
I never feel regretful.

767
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,740
In such a chaotic world,

768
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,700
I still miss you as ever.

769
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,380
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

770
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,140
With a gentle heart,

771
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,540
I cherish our remaining years.

772
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,340
Even though we have to go through

773
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,500
all the hardships along the journey,

774
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:52,780
you always stay by my side...
