1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 7

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,510
There's one more thing.

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,910
You must release Teng Zijing.

18
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,630
He had a record

19
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,680
in the Ministry of Penalty

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,400
and he came back to the capital with you.

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,550
I'm afraid he's up to something.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,870
He's my friend.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
It's too extravagant

24
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,550
to have a friend in the capital city.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,080
Sure, I'll have him released.

26
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,800
Be careful yourself.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,880
Why didn't you apologize

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,110
to Fan Sizhe just now?

29
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,960
How can a father

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,830
apologize to the son?!

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,080
Just stick to that sense of pride.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,360
Thank you!

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,670
Thank me?

34
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,630
I owe you one.

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,270
From today onwards,

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,550
I won't work against you

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,390
as long as you don't make it difficult to me.

38
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,470
Are you making peace with me?

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,670
Your guards

40
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,030
can't catch me at all.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,190
I didn't resist

42
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,240
for your sake.

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
I should thank you in that sense.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
Did you get the file?

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,030
Not yet!

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,160
Why?

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,670
It's said that it's hard to find as there are too many.

48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,960
Wang Qinian will send it to me tomorrow.

49
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,960
That's good!

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,630
I owe you on this.

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,520
Why does everyone owe me?

52
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,190
How about this?

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
I kill someone for you.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
Who... do you want to kill?

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,470
It's up to you.

56
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,830
I just come to the capital city

57
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,270
and hardly know any people.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,470
Shall I kill

59
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,360
Liu Ruyu for you?

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,630
Let's calm down!

61
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,630
I understand that

62
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,600
you want to express your gratitude to me.

63
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,320
But can you choose another way?

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,880
She is very suspicious

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,600
for the Danzhou assassination.

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,880
Suspicion is all it is about.

67
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,360
Besides, the Crown Prince is also suspicious.

68
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,910
You want to kill the Crown Prince?

69
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,550
It's a bit difficult.

70
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,360
We've gotta get it planned well.

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
Can we just have a normal conversation?

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,110
I have no other feat left.

73
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,440
I don't need your feat

74
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,800
and certainly not your meat either.

75
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,080
It's just a joke.

76
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,270
Have you heard of the saying that

77
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,830
the dancer goes feat not meat?

78
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,440
No!

79
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,630
Forget about it!

80
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,240
There is a guy named Xu Yunzhang
at the Investigator's Office.

81
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,110
Do you know him?

82
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,600
Just like me,

83
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,720
he is also from the Fourth Division of the Investigator's Office.

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,830
It was him who made up the secret order

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,920
for the Danzhou assassination.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,000
Does that mean

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,640
we can find out who is behind the scene

88
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,600
once we find him?

89
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,670
He is already dead.

90
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,320
Do you know who he usually contacted

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
when he was alive?

92
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm not familiar with him.

93
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,390
Making friends is really not something I'm good at.

94
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,270
Easy to tell.

95
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,480
Can I just kill a person for you?

96
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,510
Keep it on the account!

97
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,600
I shall turn to you immediately

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,760
if I want to have someone killed in future.

99
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,950
What's up?

100
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,070
I was wondering

101
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
there might be a place

102
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,950
where we can get some clues

103
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,070
about Xu Yunzhang before his death.

104
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,320
Then let's go now!

105
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,550
I'm a dead person now.

106
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
It's improper to show up in public.

107
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,720
I can do it myself.

108
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,160
What's your height?

109
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
What?!

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,760
Give me a ruler! I'll measure it.

111
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,950
Come on! Let's have a look!

112
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Sure! Put it here!

113
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,070
I'll have it later.

114
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,760
Watch out for me!

115
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,920
Has Fan Xian had anything?

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Send some food to him after a while.

117
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,720
Mine is ready.

118
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,440
Are you all ready?

119
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,670
So, here comes the first pair.

120
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,880
Once they are put down, it's fixed. No regret!

121
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,200
No change once you put it down.

122
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,350
I'll turn mine first.

123
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,200
Nine!

124
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,790
Not as big as mine!

125
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,510
That's too small!

126
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,920
Excuse me!

127
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,880
Excuse me! Excuse me!

128
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,070
Needless to see!

129
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,160
D three plus two four. That's Gee Joon.

130
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,320
Nothing can be bigger than this.

131
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,390
Let's see.

132
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,510
Mom, one tael please.

133
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
And one tael from sister.

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,950
Dad, you should

135
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,720
pay me for what you owed

136
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,440
from last game.

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,880
That's two taels five qians and eight fens.
(Qian and fen are currency units in ancient China.)

138
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,600
Right?

139
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,270
Don't kick me!

140
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,350
It's not necessary to calculate so clearly

141
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,440
within the family.

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,550
No, that's not right.

143
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,640
It needs to be super clear among family members.

144
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,760
Why would we play it if not for money?!

145
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,510
Don't you think so?

146
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,480
Come on!

147
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,720
let's not stop this

148
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,790
if we don't use up the money today, alright?

149
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,640
Let's keep playing then.

150
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,070
This is more like a family.

151
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,480
Stop cottoning up.

152
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,440
Financial matters should be settled
clearly though we are a family,

153
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,110
right?

154
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,720
One tael! One tael!

155
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,920
Two taels five qians and eight fens.

156
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
Thank you, dad!

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,160
It's done!

158
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,160
What are you doing?

159
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,200
You said there is a place

160
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
to find out some clues.

161
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,760
Wait for me.

162
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,640
How mysterious!

163
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,440
Here comes the Teens!

164
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,790
Money! Money! Money!

165
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,600
Come on, sister!

166
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,390
I don't have any money left.

167
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,440
That's not a problem.

168
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,790
I have a lot.

169
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,640
You are my biological elder sister,

170
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,350
you can borrow it from me

171
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,670
if only you pay me the interest.

172
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,230
What do you think?

173
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,830
It's getting dark.

174
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,230
Let's call it a day!

175
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,270
Mom,

176
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,000
did I win all the money

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,950
from dad just now?

178
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,160
Evidently!

179
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,720
Why didn't he scold me?

180
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
Excuse me! I've gotta go now!

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,200
What do you think of Fan Xian?

182
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,320
Not bad. He's a good guy!

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,350
He can fight and also write books.

184
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,160
The books he wrote are great!

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,920
They sell very well.

186
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,920
We even want to

187
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,390
open up book stores together.

188
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,350
That's not bad!

189
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,830
He can teach you a lot.

190
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,000
What's the matter, mom?

191
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,000
You have hated him

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
for a long time.

193
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,350
Now it seems we'd better

194
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,920
not be enemies of him.

195
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,920
You're right!

196
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,030
May I?

197
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,700
=Fan Mansion=

198
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,550
Ruoruo!

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,000
Brother, what are you doing?

200
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,400
It's pretty dry in the capital city.

201
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,910
I'm making a humidifier.

202
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,280
Humidifier?

203
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,230
It can humidify the air

204
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,230
in the room.

205
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,320
Can't you just put a barrel of water?

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,030
You won't understand

207
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
before I make it ready.

208
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,440
We should

209
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,440
make our life more exquisite.

210
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,790
By the way,

211
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
how was the Pai Gow?

212
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,280
Fan Sizhe won it all.

213
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,710
Are you here to borrow money?

214
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,880
No!

215
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,910
I'm here to tell you that

216
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,640
dad did not say any harsh words

217
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
to Fan Sizhe

218
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,080
while we were playing Pai Gow.

219
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,550
We were quite like a family.

220
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,880
That's so sweet.

221
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
Thanks to you!

222
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,080
Your presence seems

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,550
to change everything.

224
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,200
I can change nothing.

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,960
I don't have the capability, nor the willingness.

226
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,670
What happened, brother?

227
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,790
Nothing!

228
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,910
I went to the Investigator's Office today

229
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,030
and saw the words

230
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,150
left on the stele by my mom.

231
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
What does it say?

232
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
She wanted to change the rules

233
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,030
and reshape the world!

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,470
Reshape the world!

235
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,790
That sounds remarkable!

236
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
It's an implication to work against the world

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,960
with one's individual power.

238
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,030
It is indeed remarkable.

239
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,880
However, I'm not that type of person.

240
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,230
I just want to lead a regular life

241
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,670
and die in due course.

242
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,030
That's also good.

243
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,150
But I think

244
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,200
I'd live much more happily

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,880
if we really turn the world

246
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,320
into what is described on the stele.

247
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,320
Then turn it

248
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,350
into that.

249
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,080
The world would collapse

250
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,520
and turn into turmoil.

251
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,110
Whatever it is

252
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,280
as long as you like.

253
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,350
You have no principles, do you?

254
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,710
I believe you, brother.

255
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,030
Believing in you is my principle.

256
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,470
It's fine!

257
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,880
Nothing to hide from Ruoruo!

258
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,350
It's your call anyway!

259
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,030
What's this?

260
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,640
Nocturnal costume tailor-made according to your size.

261
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
What should I do with it?

262
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,790
Don't you want to find out clues?

263
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,960
Get changed and follow me!

264
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,590
Where are you going and for what?

265
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,470
Can I come along?

266
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,150
No!

267
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
What are you doing?

268
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,080
Brother, I've been dreaming to

269
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,960
start a night adventure

270
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,670
like this in tales.

271
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,960
I really made it.

272
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,590
Let me repeat it.

273
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,400
Only Fan Xian will be allowed

274
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,110
to get in.

275
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,880
Why?

276
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,470
Because only the person

277
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,640
who dressed up in this costume

278
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,350
can get in there.

279
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,440
What do you mean by get in?

280
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,280
There is a shop over there.

281
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,590
It sells nothing

282
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,470
but intelligence.

283
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,200
Regardless of the officialdom or the underworld,

284
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
they would all go for their luck

285
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,640
whenever they need any intelligence.

286
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,910
And certainly,

287
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,150
not everyone can get in there.

288
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,840
It needs connection and a lot of silvers.

289
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,550
Most importantly,

290
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,840
it's essential

291
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,960
to put on this nocturnal costume.

292
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,350
Whose costume is it?

293
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,960
Mine!

294
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,760
Fan Xian,

295
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,110
don't put up very high expectation on it.

296
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,110
Otherwise,

297
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,030
I would not have asked you to go to the Investigator's Office

298
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,000
to get that file for me.

299
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,790
What file?

300
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,670
From now on,

301
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,000
all three of us are normal people.

302
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,790
Don't act as if you had conversion disorder.

303
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,230
Let's go!

304
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,150
What file do you mean?

305
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,790
Is this it?

306
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,550
Yeah!

307
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,670
Zijing,

308
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,790
you described it mysterious,

309
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,960
but its facade is not at all hidden.

310
00:12:59,230 --> 00:12:59,880
It's run by swindler

311
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,760
at first sight.

312
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,790
We can go back now.

313
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,760
Now that we are here,

314
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,150
let me take a look inside.

315
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,590
I told you he is the only person to be allowed.

316
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Once bet, no regret!

317
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,440
What do we do next?

318
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,000
Wait!

319
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,880
Aren't we going?

320
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,400
It's better if we can observe on the roof.

321
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,790
Then let's go to the roof.

322
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,150
Are you able to?

323
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,670
No!

324
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,440
Then let's wait.

325
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,760
Come on! Once bet, no regret!

326
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,640
Once bet, no regret!

327
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,670
Big or small! Hurry up!

328
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,440
Here we go!

329
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,110
I need the connection details of Xu Yunzhang

330
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,520
from the Fourth Division of the Investigator's Office.

331
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,000
One moment.

332
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,790
Come on! Once again!

333
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,110
Come on! Once again!

334
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,150
Big or small?

335
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
Once bet, no regret!

336
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,590
There is bird in the sky so late.

337
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,640
It could be an owl.

338
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,150
Fine!

339
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,840
Your Majesty!

340
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,520
Fan Xian went to the shop that sells intelligence.

341
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,790
He is inquiring about Xu Yunzhang.

342
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,150
Give it to him then.

343
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,110
Your Majesty!

344
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,910
Come on! Once bet, no regret!

345
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,550
Once bet, no regret!

346
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,000
Bet on small! Big! Big! Big!

347
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There is both big and small.

348
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,280
Once bet, no regret! Once bet, no regret!

349
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,020
=Give it to Fan Xian.=

350
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,110
Three, five, four. Big!

351
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,470
What luck it is!

352
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,150
Sir,

353
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,670
here you are!

354
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,000
So you really have it.

355
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,910
Xu Yunzhang has connection

356
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,080
with the Eastern Palace.

357
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,640
That means the Crown Prince wanted to kill you.

358
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,400
This is not right!

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
All gone!

360
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Not a single people left.

361
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,880
Do you think

362
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,640
it's fake intelligence?

363
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,880
It has a lot of details

364
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,840
with collateral evidence.

365
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,880
It can't be faked.

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Why did you turn back?

367
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,030
Wang Qinian told me

368
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,520
the Head of the Investigator's Office

369
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,350
handled Xu Yunzhang's case in person.

370
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,470
So reasonably,

371
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
the intelligence about it

372
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,640
is super confidential.

373
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,590
But we got it

374
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,760
so easily.

375
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,280
Don't you think it's too smooth?

376
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,960
Besides,

377
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,030
my teacher told me

378
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,200
the Investigator's Office has enormous power.

379
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,320
That's true.

380
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,320
It can watch over all officials.

381
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,470
Everyone is afraid of it.

382
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,710
In view of this background,

383
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,840
why does this intelligence shop even exist

384
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,470
in the capital city?

385
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,590
Doesn't the Investigator's Office know about it?

386
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,710
It ought to know it.

387
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,640
Then why hasn't it been closed down?

388
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
I haven't thought about that.

389
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,400
Could this shop

390
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,950
be run by the Investigator's Office?

391
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,470
Another possibility is that

392
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,590
the owner of this shop is too powerful

393
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,590
for the Investigator's Office to govern.

394
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,280
Not likely.

395
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,880
You probably don't know

396
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,640
how powerful

397
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,310
the Investigator's Office is.

398
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,190
Ever since I came to the capital city,

399
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,830
the follower of the Crown Prince provoked troubles,

400
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,470
Prince Jing's son invited me to the poetry gathering,

401
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,430
and the truth of the assassination becomes abundantly clear.

402
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,070
All these matters came one after another

403
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,830
as if they were all controlled

404
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,000
by a large hand from the behind

405
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,310
which put me in the teeth of the storm.

406
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,590
Your Majesty,

407
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,760
Fan Xian returned.

408
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,470
I'm afraid he is suspicious now.

409
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,000
That doesn't matter.

410
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,520
It's a great pity for the shop.

411
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,830
The shop?

412
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,070
That's a shelter

413
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,680
to the outlaws

414
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,760
given by Chen Pingping.

415
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,950
We can build another one.

416
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,760
We let Fan Xian know

417
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,190
the connection between Xu Yunzhang

418
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,070
and the Eastern Palace in such a simple way.

419
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,830
Isn't that a bit too direct?

420
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
The identity changes so drastically.

421
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I guess Fan Xian will be deadly scared.

422
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,110
If that's the case,

423
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,830
he can't take up the position

424
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,400
to manage Neiku.

425
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,680
The harsh suffering

426
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,280
is a test to him.

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,160
Who do you think will win?

428
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,430
This is a large assembly of talents.

429
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,110
Very hard to tell!

430
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,950
That's right!

431
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,710
-Where is he? -Wait!

432
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,920
What a surprise! So many people!

433
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,560
Of course. The Prince's son is the organizer.

434
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,000
Where is His Highness?

435
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,800
Please wait patiently, Mr. Guo.

436
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,280
His Highness should arrive in no time.

437
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,620
=Li Hongcheng, son of Prince Jing of Nanqing=

438
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,280
Your Highness!

439
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,110
Ruoruo!

440
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,000
Isn't your brother coming?

441
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,310
He...

442
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,280
He said

443
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,190
he needed to get changed half way.

444
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
He prepared these particularly for you.

445
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,000
Excuse me please!

446
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm late.

447
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,950
Got the idea to get changed half way.

448
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,830
As it's my first time to visit,

449
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,040
I prepared a few gifts for you.

450
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,190
This is glazed fruit.

451
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,800
This is cane sugar.

452
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,280
This...

453
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,160
is some sort of seasoning which I don't know.

454
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,880
You gotta try it yourself.

455
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,430
And I bought two bags of persimmons for you

456
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,350
on my way here.

457
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,160
You are the Prince's son. And this is persimmon.
(Prince's son and persimmon have the same pronunciation in Chinese)

458
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,880
It's some sort of luck.

459
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,230
Is everybody here?

460
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,710
Yes.

461
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,280
You're the only one left.

462
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,400
How about the ladies?

463
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,680
Hurry up then. Let's get in.

464
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,740
=Prince Jing's mansion.=

465
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,040
Persimmon?

466
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Brother, so this is the dress

467
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,710
you changed into?

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,160
It's so Danzhou!

469
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,880
What's wrong with Danzhou? Do you think I'm uncool?

470
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,800
I wore this

471
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,830
on the day

472
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,000
I met Lady Drumstick.

473
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,520
I'm afraid she is unable to recognize me if I change this.

474
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,920
Brother,

475
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,310
all the ladies are on that side

476
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,110
for today.

477
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,350
I'll need to join them as well.

478
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,590
How about me?

479
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,800
Who can stand out from the poetry gathering this time?

480
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,310
Who knows!

481
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,000
A lot of scholars want to make a great coup with it.

482
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,070
They are all here today.

483
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,280
It's the first time to have such a grand scene.

484
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,430
It's such a great honor

485
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,430
to be part of a poetry gathering like this.

486
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,800
What a bliss!

487
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,950
You really came here.

488
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,350
Aren't you afraid to lose face?

489
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,710
Now that you have come, shall we...

490
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,880
Do you think you can hide

491
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,800
by turning a deaf ear?

492
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,310
What a jerk!

493
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,800
What a scene!

494
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
A man breaks in.

495
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
How impolite he is!

496
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
He is so rude!

497
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,800
She is not there!

498
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,470
Men live in this world based on rites.

499
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,190
A gentleman can have no fancy clothes

500
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,520
but cannot do without rites.

501
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,400
Who are you?

502
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm He Zongwei.

503
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,160
We've met yesterday

504
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,040
at Yishi House.

505
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,590
Are all the ladies here?

506
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,400
Is there anyone else coming?

507
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,560
Fan Xian,

508
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,590
why are you so rude?

509
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,680
Calm down, gentlemen!

510
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,830
Since this is a poetry gathering,

511
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,950
we'd better make friends by composing poems.

512
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,470
Your Highness,

513
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,680
do you know a lady

514
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,070
who likes to hold a drumstick?

515
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,760
What...

516
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,680
is it again?

517
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,920
Drumstick!

518
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,680
Namely, the leg of chicken.

519
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,470
We will prepare that during lunch.

520
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,520
Take your seats please.

521
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,430
Your Highness is right.

522
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
As this is a competition among scholars,

523
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,830
of course, we should do it by composing poems.

524
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,830
What's the point to compete with that?

525
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,070
You will lose for sure!

526
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,710
How arrogant you are!

527
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,800
Fan Xian,

528
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,000
if you don't dare to compete with me,

529
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,230
just kneel in front of me as an apology.

530
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,880
You will be forgiven.

531
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,590
As I said,

532
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,950
you will lose for sure.

533
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
That's ridiculous!

534
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,350
Who do you think you are?

535
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,110
A great master of poem?

536
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,590
Alright! Tell me how do we do it.

537
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,110
One!

538
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,760
Two!

539
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,920
Three!

540
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,950
Four!

541
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,040
Five!

542
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,160
Six!

543
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,000
Seven!

544
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,950
Eight!

545
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,000
Nine!

546
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,110
Ten!

547
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,350
Your Highness,

548
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,830
take ten steps till here.

549
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,350
The poem must be completed

550
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,400
and read out loud

551
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,350
so that everyone present can evaluate who wins.

552
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,160
Do you agree?

553
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,040
Fantastic!

554
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,040
Red Mansions is indeed awesome.

555
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,710
It's a sufficient lifetime comfort

556
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,110
to read such a marvelous book.

557
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,800
Report it here!

558
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,710
His Highness asked me to report.

559
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,800
For the poem contest,

560
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,760
Guo Baokun proposed to compose a poem within ten steps.

561
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,400
Before the dusk comes,

562
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,230
all poems will be considered together.

563
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,350
Did Fan Xian agree with it?

564
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,640
Fan Xian refused it.

565
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,110
He said no matter how many poems

566
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,590
Guo Baokun and He Zongwei compose,

567
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,760
he will win it with just one.

568
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,950
That's very arrogant!

569
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,880
Good!

570
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,040
One poem is enough to win it?!

571
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,920
Mr. Fan,

572
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,680
do you think Mr. Guo and I

573
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,430
are so untenable?

574
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,880
Countryside man like you

575
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,560
can probably only compose one poem.

576
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,590
After you!

577
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,400
I feel a strong urge to write poetry

578
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,880
and express my feelings at the moment.

579
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,800
Please excuse me.

580
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,160
At the tower, I stand in the mist;

581
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,470
A boat on the river forms a picturesque view.

582
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,590
A wide expanse of mist-covered waters shields the sky;

583
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,590
A scholar writes articles in the dim light.

584
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,830
Well done!

585
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,430
That's really a good poem.

586
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,950
Good point with the last line.

587
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,560
Quite a good poem that is!

588
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,000
The falling tone and rising tone don't match.

589
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,830
Let's keep that aside first.

590
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,190
The poem is full of fancy words

591
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,560
which shows no sign of thinking.

592
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,230
You...

593
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,430
Mr. Guo!

594
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,800
Mr. Fan,

595
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,400
It may have some flaws,

596
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,680
but composing a poem in such
a short while is already not easy.

597
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,000
Since you want to see some sign of thinking,

598
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,800
at the time when I left home

599
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,800
for the capital city

600
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,520
with a whole lot of dreams,

601
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,590
I also composed a poem.

602
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,950
Simple and crude it might be,

603
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,560
it has the thoughts from inside my heart.

604
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
Just read it out if you want!

605
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,230
Your Highness,

606
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,310
-May I? -Please!

607
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,350
Excuse me!

608
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,800
I look towards the east skyline, far and remote;

609
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,190
I start up a journey in white, on a frosted road.

610
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,000
Don't say I'd travel alone.

611
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,470
The green hills will see me off in the glow.

612
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,710
Good! Good! Good!

613
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,070
There was a bit of arrogance

614
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,350
when it was composed.

615
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,560
Did you ever predict

616
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,400
you would end up as a follower

617
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,830
licking others' boots?

618
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,710
That's really mean.

619
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,710
Are you able

620
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,160
to compose any really good poems?

621
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,830
Here it goes!

622
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,830
That's unbelievable!

623
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,000
Look! It's his turn now.

624
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,710
Mr. Fan,

625
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
one poem in ten steps.

626
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,070
Don't you need to reconsider it?

627
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,040
I didn't find the person I wanted to see.

628
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,760
So I'm not in a good mood.

629
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,830
I'll just write it directly.

630
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,280
Gentlemen, let's make a bet.

631
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,710
After I write down my poem,

632
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,680
I'll stop composing poem for my whole life

633
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,230
if you can come up with better ones.

634
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,430
If I lose,

635
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,070
I'll never compose poems any more.

636
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,280
It's not poems that you're composing.

637
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,040
It's trouble.

638
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,590
The wind so swift, the sky so wide, apes wail and cry;

639
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:49,110
Water so clear and beach so white, birds wheel and fly.

640
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,040
The boundless forest sheds its leaves shower by shower;

641
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,000
The endless river rolls its waves hour after hour.

642
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,640
Good poem!

643
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,760
A thousand miles from home, I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

644
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,110
I'll now and then for years, alone I'm on this height.

645
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,950
Living in times so hard, at frosted hair I pine;

646
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,470
Cast down by poverty,

647
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,680
I have to give up wine.

648
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,000
A thousand miles, autumn's plight, years of illness...

649
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,400
A few lines of words depict the
millennium sorrow so thoroughly.

650
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,000
This poem from today's poetry gathering

651
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,830
will be remembered by history.

652
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,430
I'm done!

653
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,560
It's your turn.

654
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,000
Take your time.

655
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,230
Make it as long as it needs to be.

656
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,880
As long as it can be better than this one,

657
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,880
you win.

658
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,710
That's Du Fu's work.

659
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
The poem named On the Height

660
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,920
is considered to be the best Lüshi.

661
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,880
Don't you ever try to compose poems for the rest of your life.

662
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,280
Where is the toilet?

663
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,800
In the backyard.

664
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,470
Which way?

665
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,830
This way!

666
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,160
Take care of my sister.

667
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,760
It's amazing!

668
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,560
Just awesome!

669
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,680
Forgive me, Saint of Poem!

670
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,880
I'm sorry.

671
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,800
But they are really too arrogant.

672
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,400
I have to teach them a lesson with your poem.

673
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,280
Mr. Fan!

674
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,680
You're indeed outstanding in literature.

675
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,640
But scholars need mental cultivation.

676
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,000
You don't have to

677
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,590
look down on scholars in the world.

678
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,230
If you can calm down and focus on self-cultivation,

679
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,880
you're bound to become

680
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,800
a master of words.

681
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,230
Guo Baokun is shameless.

682
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're even worse.

683
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,230
When Guo Baokun humiliates others,

684
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,350
you repeat with him aside.

685
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,230
When he aggressively proposed for a poem contest,

686
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,400
why didn't you ask him for self-cultivation?!

687
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,800
As you have lost the contest,

688
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,590
you require me to maintain self-cultivation

689
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,590
and make concession.

690
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,760
Scholar He,

691
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,160
don't you feel ashamed?

692
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,360
Let him in.

693
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,020
=Xie Bi'an, the bodyguard of the Second Prince.=

694
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,840
Why would I get in?

695
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,320
Then go back!

696
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,020
=The Second Prince of Nanqing, Li Chengze.=

697
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,190
Fan Xian!

698
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,910
You know me?

699
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,150
The Crown Prince takes you as enemy.

700
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,840
Of course, I need to remember your name.

701
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,800
What are you?

702
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,840
You have three chances to make a guess.

703
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,080
The Second Prince!

704
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,910
Smart!

705
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,360
Is there anything I can help you?

706
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,520
The Crown Prince and I got estranged

707
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,670
and you're a person he doesn't like.

708
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,560
You want to draw me over to your side?

709
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,560
I will kill you

710
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,360
and present your body

711
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,470
to him as a gift

712
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,800
so that we can be reconciled like before.

713
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,630
If so, you might need to consider

714
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,120
if his sword is faster

715
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,280
than my hand reaching out to you.

716
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,600
Looks like the sword is faster.

717
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,710
Anyone else who has poems?

718
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,120
Your Highness!

719
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,910
Please!

720
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,430
The poem from Mr. Fan

721
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,630
is indeed extraordinary.

722
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,840
However...

723
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,670
his hand-writing is a bit inferior.

724
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,190
Is that right?

725
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,150
Yeah, it's true.

726
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,910
It's awfully written

727
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,120
by its look.

728
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,870
Awful!

729
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,840
The contest is meant to about the poem not hand-writing.

730
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
My brother has made his point clear.

731
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,320
Just keep writing whatever you want.

732
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,430
This is the only poem he will compete with.

733
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,760
The writing is too ugly.

734
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,150
So, you don't want to write?

735
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,040
If you lose,

736
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,670
you're forbidden to compose poem for the rest of your life.

737
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,040
As a scholar graduated from famous school

738
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,040
and the Imperial Compiler in palace,

739
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,840
you will keep your word, won't you?

740
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Of course.

741
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,320
Do you need me

742
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,000
to have the paper and brush delivered to you?

743
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,320
Young Master,

744
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,190
these are for you.

745
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
Superior Langhao brush!

746
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,190
Young Master!

747
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,360
Piss off!

748
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,000
What a follower!

749
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,560
Young Master!

750
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,390
-Piss off now! -Young Master!

751
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,360
Whose side are you on?

752
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,120
Don't you understand what she means?

753
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,910
Why do you take her orders?

754
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,000
-Young Master! -Go away!

755
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,800
Get disappeared!

756
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
You're obnoxious!

757
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,390
So sweet!

758
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,320
You'll be dead with a simple click of my tongue.

759
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,080
Your Highness won't let that happen.

760
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,760
Why not? As I said,

761
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,320
I can reconcile with Crown Prince

762
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,910
with your head.

763
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,600
Your Highness and the Crown Prince can't reconcile

764
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,800
with a thousand heads of Fan Xian.

765
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,520
How dare you!

766
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,390
Any other reasons?

767
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,190
If Your Highness really want to kill me,

768
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,520
this will not be the place,

769
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,470
nor by this means.

770
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,320
This is so unwise.

771
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,840
Bi'an,

772
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,470
retrieve your sword.

773
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,390
Your poem is very good!

774
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,390
I wanted to meet you as soon as I read it.

775
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,560
I don't want to meet you.

776
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,470
If I had known that you're here,

777
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,760
I would not have walked this way.

778
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,670
Why?

779
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,670
The Crown Prince must think

780
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,630
I have come under your service

781
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,670
once he knows

782
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,280
I have met Your Highness.

783
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
My days to come

784
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,390
will be difficult.

785
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,560
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

786
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,080
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

787
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,190
Your Majesty!

788
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,080
Mr. Fan has composed

789
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,320
an unprecedentedly good poem.

790
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,320
Read it!

791
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,470
Yes!

792
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,600
The wind so swift, the sky so wide, apes wail and cry;

793
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,280
Water so clear and beach so white, birds wheel and fly.

794
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,800
The boundless forest sheds its leaves shower by shower;

795
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,230
The endless river rolls its waves hour after hour.

796
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,040
A thousand miles from home, I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

797
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,000
I'll now and then for years, alone I'm on this height.

798
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,670
Living in times so hard, at frosted hair I pine;

799
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,320
Cast down by poverty, I have to give up wine.

800
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,670
It's just a bit too gloomy.

801
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,120
After writing it down,

802
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,710
Mr. Fan went to the backyard and met the Second Prince.

803
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,080
I couldn't approach

804
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,870
because the Second Prince has a swordsman with him.

805
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,150
I was unable to hear

806
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,800
what they talked about.

807
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,390
Where is the Crown Prince?

808
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,950
He is meeting Princess Royal

809
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,950
at the Guangxin Palace.

810
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,040
How attentive he is!

811
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,950
Give the poem to him.

812
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,670
Yes!

813
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,840
Your Majesty,

814
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,600
do you have anything else to deliver?

815
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,000
Ask him to read the poem carefully

816
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,150
and tell him the story

817
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,360
happened at the Prince Jing's mansion.

818
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,080
Yes!

819
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,190
I'll now and then for years, alone I'm on this height.

820
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,120
Living in times so hard, at frosted hair I pine;

821
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,080
Cast down by poverty, I have to give up wine.

822
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,560
Guo Baokun loses badly.

823
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,000
His Majesty sends this.

824
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,000
It's said to be composed by Fan Xian.

825
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,430
He requires you to read it.

826
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,120
Smart!

827
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,150
You have not only the talent as a scholar

828
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,870
but also the wisdom as a worldly person.

829
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,910
That is rare.

830
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,840
Thank you very much, Your Highness!

831
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,710
The Crown Prince will know about

832
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,560
us meeting each other sooner or later.

833
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,800
Aren't you worried about that?

834
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,150
Your Highness, do you know any girl

835
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,230
who likes to eat drumsticks?

836
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,950
Do you believe love at first sight?

837
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,760
I didn't either,

838
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,320
but I do now.

839
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,670
I met a girl

840
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,190
who had a drumstick in her hand.

841
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,870
I want to share the story

842
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,000
with you.

843
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,870
Are you interested?

844
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,900
In the river of history,

845
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,100
time goes round and round.

846
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,460
Memories about the former and present lives

847
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,340
join each other in an endless way.

848
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,940
In the long drunken Milky Way,

849
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,660
one season follows another in a flash,

850
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,860
and the wild geese are flying south.

851
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,780
I just can't give up

852
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,780
to be with you for my whole life.

853
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,060
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

854
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,860
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

855
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,740
Year after year in the wandering,

856
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,300
I count the remaining years.

857
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,500
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

858
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,060
even though we have ended up the destiny,

859
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,740
I never feel regretful.

860
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,700
In such a chaotic world,

861
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,460
I still miss you as ever.

862
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,100
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

863
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,820
With a gentle heart,

864
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,380
I cherish our remaining years.

865
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,220
Even though we have to go through

866
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,180
all the hardships along the journey,

867
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:35,500
you always stay by my side,

868
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,260
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

869
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,180
Year after year in the wandering,

870
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,540
I count the remaining years.

871
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,900
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

872
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,700
even though we end up the destiny,

873
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,140
I never feel regretful.

874
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,060
In such a chaotic world,

875
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,020
I still miss you as ever.

876
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,700
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

877
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,460
With a gentle heart,

878
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,860
I cherish our remaining years.

879
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,660
Even though we have to go through

880
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,820
all the hardships along the journey,

881
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:16,100
you always stay by my side...
