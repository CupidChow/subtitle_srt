1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 26

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,510
Dad, you want to see me.

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,080
You're back.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,270
Come and take a seat.

19
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,720
The negotiation

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,830
in Court of State Ceremonials is over.

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,550
Be cautious at the Hall tomorrow.

22
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,310
You mean

23
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,230
the banquet tomorrow night?

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,230
What's wrong?

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,310
It's known to the world that

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,630
literary giants are all in Beiqi.

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,830
In earlier years,

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,320
scholars actually found it an honor

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,110
to pass the imperial examinations in Beiqi.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,190
Though things are better these years,

31
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,880
when it comes to scholars,

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Nanqing is no match to Beiqi.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,110
Now the Nanqing literary circles

34
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,800
have anchored their hopes on you.

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,440
Me?

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
The literary circles?

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,030
That poem with the line

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,240
“A thousand miles from home, I'm grieved at
autumn's plight” which you wrote a few days ago

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,630
is rated as the No.1 Current Seven-character Poem

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,080
by scholars of Nanqing.

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,110
Many say in private that

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,880
accomplished at such a young age,

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,190
you can be better than Zhuang Mohan in future.

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,750
I just wrote one poem.

45
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,830
They are too hasty in drawing the conclusion.

46
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,030
One poem is not much,

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,720
but we've longed for a talented scholar

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,520
for so long.

49
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,390
We may even fight a losing battle.

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,880
Who will lose?

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,800
You, of course.

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
So tomorrow night,

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,830
everyone will watch me

54
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,030
meeting the literary giant

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,320
Zhuang Mohan.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,800
You don't need to be amazing.

57
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,670
Just play it safe.

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,800
That's enough.

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,670
Will you go tomorrow night?

60
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,960
The banquet tomorrow

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,160
is especially set for Court of State Ceremonials

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
and Board of Rites.

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,270
I'm the Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,550
Why would I go?

65
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,440
Don't worry.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,960
Just a little advice.

67
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,830
Respected as Zhuang Mohan is,

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,630
why would he actually make things difficult

69
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,440
for a young man like you?

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,880
Fan Xian will also attend the banquet tomorrow night.

71
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,550
Master Zhuang, please ruin his name.

72
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,830
You've hung up a red lantern.

73
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,920
Uncle, for all these years,

74
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,600
I've been wondering

75
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,480
whether you can see or not.

76
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,720
How come you know

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,350
I hang up a lantern?

78
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,440
And you even know the color.

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
It's hard for me to explain.

80
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,790
I can know everything.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,720
But I don't see with eyes.

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
You see with your heart.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,270
I don't know how to put it.

84
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,790
Uncle.

85
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,720
I find you mysterious all the time.

86
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,950
If anyone dares to piss you off,

87
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,830
he's definitely dice with death.

88
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,790
Take a seat. Take a seat. Take a seat.

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,720
Let's get down to business.

90
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,110
Tomorrow night,

91
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,950
the imperial family will hold a banquet at
the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

92
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,040
The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest?

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,200
How is Wang Qinian involved?
(Qinian sounds like Prayer for Good Harvest in Chinese)

94
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,200
Who?

95
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,270
Wang Qinian.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,880
Uncle,

97
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,480
besides being mysterious,

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,550
how come your thoughts

99
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,390
are so hard to follow recently?

100
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,110
Thoughts?

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,920
I don't think the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
has anything to do with Wang Qinian.

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,830
Fine.

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,070
Let's get down to business.

105
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,000
The banquet tomorrow is mainly for

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
the celebration of finishing the war against Beiqi.

107
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,350
It's kind of a big event.

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,640
Aren't you going to ask me

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,000
why I ask you over?

110
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,670
Aren't you going to tell me if I don't ask?

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,000
You've made a point.

112
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,270
Fine.

113
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,640
After the banquet tomorrow night,

114
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,000
we'll break into the imperial harem.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,880
Are you sure?

116
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Everyone will relax

117
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,600
after a great event.

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,830
OK, the plan remains unchanged.

119
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,440
I will lure away Hong Sixiang,

120
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,000
and you should sneak into the Empress Dowager's palace

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,760
to find the key.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
There's one last problem.

123
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,230
I don't know

124
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,510
where the Empress Dowager keeps the key.

125
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,920
It might take time to find it.

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,830
There's a secret compartment

127
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,110
on the bed board under her pillow.

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,720
All her important things are kept there.

129
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,230
How do you know that?

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,440
Your mom searched it before.

131
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,760
Why did my mom

132
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,720
search her secret compartment?

133
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,720
The old lady has lived in widowhood for so many years.

134
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,440
Though she looks serious,

135
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,880
I wonder whether she keeps

136
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,640
love letters in private or not.

137
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,880
Those are the words said by your mom back then.

138
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,880
So she searched the Empress Dowager's

139
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,230
secret compartment only for gossiping!

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
I've no idea

141
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,950
what gossiping implies,

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,160
but yes, you're right.

143
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Didn't she get caught?

144
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,830
I kept watch for her.

145
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,110
Why are you laughing?

146
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,350
Words can't express

147
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,880
my feelings right now.

148
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
What feelings?

149
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,390
Just forget it.

150
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,950
Anyway, back then,

151
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,720
my mom had solved

152
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,640
the biggest problem for me.

153
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,640
Now,

154
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,920
as long as I know where the key is,

155
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,550
I feel quite sure of getting it out.

156
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,480
If we take the key,

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,270
the old lady might notice.

158
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,670
We'd better put in a fake one.

159
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,390
Without seeing the real key,

160
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,070
how could you make a fake one in advance?

161
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,440
I've got an idea.

162
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,320
Good.

163
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,670
Wait for me here tomorrow night.

164
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,200
Someone's here.

165
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,670
I asked him over.

166
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,510
Seriously?

167
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,510
Your Excellency.

168
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,200
Come in.

169
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,270
It's quite late now.

170
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,510
Do you have anything for me?

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,950
I have a question for you.

172
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,790
Please go ahead.

173
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,960
Do you have anything to do with the
Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest?

174
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,440
I suppose not.

175
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,790
I think so.

176
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,280
What's wrong?

177
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,230
Nothing.

178
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,790
Take a seat.

179
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,320
Your Excellency, thank you.

180
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,520
I might as well stand.

181
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,470
Your Excellency,

182
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,200
I heard that by deterring the Beiqi mission

183
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,760
in the Court of State Ceremonials,

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
you've made great contributions to Nanqing.

185
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,550
=Ten taels of silver=

186
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,550
I will attend the banquet tomorrow night.

187
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,760
Your Excellency, charismatic and vigorous as you are,

188
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,640
you'll definitely be promoted in the near future.

189
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,710
Is this for me?

190
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,400
Yes.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,230
Thank you, Your Excellency.

192
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,440
Your Excellency,

193
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,110
next time you grant me a reward,

194
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,590
please grant me bank notes instead.

195
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
They are easier to hide.

196
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,110
I want to break into the imperial harem at night.

197
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,710
Your Excellency,

198
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,790
pardon, please?

199
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,960
I said I want to break into the imperial harem at night

200
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
and sneak into the Empress Dowager's palace

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,710
to steal a key.

202
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,000
Of course,

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
for fear the old lady might notice,

204
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,200
I have to make a fake key overnight

205
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,840
to replace the real one.

206
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,030
That's my plan.

207
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,590
Are you kidding me?

208
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,350
Not really.

209
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,470
Are you serious?

210
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,470
Yes.

211
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,670
It's a deadly sin which could implicate your family.

212
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,670
I suppose it is.

213
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,110
Then why do you

214
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,520
tell me about it?

215
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,790
I just told you

216
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I have to make a fake key

217
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,280
overnight.

218
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,760
I have to find the best locksmith in the capital city.

219
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,350
Since I'm not familiar with the capital city,

220
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,640
I need someone with connections.

221
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,840
That's you.

222
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,030
If I'm involved,

223
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,320
I will also commit a deadly sin.

224
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,710
You just find me a locksmith

225
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,640
to make a key.

226
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,790
You know nothing else.

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,880
Right!

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,350
Then you should only ask me

229
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,110
to find a locksmith.

230
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,590
Right? Why tell me

231
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,350
the whole plan?

232
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,790
I also want to tell you less,

233
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,350
but I can't.

234
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
You have to wait for me

235
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,110
outside the imperial palace tomorrow.

236
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,030
Your Excellency!

237
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,470
Aren't you afraid that I might tell on you?

238
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,840
Do you really want to

239
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,200
trust me

240
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,230
with your life?

241
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,640
Of course I do.

242
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,440
You're a wise man.

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,110
You should know that

244
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,440
you only need to take a little risk by helping me,

245
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,030
but you'll get yourself killed if you dare betray me.

246
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,440
What do you mean?

247
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,150
You know how Chen Pingping

248
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,000
treats me.

249
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,320
The Head treats you like his son.

250
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,520
So this is the case.

251
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,670
If I tell on you

252
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,760
and get you killed,

253
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,840
the Head will definitely

254
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,590
cut me into pieces.

255
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,150
You're really wise.

256
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
Then why don't you ask the Head

257
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
to do you the favor.

258
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,150
It's inconvenient for big potatoes

259
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,230
to do such things.

260
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,230
What can I say?

261
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,030
The choice is yours.

262
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,550
I know a good locksmith.

263
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,080
Good. Ask him to wait for me tomorrow night.

264
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,280
OK.

265
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,670
From tonight on,

266
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,400
I'll raise your salary by another ten taels of silver.

267
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,840
This is something that might get my entire family killed.

268
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
You only add ten taels of silver?!

269
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't you think it's too little?

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,590
So you don't want it?

271
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,590
I want it.

272
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,590
Give me bank notes instead next time.

273
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,230
What time is it now?

274
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,280
It's about 1:00 p.m.

275
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,960
Is the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest ready?

276
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Yes, they started decorating

277
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,320
early this morning.

278
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,030
Find me a place for the night banquet.

279
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,790
It's only held for Court of State Ceremonials

280
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,880
and Board of Rites.

281
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,320
It's no big deal.

282
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,670
Just do it.

283
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,470
Yes.

284
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,200
I can't wait.

285
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,590
I've asked.

286
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
As to the night banquet in the
Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest,

287
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,200
guests can take seats at about 5:00 p.m.

288
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,000
Your Highness, if you eat too much now,

289
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,840
you won't feel like eating

290
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,080
in the banquet.

291
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,230
On such banquets,

292
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,670
there will be a lot of drinking and praises.

293
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,710
How could I fill my belly?

294
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,520
That's right.

295
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,670
Such banquets

296
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
are merely a formality.

297
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,760
Your Highness really don't

298
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,590
have to go.

299
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,710
Fan Xian completed his first task successfully.

300
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,520
I certainly should

301
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,760
congratulate him in person.

302
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Hasn't Fan Xian taken the side of

303
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,710
the Crown Prince?

304
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,230
Who told you so?

305
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,910
If not, why would the Crown Prince

306
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,790
send him to negotiate with the Beiqi mission?

307
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,520
Man like Fan Xian

308
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,790
won't follow the Crown Prince willingly.

309
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,790
I've only met Fan Xian a few times,

310
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,710
but I find him a bosom friend.

311
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,440
Just like me, Fan Xian won't feel content

312
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,880
to occupy a position below others.

313
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,200
How long has His Highness stood there?

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,150
About an hour.

315
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,150
His Highness is afraid to form folds on his gown.

316
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,790
What time is it now?

317
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,760
Your Highness, it's about 5:00 p.m.

318
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,910
Let's go to the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

319
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,150
Yes.

320
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,880
Master Zhuang, the carriage is ready.

321
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,760
We're ready to go.

322
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,350
Let me take this for you.

323
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,960
Your Excellency, I've talked with the locksmith.

324
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,110
Good. Let's go drinking.

325
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,230
Your Excellency Fan!

326
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,760
Your Excellency Fan!

327
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,550
Your Excellency Xin!

328
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,440
What a coincidence!

329
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,230
Indeed!

330
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,080
Your Excellency Fan,

331
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
why not wear your robe?

332
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,880
It's just a meal.

333
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,230
I'm not some high-ranking official.

334
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,350
Well then. I'll have

335
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,550
more drinks with you later.

336
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
Your Excellencies, regular examination.

337
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,550
No edged tools

338
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,880
can be taken inside.

339
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,110
Who would bring edged tools to a banquet?

340
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,840
Your Excellency Fan, listen!

341
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,350
The ritual music

342
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,760
is prepared by the Board of Rites.

343
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,440
Can I bring needles in?

344
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,110
Steel needles. About this long.

345
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
No.

346
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,110
Wait a moment.

347
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,440
That's all.

348
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,000
Your Excellency Xin, let's get inside.

349
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm cautious because I was assassinated before.

350
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,280
Yes, you should be.

351
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,470
It's right to be cautious.

352
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
Can I bring in poisons?

353
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Poisons?

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,110
No! No! No!

355
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,640
Fan Xian.

356
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,590
Your Highness.

357
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,960
What's going on?

358
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,230
Don't touch it.

359
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,440
These are poisons made by myself.

360
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm not allowed to bring them inside.

361
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
You're really Fei Jie's student.

362
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,470
Can they kill?

363
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,200
Of course.

364
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,230
Give me a bag.

365
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,840
No.

366
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,670
Why?

367
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,200
If anything happens to His Majesty

368
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,880
and the Crown Prince,

369
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
I won't be able to justify myself.

370
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,710
Right. Just forget it.

371
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,190
Fan Xian, you've rendered meritorious services this time.

372
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,310
You'll definitely have a bright future. Congratulations!

373
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

374
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,830
We can see each other more.

375
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,830
I might be able to help in the imperial court.

376
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,760
I'm so flattered.

377
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,110
Your Highness.

378
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,280
You're from Court of State
Ceremonials. Your name is Wang...

379
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,280
Xin!

380
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,160
Xin... Xin... Xin...

381
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,640
Xin Qiwu.

382
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,430
I remember you're a follower of the Crown Prince.

383
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,470
We're all couriers! We're all couriers!

384
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,110
If you feel dissatisfied

385
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,040
following the Crown Prince,

386
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,400
you can follow me instead.

387
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,760
There should be none left.

388
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,560
Now there's none left.

389
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,760
Don't touch them.

390
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't have the antidotes

391
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,350
for some poisons.

392
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,190
Your Excellency Xin.

393
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,160
What are you thinking?

394
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,110
In your opinion,

395
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,680
why does the Second Prince come to the banquet?

396
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,040
To draw talents like Your Excellency Xin

397
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,190
over to his side

398
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,520
of course.

399
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,160
Your Excellency Fan, you're making fun of me again.

400
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,190
It's obvious that the Second
Prince was trying to win you over.

401
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,590
How could it be me?

402
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,160
Your Highness! Please believe me!

403
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,590
I'm definitely loyal

404
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,830
to Your Highness.

405
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,640
I will never follow others.

406
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,230
Your Highness!

407
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,760
Your Highness, I can prove that.

408
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,920
Just now, the Second Prince

409
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,110
did try to win him over,

410
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,830
but loyal as His Excellency Xin is,

411
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,920
he didn't take the offer.

412
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,800
Right! Right! Right!

413
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,640
Your Excellency Fan, thank you for telling the truth.

414
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,760
You're welcome.

415
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,590
Don't worry. His Highness is open-minded.

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,880
Yes! Yes! Yes!

417
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,920
Your Excellency Fan, something's not right.

418
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,040
The Second Prince actually

419
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,640
said those words to win you over.

420
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,470
How come you become the one

421
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,110
to clear my name instead?

422
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,350
It's the same.

423
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,310
Your Excellency, it's not!

424
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,880
The Princess Royal is also here.

425
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,230
=Guo Baokun, son of Guo Youzhi,
Minister of the Board of Rites=

426
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,380
Brat, do you dare
=Guo Baokun, son of Guo Youzhi,
Minister of the Board of Rites=

427
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:38,680
Brat, do you dare

428
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
to see me?

429
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,190
Who are you?

430
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,830
Unbelievable!

431
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,590
You're the one who beat me on the street.

432
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,760
Now you actually pretend

433
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,710
you don't know me!

434
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,000
Young Master Guo.

435
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,000
Long time no see!

436
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Your wounds are almost healed.

437
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,880
Good for you.

438
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,400
How dare you forget me!

439
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,590
Mind your words! Mind your words!

440
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,110
You sound like a whining woman.

441
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,520
You villain!

442
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll never forget

443
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,400
what you've done!

444
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,680
You sound more like it.

445
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,760
Why are you here? Why is he here?

446
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,560
He. He. He.

447
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,830
I am the Imperial Compiler.

448
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,310
My father is the Minister of the Board of Rites.

449
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,350
Why can't I be here?

450
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,040
You can! You can!

451
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,830
The dishes will be served soon.

452
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,310
-Mr. Guo, please take your seat. -Don't be smug.

453
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,110
Fan Xian, let me tell you.

454
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,920
Today, right here,

455
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll watch you hit rock bottom

456
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,950
and ruin your name

457
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,590
with my own eyes.

458
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,520
Nonsense!

459
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,310
Father.

460
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
What's the occasion?

461
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,950
Go back to your seat!

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,590
Yes.

463
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,700
=Guo Youzhi, Minister of the Board of Rites=

464
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,560
My son is so rude.

465
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,110
Your Excellency Fan, please forgive him.

466
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,190
Who are you?

467
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,590
This is Guo Youzhi,

468
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,760
Minister of the Board of Rites.

469
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,000
Minister, it's you.

470
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,350
Your Excellency, don't worry.

471
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,040
Your son is mischievous and lovely.

472
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,350
I'm not angry at all.

473
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,950
Well. Well. Well.

474
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,560
Come on! OK! OK!

475
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,800
Stop looking around.

476
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,830
Our seats are over there.

477
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,560
Come on! This way, please!

478
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,710
Let's sit here.

479
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,280
Come on! Have a seat!

480
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,950
Have a seat!

481
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,470
Have a seat!

482
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,160
Your Excellency Fan, have a seat!

483
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,430
Your Excellency Fan,

484
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,280
Guo Baokun is also a follower of the Crown Prince.

485
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,000
You'd better make peace.

486
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,920
I'm fine with that.

487
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Just look at him.

488
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,560
Your problem will be solved gradually.

489
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,190
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

490
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,430
Did you really beat him?

491
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,070
How could that be?

492
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,350
By reading the books of sages since childhood,

493
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,560
I've always been denying self and returning to propriety.

494
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,800
How could I beat others?

495
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,560
But you killed a martial arts master

496
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,110
from Beiqi on the street a few days ago.

497
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,800
Nice wine.

498
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,000
Right. Right. Nice. Nice.

499
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,400
Xin,

500
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,760
there are two seats left.

501
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,880
For whom?

502
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,110
Probably for the two masters

503
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,350
from Dongyi Town and Beiqi.

504
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,230
Beiqi has sent the literary giant Zhuang Mohan.

505
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,830
Who has Dongyi Town sent?

506
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,590
As for Dongyi Town...

507
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,620
=Yun Zhilan, first apprentice of Great Master Si Gujian=

508
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,920
Your Excellency Fan! Your Excellency Fan!

509
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,310
Are you OK?

510
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,310
How can he carry a sword into the imperial palace?

511
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,470
Apprentices of Si Gujian

512
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,470
never leave their swords behind.

513
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,950
His Majesty has made an exception for them.

514
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,000
Apprentice of Si Gujian?

515
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,680
He's the first apprentice of

516
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,110
Great Master Si Gujian,

517
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,350
whose name is Yun Zhilan.

518
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,470
Yun Zhilan?

519
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,680
Those two female assassins

520
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,280
you killed on the street

521
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
were his apprentices.

522
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,280
The Dongyi Town mission

523
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,590
is also sent here to settle that.

524
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,590
Does he sell wine?

525
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,950
I've never heard of that.

526
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,830
Your Excellency, why do you ask?

527
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,400
It sounds like a wine's name.

528
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,430
Really?

529
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,470
Your Excellency Fan,

530
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,400
the Princess Royal asks you over

531
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,520
to tell you something.

532
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,310
Come closer.

533
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,800
These days,

534
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,830
I've been waiting for you to kill me.

535
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,880
How come there are no surprises?

536
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,680
Your Highness, take it easy.

537
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,040
You'll be surprised at any time.

538
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,000
If you pledge allegiance to me,

539
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,800
I'll let Wan'er marry you.

540
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,470
I'll let you have the financial power of the Neiku.

541
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,280
And I'll give you more whatever you want.

542
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,110
What if I want to kick you out of

543
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,590
the capital city?

544
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,000
A great wish.

545
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,800
You should definitely try.

546
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,710
I won't fail Your Highness for sure!

547
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,560
Fan Xian and Auntie

548
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,880
are talking happily.

549
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,470
I wonder what they're talking about.

550
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,560
It's none of my business.

551
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,710
Your Highness wants to

552
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,800
win Fan Xian over, right?

553
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,160
Let's make a bet on

554
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,680
who will get Fan Xian in the end.

555
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,590
What shall we bet?

556
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Life.

557
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,470
It seems I've made

558
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,160
an improper joke.

559
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,000
Your Highness, please forgive me!

560
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,280
OK.

561
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,070
Zhuang Mohan is here.

562
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,340
=Zhuang Mohan, Beiqi Litterateur=

563
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,920
You've never met Master Zhuang, right?

564
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,950
It might be fate

565
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,230
for Beiqi to have

566
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,400
such a literary giant.

567
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,160
After explaining classic texts and
annotating articles for decades,

568
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,470
he's got many works to his credit.

569
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,760
In some way,

570
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,230
he's even more powerful than an emperor.

571
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,160
Carrying the literary inheritance all by himself,

572
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,640
doesn't he find it burdensome?

573
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,280
If the scholars heard what you just said,

574
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,400
you would be accused of disrespect of the saint.

575
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,230
Why would I admit

576
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,280
I said those words?

577
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,400
I heard some people

578
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,800
have anchored their hopes on you,

579
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,800
expecting you to become

580
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,070
a literary giant in future.

581
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,400
Your Highness won't hope so for sure!

582
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,160
Well, since Master Zhuang is here,

583
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,880
the banquet should start soon.

584
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,400
Go back to your seat.

585
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,350
I'll excuse myself.

586
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,760
I've given you the chance,

587
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,280
but you've thrown it away.

588
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,520
Here arrives His Majesty!

589
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,520
This way! This way! This way!

590
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,310
May Your Majesty live ten thousand years!

591
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,950
All rise.

592
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,950
Thank you, Your Majesty!

593
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,800
His Majesty has arrived at the
Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

594
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,640
Have you checked

595
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,000
all the maidservants, eunuchs and imperial guards

596
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,760
on shift tonight?

597
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,950
Yes, I have.

598
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,520
All of them have a clean family background.

599
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,640
No one is suspicious.

600
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,680
Among those who entered the Hall,

601
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,310
have you found anyone suspicious?

602
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,190
Yes,

603
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,110
Fan Xian is.

604
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,640
According to the Division of Imperial Guards,

605
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,040
he carried a dagger and poisons with him

606
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,310
when he arrived.

607
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,800
What about Zhuang Mohan?

608
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,000
Zhuang Mohan only took inside

609
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,310
a roll of old paper.

610
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,950
My men took the chance to check it.

611
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,110
There was nothing inside.

612
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
In my opinion,

613
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,350
Zhuang Mohan doesn't practice

614
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,310
martial arts.

615
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,920
He wouldn't be a problem.

616
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,710
Yun Zhilan went inside with his sword.

617
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,640
Right.

618
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,070
But Yun Zhilan is an apprentice of Si Gujian.

619
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,310
He is not supposed to

620
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,160
know Zhuang Mohan.

621
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,280
If Yun Zhilan tries to

622
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,830
kill His Majesty with his sword,

623
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,680
who can stop him?

624
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,000
Eunuch Hong Sixiang is right outside the Hall.

625
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,520
Serve the dishes.

626
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,640
Eunuch Hong, it's a night owl.

627
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,710
Young Master Guo.

628
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,040
Chief Musician Fan.

629
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,520
Your Excellency Fan, His Majesty is calling you.

630
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,640
Calling me?

631
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,350
What does His Majesty call me?

632
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,760
You're the Chief Musician of
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

633
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
That's the name of your official position.

634
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,560
Your Majesty.

635
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,310
You've seen me a few times, but you've never knelt down.

636
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,310
I thought you would remain standing this time.

637
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,640
Then I would piss off everyone.

638
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,000
Look at your blurred eyes.

639
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,190
You must have drunk a lot.

640
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,070
Your Majesty.

641
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,950
On such a big occasion,

642
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,880
I can't help feeling nervous.

643
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,470
Yun Zhilan.

644
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,400
Your two apprentices

645
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,640
were killed by him.

646
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,400
I know.

647
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,190
Young as he is,

648
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,920
he's somewhat competent.

649
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,280
He's competent if he can kill me.

650
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,430
The apprentice of Si Gujian

651
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,760
is really proud.

652
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,710
I get that.

653
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,190
Fan Xian.

654
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,230
According to the memorial submitted
by Court of State Ceremonials,

655
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,880
you've done a great job this time.

656
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,710
The war was started because of you,

657
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,560
and it was ended by you.

658
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,470
I don't want to praise you in public.

659
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,680
Come on! Join me for a drink.

660
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,680
Chief Musician Fan, please wait.

661
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,400
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

662
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,430
Go ahead.

663
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,000
Besides being good at martial arts,

664
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,830
Fan Xian is also famous for literary grace.

665
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,310
I'm amazed by his talents

666
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,310
in writing poems.

667
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,470
Recently, I've heard that

668
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,760
when negotiating with Beiqi,

669
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,400
Fan Xian handled it properly without
being too humble or too pushy.

670
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,310
He can be entrusted with important tasks.

671
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,950
Just go straight to the point.

672
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,680
Why not put Fan Xian in charge of

673
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,920
the imperial examinations next spring?

674
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,110
Scholars going down in history

675
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,830
under the supervision of a youth talent,

676
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,280
it might become a much told tale.

677
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,710
Though Fan Xian is known for his poems,

678
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,670
he is inexperienced after all.

679
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,910
Your Majesty.

680
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,040
Though inexperienced,

681
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,120
he is really talented.

682
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,670
I support the suggestion

683
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,360
to put Fan Xian in charge of the imperial
examinations held in spring.

684
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,390
Well...

685
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,560
How could this be?

686
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,190
There're still a few months
before the imperial examinations.

687
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,630
We'll see by then.

688
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,560
Go back to your seats.

689
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,760
Your Majesty.

690
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,120
Is this young man Fan Xian?

691
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,630
Master Zhuang, have you also heard of him?

692
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
I've read his poem.

693
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,840
Young as he is,

694
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,320
he's talented in poetry.

695
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,710
Master Zhuang, you should guide and
support the younger generation.

696
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,630
I'm a minister from Beiqi.

697
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,000
I should not interfere with the political affairs of Nanqing.

698
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,040
But the imperial examinations held in spring

699
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,520
are of fundamental importance

700
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,950
to scholars around the world.

701
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,870
You should be cautious

702
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,320
when choosing the man in charge.

703
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,230
Master Zhuang, you're absolutely right.

704
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,520
When it comes to the imperial examinations,

705
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,630
we can't be too cautious.

706
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,710
Master Zhuang, I admire you for being
well versed in the learning of

707
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,950
both ancient and modern times,

708
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,760
but I don't agree with what you just said.

709
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
Though I'm a woman

710
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,870
with little knowledge,

711
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,710
I've read the seven-character poem written by Fan Xian.

712
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,600
He's young indeed,

713
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,280
but this poem alone

714
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,470
can show he's really talented.

715
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,120
What you said just now

716
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,710
is secretly against Fan Xian.

717
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,950
Are you afraid that

718
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,630
this young man might surpass you one day

719
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,360
and gain a better reputation than you?

720
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,150
Everyone else present here is either a trustworthy minister

721
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,760
or a learned scholar.

722
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,000
They certainly don't like to argue.

723
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,600
Ignorant as I am,

724
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,360
I'm willing to speak up for

725
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,470
our talent of Nanqing.

726
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,600
Are you referring to that seven-character poem?

727
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,760
Exactly!

728
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,950
Master, have you got any poem

729
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,950
better than that?

730
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,190
Yunrui, mind your manners in the Hall.

731
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,000
Master Zhuang, you're broad-minded.

732
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,040
Please forgive her for being rude.

733
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,360
The wind so swift, the sky so wide, apes wail and cry;

734
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:04,760
Water so clear and beach so white, birds wheel and fly.

735
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,800
The boundless forest sheds its leaves shower by shower;

736
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,840
The endless river rolls its waves hour after hour.

737
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,520
A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

738
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Ill now and then for years, alone I'm on this height.

739
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,600
Living in times so hard, at frosted hair I pine;

740
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,950
Cast down by poverty, I have to give up wine.

741
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,630
What a fantastic poem!

742
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,910
I've written poems my whole life,

743
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,320
but none

744
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,470
can match that.

745
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,360
So Master Zhuang,

746
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,800
you admit defeat candidly.

747
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,000
The first four lines are wonderful.

748
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,760
But people all say

749
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,870
the essence of the poem

750
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,910
is the latter four lines.

751
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,120
The latter four lines are absolutely marvelous.

752
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,360
But unfortunately,

753
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,840
they were not written by Mr. Fan.

754
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,760
So Fan Xian copied the poem.

755
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,040
Yes.

756
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,760
I also find it strange.

757
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,190
How could he

758
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,630
be so talented?

759
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,280
Fan Xian,

760
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,040
do you have anything to say?

761
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,120
Master Zhuang can say

762
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,910
whatever he likes.

763
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,910
After all, highly respected as Master Zhuang,

764
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,320
what he says counts even if he has no proof.

765
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,630
Your Majesty,

766
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,360
I can prove that

767
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,470
Fan Xian wrote the poem at the poetry gathering

768
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,190
held in Prince Jing's mansion.

769
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Guo Baokun, the Imperial Compiler

770
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,710
was also there.

771
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,470
He can be a witness.

772
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,870
Is Guo Baokun here?

773
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

774
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,470
Did Fan Xian write the poem?

775
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,670
Yes.

776
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,230
In this case,

777
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,600
Master Zhuang is trying to frame Fan Xian up on purpose.

778
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,840
He might be misled by others

779
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,470
to form such a misunderstanding.

780
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,870
What a coincidence!

781
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,710
The latter four lines of the poem

782
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,710
were written by my teacher

783
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,800
when he was visiting Tingzhou.

784
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,630
It should to be a good thing to see

785
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,840
such wonderful lines reappearing in the world.

786
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,360
But Mr. Fan

787
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,710
actually made a name with other's poem.

788
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,630
Is that appropriate?

789
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,470
For scholars, morality is more important than talent.

790
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,870
The first four lines of the poem

791
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,190
are remarkable.

792
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,120
Mr. Fan is definitely talented.

793
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,870
But why does he have to be so greedy

794
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,800
as to make a name

795
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,950
with other's work.

796
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,800
I was hesitant about

797
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,910
telling the truth.

798
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,670
But after careful thinking,

799
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,430
I feel that by telling the truth,

800
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,430
I might help Mr. Fan

801
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,870
correct his mistake.

802
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,840
There's no making without breaking.

803
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,000
He can focus on moral cultivation in future.

804
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,390
Mr. Fan,

805
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,150
I told the truth

806
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,560
because I cherish your talents.

807
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,560
I mean no harm.

808
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,950
Please be introspective.

809
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,630
Fan Xian,

810
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,670
feel free to speak your mind.

811
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,630
Master Zhuang,

812
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,630
is your teacher surnamed Du?

813
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,390
No.

814
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,000
Never mind.

815
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,040
Master Zhuang is known for

816
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,360
respecting teachers and honoring truth,

817
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,630
I suppose he won't use his teacher's reputation

818
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,670
to frame up an innocent man.

819
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,520
But men are hard to predict.

820
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,280
He might feel unhappy

821
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,430
seeing a young man rising to his fame

822
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,950
and make all this up to destroy his future.

823
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,630
Your Highness,

824
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,840
are you suspecting me of framing this young man up

825
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,670
at the cost of my teacher's reputation?

826
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,840
I dare not.

827
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,760
It's just that unlike Beiqi,

828
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,000
Nanqing emphasizes laws.

829
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,840
If you want to accuse someone,

830
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,760
words alone

831
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,560
won't be enough.

832
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,600
Your Highness, you've made a point.

833
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,430
Look, it was written by my teacher

834
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
back then.

835
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,120
Could it be

836
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,760
the proof?

837
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,470
The lines are exactly the same.

838
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,380
In the river of history,

839
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,580
time goes round and round.

840
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,940
Memories about the former and present lives

841
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,820
join each other in an endless way.

842
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,420
In the long drunken Milky Way,

843
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,140
one season follows another in a flash,

844
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,340
and the wild geese are flying south.

845
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,260
I just can't give up

846
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,260
to be with you for my whole life.

847
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:31,540
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

848
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

849
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,220
Year after year in the wandering,

850
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,780
I count the remaining years.

851
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,980
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

852
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,540
even though we have ended up the destiny,

853
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,220
I never feel regretful.

854
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,180
In such a chaotic world,

855
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,940
I still miss you as ever.

856
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,580
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

857
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,300
With a gentle heart,

858
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,860
I cherish our remaining years.

859
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,700
Even though we have to go through

860
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,660
all the hardships along the journey,

861
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:10,980
you always stay by my side,

862
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,740
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

863
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,660
Year after year in the wandering,

864
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,020
I count the remaining years.

865
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,380
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

866
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,180
even though we end up the destiny,

867
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,620
I never feel regretful.

868
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,540
In such a chaotic world,

869
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,500
I still miss you as ever.

870
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,180
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

871
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,940
With a gentle heart,

872
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,340
I cherish our remaining years.

873
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,140
Even though we have to go through

874
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,300
all the hardships along the journey,

875
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:51,580
you always stay by my side...
