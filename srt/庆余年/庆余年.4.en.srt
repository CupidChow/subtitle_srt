17
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,170
Close the door.

18
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,540
Tell the servants.

19
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,210
Let them clean up the servants' kitchen

20
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,070
to let Fan Xian move in.

21
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,770
Yes.

22
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,650
- Madam.
- Is he still not out?

23
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,710
Yes. There is no noise. It's very quiet.

24
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,490
Sizhe! Sizhe!

25
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,120
Wake up!

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,130
Mom, ten taels of silver are enough. (T/N: About 500 grams.)

27
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,640
You–

28
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,730
It's not good for me to show up.

29
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,410
You go to your dad's study.

30
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,390
Tell him that you are worried that he hasn't had any food yet and ask him if he wants any dessert.

31
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,960
And take the chance to check what Fan Xian is doing in the study.

32
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:00,110
What you say is very true. I will do it.

33
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,590
You can walk Young Master there.

34
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,190
Yes.

35
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,030
He is behaving so well.

36
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,980
It seems that he is improving after all.

37
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,230
- Lead the way faster.
- Yes.

38
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,560
Father, you haven't had food at this time.

39
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,650
I, your son, am so worried about you.

40
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,070
- I'm really worried!
- Young Master!

41
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,150
- Am I stupid or what!
- Young Master!

42
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,890
Madam! Young Master has run away!

43
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,750
<i>[Fan Jian: Southern Qing's Minister of Revenue, Earl of Sinan]</i>

44
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,780
Are you anxious about all the waiting?

45
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm saying hello to my father.

46
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,600
To answer your question, I'm not.

47
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,490
I have been waiting for so many years in Danzhou. I'm not anxious about it a little while.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,620
You seem to be complaining with what you said.

49
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,470
Do you need me to cry sadly and hold you for one hour

50
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,050
- to show that I'm really sorry?
- Please don't.

51
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,250
That's what I thought, too.

52
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,460
Let's talk about business then.

53
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,850
What kind of person do you want to become?

54
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,950
Being safe all my life and the richest man in the country.

55
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,580
With a beautiful wife and cute mistresses, an elegant Don Juan.

56
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,490
Sorry, I'm really cheesy.

57
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,820
How do you want to start your business?

58
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,310
I have been thinking about this for a long time.

59
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,000
I have a unique technique.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,880
With high temperatures, I can use sand to make things that are smooth, transparent,

61
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
magical things that look like crystal.

62
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
I call it glass. Once I reveal it to the world–

63
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,010
Where did you get it?

64
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,050
Your mom made it.

65
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,920
And the technique is very mature.

66
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,640
It's okay. I have another thing.

67
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,100
I can use oil to make things that clean the body and clothes.

68
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,520
This thing is smooth and fragrant.

69
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,510
It's tens of thousands of times better than Soap-pod Locust and ashes of coal.

70
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,930
I'll call it soap.

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,110
Your mom made it.

72
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,840
We not only have soap but also have scented soap.

73
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,340
It's okay. I still have something.

74
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,070
Now when we eat sweet things, other than honey,

75
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,120
we mainly use caramel or maltose.

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,820
Even if we have sucrose, it is pretty rough.

77
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,260
I have a way to purify sucrose,

78
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,990
to make sugar that is as white and small as snow. It tastes so much better.

79
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,900
White sugar. We have two big jars in the kitchen.

80
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,570
Did my mom make it as well?

81
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,160
Yes. Your mom made it.

82
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,420
Why did I never see these when I was in Danzhou?

83
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,170
All these things are being used by rich and powerful people.

84
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,960
They only exist in big cities.

85
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Then it's because I lived in the village?

86
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,350
What other ideas do you have?

87
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,090
Nothing.

88
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,120
Why do I have to be born if there was my mom?

89
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,330
Your mom had so many great ideas for doing business.

90
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,480
The shops at that time were really the top.

91
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,090
It was the center of all the wealth in the world.

92
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,410
I have heard of it.

93
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,290
I heard that after she passed away, the stores went back to the country.

94
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,540
Not the country. It's controlled by the royal family.

95
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,200
It's called "Inside Treasury."

96
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,470
Who named it? It's so vulgar. 
<i>(T/N: The pronunciation is the same as the word "underwear")</i>

97
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,770
Don't say that. The emperor named it.

98
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,480
Why is that word vulgar?

99
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,250
Ignore me. Keep talking.

100
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,080
The emperor is busy with politics and there are so many things going on in the country.

101
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,480
So he doesn't have the energy to run the inside treasury himself.

102
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:30,000
So he put Princess Royal, Li Yunrui, to be in charge of the Inside Treasury.

103
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,340
Princess Royal is in charge of the Inside Treasury?

104
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,590
<i>Princess Royal is very beautiful and very gentle.</i>

105
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,690
<i>Although she is not the sister of the emperor, she is very trusted.</i>

106
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,920
<i>And she has not been married until now.</i>

107
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,420
<i>[Lin Yunrui: Princess Royal of Southern Qing]</i>

108
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,650
Father, do you like the Princess Royal?

109
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,020
Stop saying nonsense!

110
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,790
Since we met, you went from talking about the stores to the Princess Royal.

111
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,670
You said that we were talking about business, but we were actually only talking about gossip.

112
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,450
Do you know what gossip means?

113
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:34,460
Princess Royal has a daughter with the prime minister, Lin Ruofu.

114
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,160
Didn't you say that she was not married?

115
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,000
This is a secret.

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,660
So it is gossip.

117
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,940
The daughter of the Princess Royal is Lin Wan'er.

118
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,580
She is the one that you are going to marry coming here.

119
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,770
A bastard for a bastard.

120
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,520
A great match.

121
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,800
It's an order from the emperor.

122
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,030
Whoever can marry Lin Wan'er,

123
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,820
from Princess Royal Li Yunrui's hands,

124
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,720
can take over the responsibility to be in charge of the Inside Treasury.

125
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,410
Chen Pingping and Fei Jie don't want you to come to the capital now.

126
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,310
I will take you there when they are not around.

127
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,030
Because now it's the best chance to take back your mom's business.

128
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,830
You are taking back what should belong to you.

129
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,020
Here.

130
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,960
This is for you.

131
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,070
What is it?

132
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,450
Important things about the Inside Treasury from recent years.

133
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,340
Take a good look at it. It will benefit you for taking back the business.

134
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,510
- Actually–
- But you need to be careful as well.

135
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,150
The Inside Treasury is how the royal family gets their money.

136
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,780
There are a lot of people who don't want you to take over.

137
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,050
Yunrui shows her respect to Empress Dowager.

138
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,200
Get up.

139
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,780
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

140
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,800
<i>[Empress Dowager of Southern Qing]
</i>You are here at this time.

141
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,990
Empress Dowager, Fan Xian is in the capital now.

142
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,830
It's the kid that Earl of Sinan keeps in Danzhou?

143
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,790
After I gave birth to Wan'er, I sent her outside of the palace.

144
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,090
I always feel sorry to her.

145
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,570
I always want to find a good husband for her. Fan Xian is not talented or famous.

146
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,460
He is a village man from a distant village. How can he be a good fit for Wan'er?

147
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,580
So you–

148
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,300
I don't want Wan'er to marry him.

149
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,080
So Princess Royal disagrees.

150
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,660
That's right. She has disagreed from the beginning.

151
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,950
It's done then.

152
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,380
My mother-in-law doesn't agree. This marriage won't work.

153
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,370
You marrying Lin Wan'er is none of her business.

154
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,480
It's none of the mother's business?

155
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
When does the royal family take account of affections?

156
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,050
Are you trying to stop Fan Xian from marrying Wan'er?

157
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,940
Please, Empress Dowager, help me.

158
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,360
<i>[Hong Siku: head eunuch of Southern Qing]</i>

159
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,790
Princess Royal.

160
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,500
Eunuch Hong.

161
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,440
I apologize.

162
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,250
The emperor is the only one that can decide what happens in the harem.

163
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,810
Nobody cares if you like it or not.

164
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,500
This slap is to remind you that you need to know your place.

165
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,740
Yes.

166
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,310
As long as the emperor agrees, it doesn't matter what other people say.

167
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,380
But why does the emperor have to let me marry Lin Wan'er?

168
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,620
The emperor has four sons. The eldest son is outside, in charge of the military and the youngest son is still young.

169
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,630
Now the ones fighting for the position of the future emperor,

170
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,250
is the crowned prince and the second prince.

171
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,910
What does it have to do with me?

172
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,340
The Princess Royal is always supporting the crown prince.

173
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,410
The crown prince is in charge of the treasury of the royal family. This is a big no.

174
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,600
- So the person that's in charge of the Inside Treasury must change.
- Exactly.

175
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,310
If I'm in charge of the Inside Treasury, I'm shaking the foundation of the crown prince.

176
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,590
The assassination in Danzhou might start here.

177
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,040
What you mean is that people on the side of the crown prince are trying to kill me.

178
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,090
It's about their benefits. The possibility is large.

179
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,160
You said all this to tell me that Liu Ruyu has nothing to do with it.

180
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,040
- You don't believe me.
- You are talking about the crown prince.

181
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,160
Does it matter if I believe or not?

182
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,960
Follow me.

183
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,740
Princess Royal, the emperor wants to see you.

184
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,210
Please, Princess Royal, come this way.

185
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,410
Just lead the way.

186
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,310
<i>[Fan Ruoruo: Daughter of Southern Qing's Earl of Sinan, Fan Jian]</i>

187
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,250
<i>[Fan Sizhe: Second son of Southern Qing's Earl of Sinan, Fan Jian]</i>

188
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,980
I'm hungry.

189
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,190
Are you done talking? Please sit down.

190
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,090
It's all your fault. If you don't eat, Xian might be–

191
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,740
<i>[Fan Xian: illegitimate son of Southern Qing's Earl of Sinan, Fan Jian]</i>

192
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,360
We have some business to talk about. Go out. 
<i>[Liu Ruyu: Fan Xian's stepmother]</i> 
 <i>[Fan Jian: Southern Qing Minister of Revenue, Earl of  Sinan]</i>

193
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,070
Yes.

194
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,960
Just me?

195
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,770
- Go out now.
- Yes.

196
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,950
Did you send House Manager Zhou to Danzhou?

197
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,440
You know about that.

198
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,190
Danzhou is far away. I was just thinking that

199
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,440
we would feel more assured to have someone from our family to take care of Xian'er.

200
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,950
In Danzhou, he tried to kill Fan Xian.

201
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,330
Ki-Kill?

202
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,910
Don't you know?

203
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,040
I haven't gotten a letter this month. I didn't know.

204
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,890
There won't be any letter.

205
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,000
Mom has sent him onto a fish boat. He will be on it for a few years.

206
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,170
He was always outside.

207
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,790
It's so unexpected that he could be as vicious as that!

208
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,280
It's so lucky that Xian'er is well.

209
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,660
House Manager Zhou has told everything.

210
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,640
He said that he got your secret letter

211
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,300
to work together with the Inspection and Control Bureau

212
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,200
to kill Fan Xian.

213
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,380
Why is the Inspection and Control Bureau involved?

214
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,530
They have fake orders over there.

215
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,910
The Inspection and Control Bureau only follows the order of the emperor.

216
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,400
Whoever can put spies in the Inspection and Control Bureau

217
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,690
must be from the royal family.

218
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,600
The mom of the youngest princess, Imperial Consort Yi,

219
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,940
is your cousin.

220
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,530
So, Master, I-I want to kill Fan Xian?

221
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,360
- Don't you?
- No!

222
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,390
- Why not?
- I–

223
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,380
Tell him.

224
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,490
If I wanted to kill you,

225
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,190
I would have found someone who had nothing to do with me!

226
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,480
I wouldn't let House Manager Zhou do it!

227
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,010
I'm not that stupid!

228
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,700
Maybe you are thinking the other way around.

229
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,930
I have no reason to kill you!

230
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,380
The family property is the reason.

231
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,550
No, Fan Xian!

232
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,040
I might be against you. I might suppress you.

233
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,960
- But I would never kill you!
- Why?

234
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,350
If you die because of me,

235
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,550
Master will kick me and Sizhe out of the Fan family.

236
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,390
I... The...

237
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,720
- Ruoruo!
- I think she is right.

238
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,210
If she wanted to kill you, she wouldn't have let people that are close to her get involved.

239
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,970
Right!

240
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,390
How is it?

241
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,800
A few sentences can't prove anything.

242
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,370
I–

243
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,760
You can look it up yourself. Let's eat first.

244
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,270
You are here.

245
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,750
Your reward from the Princess Royal.

246
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,230
<i>[Lin Yunrui: Princess Royal of Southern Qing]</i>

247
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,750
Your Majesty, Princess Royal is here.

248
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,630
<i>[Qing Emperor, Emperor of Southern Qing]</i>

249
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,980
Don't hate Empress Dowager for her slapping.

250
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,920
I just don't want Wan'er to marry a village man!

251
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,650
You can just say what you want.

252
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,590
Why do you have to destroy his reputation outside?

253
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,130
What are you talking about?

254
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,800
I don't understand.

255
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,610
Don't understand?

256
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,310
Gong Dian.

257
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,170
- I'm here.
- Go check.

258
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,240
Who has sent the maids outside today to buy things?

259
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
Yes.

260
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,600
Sit down.

261
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,130
Here! Eat when they are still hot!

262
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,560
- Eat more!
- There are so many good things!

263
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,430
Here, I'll get you some soup.

264
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,560
- Okay. You are so polite!
- This soup is winter melon cooked with clams.

265
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,050
I have asked people to send the clams. You try it.

266
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,530
Thank you so much! Aunt, I have never seen this kind of cooking in Danzhou!

267
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,480
- Really? Try it!
- How is it?

268
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,570
- How is it?
- Joy!

269
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,190
- Good!
- It's good that you like it.

270
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,030
Aunt, Father. I have brought this fish from Danzhou.

271
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,450
- Try it.
 -Let me try it!

272
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,180
It looks so good! You are so thoughtful!

273
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,370
If you like it, I will ask people to send more!

274
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,440
- I really like it! It smells so good!
- It's good that you like it.

275
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,950
Eat more, Master.

276
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,840
- Here.
- Aunt, did you make all of these?

277
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,320
- I did.
- My dad is so lucky!

278
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,790
I made those especially for you!

279
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm lucky, too!

280
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,900
I will learn cooking from you later.

281
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,970
- Let me cook for you, okay?
- Of course.

282
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,390
- Let me see what I want to learn.
- Here. Try more.

283
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,840
Sister,

284
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
when I was out, what happened to them?

285
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,930
Why are they so close all of sudden?

286
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,890
Nothing. We are just suspecting that your mom wants to kill your brother.

287
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,690
Here! Try this!

288
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,830
- I'll get it for you.
- This one is good.

289
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,970
Sister, don't lie to me.

290
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,440
It is all true.

291
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,290
I'm so happy to see you eating!

292
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,360
I'll eat more then.

293
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,040
- Here!
- You try this.

294
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,730
Okay.

295
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,130
Your Majesty, the one that arranged things today

296
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,290
was Offical Han from the Harem Bureau.

297
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,020
Where is she?

298
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,010
She has... hung herself.

299
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,300
Do you want to ask me what my relationship is with that Offical Han?

300
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,660
Why do you have to be so clear?

301
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,800
If Your Majesty asks, I will answer.

302
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,130
Are you tired?

303
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,450
I don't feel tired resting all day in the palace.

304
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,740
That's good. Sit here and wait.

305
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,030
Can I please ask Your Majesty what we are waiting for?

306
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,790
For somebody.

307
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,880
Who is coming? If it's a male official, I should probably go.

308
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,770
You will know who it is when he is here.

309
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,740
Your Majesty, Crown Prince has asked to see you.

310
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,400
Let him in.

311
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,900
Look. There he is.

312
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,610
Don't just kneel here. Talk.

313
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,160
I let the maids stop him.

314
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,540
Please punish me.

315
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,100
I'm very disappointed in you.

316
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,970
I know that I'm wrong.

317
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,210
Li Yunrui has admitted nothing.

318
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,490
I made that mistake out of a rush!

319
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,900
I feel so guilty now that I think about it.

320
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,200
You should appoint the person that's in charge of the Inside Treasury.

321
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,970
I shouldn't do things like this.

322
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,300
The Inside Treasury has the wealth of the whole world.

323
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,750
If you don't fight for it as the crown prince,

324
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,710
what kind of crown prince are you?

325
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:57,160
What makes me disappointed is the means you used.

326
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,030
Let me ask you. What's the difference between a royal family member and a normal citizen?

327
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,390
It's like Heaven and Earth, the cloud and the ground.

328
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,730
Somebody has said that

329
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,350
they all have two hands and two eyes.

330
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,710
The prince and the peasant

331
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,490
are all ordinary human beings.

332
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,320
Your Majesty, these words are madness!

333
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,740
Then, what are all the cumbersome principles and strict laws for?

334
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,550
It's for protecting the foundation of the country.

335
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,520
For protecting the foundation of the country?

336
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,990
It's just for building a high tower

337
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:46,090
in people's hearts so that you can be superior to the masses with dignity and respect.

338
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,940
Whoever said that should be executed.

339
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,880
Destroying the people's reputation with such scandals!

340
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,320
You have become a joke for them.

341
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,120
If there are too many jokes, people don't respect you.

342
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,690
Without respect, where can you get dignity?

343
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,710
The tower will fall down!

344
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,000
You are destroying the roots yourself!

345
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,810
Your Majesty, I understand.

346
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,070
You don't understand!

347
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,470
Think about it.

348
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,150
Come here.

349
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,440
This is the list for the officials that are about to be laid off.

350
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,470
You should be ready for it.

351
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,810
Look at who is on this list!

352
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,730
Are there any of your guests?

353
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,330
I was a crown prince once.

354
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,090
I have fought for what I should.

355
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,170
But you should at least have a bottom line.

356
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,530
- Your Majesty.
- Go away.

357
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,050
- Your Majesty.
- Go away!

358
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,480
Father.

359
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,320
I'll go read.

360
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,590
I'll go read, too.

361
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,820
Yes.

362
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,780
Master, I have cleaned up Xian'er 's room.

363
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,920
I'll show him right now to see what's missing.

364
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,600
You can go back to the room now.

365
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,110
I have something to tell Xian'er.

366
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,680
Yes.

367
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:28,140
This is the capital. You should be more cautious from now on.

368
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,210
I'm always cautious.

369
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,340
You took back the assassin from the Inspection and Control Bureau. Is this cautious?

370
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,730
Do you know about Teng Zijing?

371
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,290
The guards that take you back are the top.

372
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:45,740
Do you think that they don't know there is one more person?

373
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,600
- What?
- Wanted notice. I found this in the case file of the Ministry of Sanctions.

374
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,480
<i>[Wanted notice]</i>

375
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,590
For Teng Zijing? What did he do?

376
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,390
I don't know. And there is no need to know.

377
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,870
Be careful about him.

378
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,650
It was from before. He is not around anymore.

379
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,080
The people from the Inspection and Control Bureau...

380
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,290
Don't get involved with them too much.

381
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,730
Also, if it's the crown prince that wants to kill you–

382
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,610
I will investigate in private. Don't act on your own.

383
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,470
On my own? What can I do?

384
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,540
Can I go into the palace and kill the crown prince?

385
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:49,100
If it was before, your mom could really do this.

386
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,540
It's so cool!

387
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,070
There were no rules in this world that could limit her.

388
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,990
She could always do what others couldn't think of.

389
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
How did my mom die?

390
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,500
Somebody killed her.

391
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,840
Is the one that killed her still alive?

392
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,290
I don't know.

393
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,540
Normally, whoever is involved in your mom's death

394
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,420
should all be killed.

395
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,350
But Chen Pingping and I feel that

396
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,580
there is danger hidden in the capital that we can't see.

397
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,370
So I kept you in Danzhou.

398
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,730
In the end, I'm in the capital after all.

399
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,930
I have said that it's the best chance to get back your mom's business.

400
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,150
- You are right.
- Okay.

401
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,490
You are tired. Take a good rest.

402
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,120
The marriage with Lin Wan'er–

403
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,310
I will arrange it. You don't need to worry about anything.

404
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't want to marry her.

405
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,870
What did you say?

406
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,570
I said that I don't want to marry that Lin Wan'er.

407
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,030
Didn't you understand anything that I have said?

408
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,480
I did.

409
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,450
My mom had a business.

410
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,010
This business now belongs to the royal family.

411
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,250
Marrying this Lin Wan'er can get back the business.

412
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,750
Now it's a great chance.

413
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,720
I understand all that you have said.

414
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,390
I just don't want to marry her.

415
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,680
Why?

416
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,980
I'm in love with a girl that was secretly eating a chicken drumstick.

417
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,600
What?

418
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,690
It has nothing to do with this.

419
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,230
Maybe if I don't meet her, I will not marry this Lin Wan'er.

420
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,630
The business of the Inside Treasury is what your mom has spent her whole life on.

421
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,010
I understand that this is very important to you.

422
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,160
But-But... How can I tell you this?

423
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,480
Look. Look.

424
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,770
I can move this.

425
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,910
It will bleed if I cut it.

426
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,370
I'm growing recently and I eat a lot.

427
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,510
Vegetables are good for my health, but I still like meat.

428
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,060
Eating too much meat will make my nose bleed,

429
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,260
and my fingernails are growing too fast and I have to cut them every day.

430
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,990
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

431
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,990
I'm telling you that I'm a human being!

432
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,820
I'm not a chess piece. I'm not a chip.

433
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,620
I'm a real, live human being.

434
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,330
Why do I need to exchange my own life

435
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,180
for a business?

436
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,560
You need to understand, Xian'er,

437
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,940
that if you are in charge of the Inside Treasury,

438
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,160
you will be in charge of

439
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,300
wealth you can't even count.

440
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,350
Did you marry my mom because of her money?

441
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,220
That's enough!

442
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,130
I can't marry her.

443
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,000
I want to live for myself.

444
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,790
It's all people on Crown Prince's side.

445
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,400
His Majesty is punishing me.

446
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,360
It's punishment and a reminder.

447
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,410
People on this list belong to the Ministry of War and Personnel.

448
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,790
Take a look for yourself.

449
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,430
His Majesty wants to tell Crown Prince that

450
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,780
the bottom line is the army. The appointment of people.

451
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,730
If you don't cross the line, whatever you want,

452
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,140
you can do anything.

453
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,570
If that's the case, we can take the Inside Treasury.

454
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,030
His Majesty said that we used the wrong way.

455
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,490
But he didn't say that we can't do anything to Fan Xian.

456
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,910
Aunt, what do you think we should do?

457
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,300
Why does His Majesty pick Fan Xian to fight for the Inside Treasury?

458
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,850
He has never been to the capital and he doesn't belong anywhere.

459
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,650
There are a lot of people like that. Why does it have to be him?

460
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,890
There is a gossip that Fan Xian has a pen name

461
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:13,980
and wrote a mystery book called "The Red Chamber's Dream."

462
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,550
I was wrong.

463
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:24,520
I should start from what he is famous for to destroy his roots.

464
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,430
"Red Chambers' Dream?"

465
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,720
Young Master.

466
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,350
- Take this for me.
- Give it to me. Give it to me.

467
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,460
Put it down.

468
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,250
There is no need for all of those.

469
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,190
Go back.

470
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,920
Young Master, we will be your servants from now on.

471
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,300
Where can we go?

472
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,360
You... I have hands and feet. I'm very healthy.

473
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,470
I don't need a servant.

474
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:36,500
Also, being a human, there is no difference between noble and lowly. We are all the same.

475
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,860
You should live for yourself.

476
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,370
Go.

477
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,040
What are you doing?

478
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,500
Young Master, if we have done anything wrong,

479
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,850
you can just criticize us and beat us. Don't scare us like that.

480
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,090
- Yes, Young Master.
- How did I scare you?

481
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,220
I'm telling you all of this so seriously.

482
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,150
Also, why are you still saying "servants?"

483
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,620
There is no difference between human beings.

484
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,600
You are your own master.

485
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,970
Young master! We belong to the Fan family, live or die! We don't have any second thoughts!

486
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,220
<i>We don't have any second thoughts!</i>

487
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,640
<i>It's obvious that debating on a different level of knowledge</i>

488
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,790
<i>it's not fair to start with.</i>

489
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,550
<i>Management is art.</i>

490
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,800
<i>Sometimes, you need to be straightforward.</i>

491
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,890
Get out of here!

492
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,630
I'm a lonely person! I don't like people to be in my yard!

493
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,890
Go! Go now! Go! Do what you want!

494
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,900
Young Master, you... if you had said that earlier, we would have understood.

495
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,100
Get out of here if you understand!

496
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,530
Yes, Young Master. We'll go then.

497
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,100
If there is anything, just tell us.

498
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,070
Get out of here! I'll beat you with a board if you don't go.

499
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,160
Yes, Young Master. You guys get a board for Young Master on your way back.

500
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,150
Get out of here!

501
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,910
- Young Master, you have worked hard! Go to bed earlier!
 - He is living alone. Who will be in charge of his daily life?

502
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:20,360
It's okay. There are so many weird young masters and ladies in different families.

503
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,890
It's nothing. It's just that what he said in the beginning

504
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,110
- was a little frightening.
- Okay, you guys. Listen to me.

505
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,820
It's nothing.

506
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,760
When he said that he was going to beat us with a board, it started to sound a lot more familiar.

507
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,660
Right.

508
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,570
<i>Fan Xian. Fan Xian.</i>

509
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,980
<i>Fan Xia, are you asleep?</i>

510
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,580
<i>I'm Fan Sizhe. I have something to talk to you about.</i>

511
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,050
<i>I'll come in.</i>

512
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,500
You are asleep.

513
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,130
Wake up.

514
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,790
Don't sleep. I have something to talk to you about.

515
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,890
Why are you sleeping so soundly? Fan Xian.

516
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,460
Wake up.

517
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,130
Fan Xian, have you not slept in Danzhou?

518
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,800
Are you awake or not?

519
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,240
I have something to tell you.

520
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,230
Today... I almost beat you.

521
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,260
I shouldn't have done that. We are related after all, right?

522
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,980
Here is the thing. Tomorrow, at noon, we'll find a restaurant

523
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,020
and I will invite you to lunch to apologize to you.

524
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,830
What do you think?

525
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,110
It's a yes then.

526
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,620
Don't forget about it. Tomorrow at noon.

527
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,700
I'll go then. I put it on your table.

528
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,990
Fan Xian!

529
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,620
Who is he?

530
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,480
What?

531
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,820
The guard that sent me back to the capital.

532
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,920
You kick out all the maids

533
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,730
and you leave a guard.

534
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,850
What kind of habit do you have?

535
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,010
Do you have something to tell me?

536
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,270
One more thing. My dad is a little old-fashioned.

537
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,160
But no matter how old-fashioned he is, he is your dad. Do you know that?

538
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,080
You don't have to explain it to me.

539
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,740
Okay then.

540
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,060
Don't tell him about lunch tomorrow.

541
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,700
I know.

542
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,420
Get to your business.

543
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,430
Where were you?

544
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,690
Any place that you can't see.

545
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,350
Didn't you leave?

546
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,540
<i>[Fan]</i>

547
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,770
Let me tell you. He was tricked.

548
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,210
Tomorrow morning, find a few guys and go out with me.

549
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,250
I need to educate this bumpkin from Danzhou.

550
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,280
He is a young master after all.

551
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,330
He is the young master, and I'm not?

552
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,410
- Get out of here!
- Yes.

553
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,690
Your case files

554
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,260
were all taken away by the Inspection and Control Bureau.

555
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,790
The only thing that's left

556
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,620
is this wanted notice.

557
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,280
Your crime at that time

558
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,900
was the assassination of an important official.

559
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,550
This is so strange.

560
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,670
Why would the Inspection and Control Bureau

561
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,850
take somebody like you.
