1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 17

16
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,870
What did you witness

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,270
on the boat on that day?

18
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,680
I didn't see anything.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,680
You're lying.

20
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,230
You know that guy!

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,000
No!

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,720
No?

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,910
That means you did see someone.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,000
Stop asking!

25
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,550
You're daughter of the Chief Guard of the capital city,

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,830
but you still dare not

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,680
say who it is.

28
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,080
It must be someone

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,480
with enormous power.

30
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,720
Fan Xian, stop investigating.

31
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,520
Who is he?

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,800
You're new to the capital city

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
and you don't know well of the situation.

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,600
If you don't stop,

35
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,960
your followers, and your family

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,800
will be in danger.

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
It's not that I'm not willing to tell you the truth.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because I can't put

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,830
the whole Ye family at risk.

40
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,550
I understand.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,000
All the clues couldn't be followed up and there is no way out.

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,670
This is the only way.

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,630
There's only one way out.

44
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,910
Your Excellency,

45
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,240
you'd already promised me to

46
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,390
move these vats away last time.

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
You always don't come in through the front door.

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,600
If I move them away,

49
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,750
how can I know you come in.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,440
Why are you still carrying the case?

51
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,550
Didn't you go home?

52
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,910
I did.

53
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,550
I think I may use it

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,110
when I do something for you.

55
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,000
So I take it with me.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,390
Put it down and sit.

57
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,670
Have more.

58
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,440
You prefer bank notes or silver cashes.

59
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,630
Bank notes. They're easy to hide.

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
The promised fifty taels of silver.

61
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,880
Your Excellency,

62
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,830
what about the ox, the land

63
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,070
and ten pigs

64
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,270
that you've promised to give me?

65
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,480
I have asked people to prepare them for you.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,670
Your Excellency you're always trustworthy

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
and treat me as your child.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,230
Wang Qinian,

69
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,880
it's a pity you don't do cross talk!

70
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,160
What is cross talk?

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,200
Linguistic art.

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,640
If it's what you wants me to do,

73
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,790
I can learn.

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
You don't need to learn it now.

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
If you're leisure,

76
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,830
have a chat with me.

77
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,760
About what?

78
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,760
Whatever.

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,950
Let it be.

80
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,390
Fine. You start it first, please.

81
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,880
How long have you been married?

82
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,270
Seven or eight years.

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,600
How old is your daughter?

84
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,920
Under the age of five.

85
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,000
When can I see her?

86
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,320
My little daughter is naughty.

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,550
She will scratch anyone she sees.

88
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,390
It's good to be lively as a child.

89
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,440
You're right, Your Excellency.

90
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,040
Where is Si Lili imprisoned?

91
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
The dungeon in the Investigator's Office.

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,350
Heavily fortified?

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,550
Heavily fortified.

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,880
You are good at drawing, right?

95
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,550
Yes.

96
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,880
About the entrance and exit to
the dungeon in the Investigator's Office

97
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,480
and the guard there,

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,350
draw a copy for me.

99
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,640
Your Excellency, these stuffs are…

100
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,390
Leave them alone.

101
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,110
Draw a copy of the entrance and exit

102
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,760
to the dungeon

103
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,550
and the guard conditions.

104
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,880
Your Excellency,

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,270
no one can survive from

106
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,390
invading into the dungeon of
the Investigator's Office down the ages.

107
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,270
Just draw it for me.

108
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,320
Brother, are you in there?

109
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,270
You mind your own business.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
Can I have a minute?

111
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,920
What's up?

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,270
I went to meet the Crown Prince today.

113
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,320
I told him

114
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,510
I'm willing to look into

115
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,640
your words and deeds for him.

116
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,270
He wasn't opposed to my idea.

117
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,830
Why did you turn to him?

118
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,600
I want to help you.

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,790
In the assassination happened in the Niulan Street,

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,160
you almost lost your life.

121
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,200
Now you take the suspect of the assassination,

122
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,160
Si Lili

123
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,950
back to the capital city.

124
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,640
The one who wants to kill you

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,110
will take actions for sure.

126
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,350
Are you suspecting that the Crown Prince wants to kill me?

127
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,640
It's not long that you come to the capital city.

128
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,200
You haven't made enemies with the Crown Prince,

129
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,670
except that you beat Guo Baokun

130
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,920
who is one of His Highness's followers.

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,200
To kill me for Guo Baokun?

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,070
Lack of motivation.

133
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,790
Then he must aim at the financial power of the Neiku.

134
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,070
It's just your baseless conjecture.
We are not sure about it.

135
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,510
So I went to meet him

136
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,230
to check whether

137
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,160
he has the absolute intention to kill you.

138
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,950
Can you confirm that?

139
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,040
I can't.

140
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,110
Rumor has it that

141
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,760
the Crown Prince is not
as talented as the Second Prince and

142
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,920
he is weak.

143
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,830
As what I have seen today,

144
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,830
he didn't show how he feels on his face

145
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
and hid his thoughts deep.

146
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,880
He couldn't be ordinary.

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,390
It's too dangerous.

148
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
Don't take risks anymore.

149
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,000
Brother, when I went to him today,

150
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,350
he was drawing.

151
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,640
It seemed he was being trapped for love.

152
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,040
How could you say that?

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,950
Except what he drew today,

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,110
there were many portraits of a lady

155
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,720
without the five sense organs

156
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,350
in his study.

157
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,830
He buried his feelings so deep

158
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,880
that he didn't want anyone to know

159
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,760
who the lady is.

160
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,110
Have you ever heard which lady

161
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,550
the Crown Prince has feelings for?

162
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,230
I never heard

163
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,920
which lady he get close to.

164
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,880
Whoever he likes,

165
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,880
as the Crown Prince,

166
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,350
he isn't supposed to puzzle over that.

167
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,640
What if the lady is a courtesan?

168
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,550
It doesn't matter.

169
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,640
It's nothing but gaining

170
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,790
a dissolute reputation.

171
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,760
He doesn't have to hide.

172
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,320
What if he knows the courtesan

173
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,710
is a secret agent from Beiqi?

174
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,320
Si Lili?

175
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,960
Once someone finds that

176
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,230
the Crown Prince colludes with Beiqi secretly,

177
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
the host of the Eastern Palace will be replaced.

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,030
The Crown Prince doesn't want to expose

179
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,230
who Si Lili really is.

180
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,710
And he can't get close to her either.

181
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,960
What he can do is bury his feelings

182
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,440
in his drawings.

183
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,400
The story is too dramatic.

184
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,640
Is it a story?

185
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,000
What do you mean by that?

186
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,520
Forget it. Keep saying.

187
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,350
Later,

188
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,110
he heard you slept with

189
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,470
Si Lili for one night.

190
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,910
Your affections drove him crazy.

191
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,440
So he wants to kill you to give vent to his anger

192
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
and forces Si Lili to get involved in the case.

193
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,550
He makes you two enemies of life and death

194
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,110
to relieve his deep depression.

195
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,710
Just because of seeing the portraits of a lady,

196
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,520
you make up a complete story at the moment?

197
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,590
It might be the whole story.

198
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,350
Your Excellency.

199
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,670
Your Excellency.

200
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,110
I'm here.

201
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,230
Your Excellency.

202
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,520
I have finished the copy

203
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
and written down

204
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
where the guards

205
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,030
and invisible sentries may stay for you.

206
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,230
Lady Ruoruo, you're here.

207
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,350
What copy? What about invisible sentries?

208
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,910
Brother, what are you going to do?

209
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,320
You have known I'm going to take actions tonight?

210
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,590
I knew it when you asked me

211
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,440
to draw the copy this afternoon.

212
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,840
Why are you waiting for me here?

213
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,960
The rope of the hook

214
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,520
is made of hairs and spider web.

215
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,400
It can't be broken easily

216
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,670
and is excellent for climbing over the wall.

217
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,470
I can climb walls with my unique inner power.

218
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,840
I don't have to use it.

219
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,280
This is the dizzy incense

220
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,710
that is best for using in a small room.

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,840
I learned to poison from a child.

222
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,840
I can make it myself.

223
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,400
The shoe sole is made of cotton

224
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,470
that is best for walking on

225
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,550
roofs and tiles at night.

226
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,400
You are here for selling goods?

227
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,710
Not selling. I will give them to you.

228
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,710
It's not like you.

229
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,550
Your Excellency,

230
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,230
invading into the dungeon,
you will be sentenced to death if you are caught.

231
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,590
I have a family.

232
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,150
Please forgive me for not going with you.

233
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,320
It will be good

234
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,550
if these things can help.

235
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,350
Pack them up.

236
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,440
No no no.

237
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,590
I have other things.

238
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,470
If I am arrested,

239
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,590
they can find you out

240
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,440
because of these things.

241
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,320
That makes sense.

242
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,150
Thanks.

243
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,840
Don't let anyone know you have seen me.

244
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,520
Now I probably know

245
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,710
why you want to

246
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,080
change the world.

247
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,230
A life was taken away,

248
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,670
but no one cares

249
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,960
just because he was a guard,

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,440
and he deserved the death.

251
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,440
We meet again.

252
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,590
Why are you here?

253
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,350
It's urgent. No more nonsense.

254
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,080
Tell me who on earth wants to kill me.

255
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,110
Take me out of here.

256
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,880
I will.

257
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,110
Tell me who he is,

258
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,030
I will save you.

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,080
You don't trust me?

260
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,590
Mr. Fan, why not turn your back to have a look first.

261
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,080
Si Lili is the secret agent from Beiqi

262
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,400
but colludes with the Capital Garrison.

263
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,400
The commander of the Capital Garrison died.

264
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,840
He was supposed to be killed.

265
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,280
We can know the person who demanded to kill

266
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,320
must be paramount and powerful.

267
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,400
Now Si Lili returns to the capital city.

268
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,710
You guess what's going on?

269
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,350
Kill her.

270
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,200
The Investigator's Office has already

271
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,080
set ambushes everywhere.

272
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,400
Fan Xian,

273
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,440
the moment you stepped on the Tianhe Street,

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,320
I had already got the report.

275
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,710
So, that you let me in is

276
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,110
to arrest me like catching a turtle in the jar…

277
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,200
Wait, allow me to change a word.

278
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,840
You want to arrest me like beating…

279
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,910
If you want to know the truth,

280
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,280
why don't you interrogate Si Lili by yourself?

281
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,030
You're the chief interrogator.

282
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,280
Me?

283
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,840
It's the key to her cell.

284
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,670
You'll take care of the case of Si Lili.

285
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,710
No matter what decision you will make,

286
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,960
the Investigator's Office

287
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,350
will support you to the end.

288
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,520
Why did you force me to leave at noon?

289
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,790
You hold no official position and is powerless.

290
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,200
The person involved dares to kill commander.

291
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,590
If he knows you are the chief interrogator of Si Lili,

292
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,200
it will do harm to you.

293
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,110
Keeping me out of the affair in public

294
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,960
is actually to protect me.

295
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,760
What if I didn't come tonight?

296
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,110
The Investigator's Office
has nothing to do with you from now on.

297
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,470
Who on earth are you?

298
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,200
Why does the Investigator's Office value you so much?

299
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,880
What you should worry about now

300
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,710
is your own fate.

301
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,110
I don't understand

302
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,350
why you protect him to this extent.

303
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,640
It's what the Head asks me to do.

304
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,350
You have been communicating with the Head

305
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,640
through secret letters.

306
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,790
That's why the black knights

307
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,000
came so timely.

308
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,840
When will the Head return to the capital city?

309
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,230
Soon.

310
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,550
Why does the Head value

311
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,790
Fan Xian so much?

312
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,440
Why not ask him in person?

313
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,670
Yan Ruohai,

314
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,520
have you known some secrets?

315
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,950
I only do what I have been told.

316
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,640
Your Excellency,

317
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,590
a invisible sentry sent messages back,

318
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
saying someone is approaching secretly.

319
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,520
There's really someone who wants to kill her.

320
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,160
Have you heard it clearly?

321
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,520
Your fate will

322
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,800
be decided by me.

323
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,430
I get it.

324
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,880
Then tell me the whole story about

325
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,800
the assassination

326
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,230
in the Niulan Street.

327
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm from Beiqi and ordered to lurk.

328
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,760
And I have the right to invoke fellows in the capital city.

329
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,110
I'm restricted to nothing

330
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,040
except for the royal orders.

331
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,230
So, you mean it's the Beiqi royal family

332
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,710
that wants to kill me.

333
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,760
Mr. Fan, although you are
endowed with civil and martial virtues,

334
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,520
I'm afraid you don't have the status.

335
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,590
So,

336
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,520
what's the truth?

337
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,040
Someone found that

338
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,070
I am a secret agent.

339
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,470
Have you disclosed some clues?

340
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,310
Not exactly.

341
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,160
Chen Jushu, who lurked outside the capital city

342
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
was also caught by him

343
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,070
and sent to the capital city secretly.

344
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,760
But the traces of Cheng Jushu

345
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,710
were only available

346
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,830
to big shots in Beiqi.

347
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,520
Big shots of Beiqi were involved in the case?

348
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,590
Then who else could disclose

349
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,560
my identity?

350
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,590
And then?

351
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,640
Chen Jushu is obstinate and unruly,

352
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,680
so, the guy came to the Joy Tsin House

353
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,640
and forced me to hand out the token of a secret agent.

354
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,880
If I didn't obey what he said,

355
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,070
he would disclose my identity.

356
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,950
Would Cheng Jushu obey the order,

357
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,000
if he saw the token?

358
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,880
Exactly.

359
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,190
I didn't know the one he wanted to kill

360
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,520
was you the other day.

361
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,310
Later I heard the Niulan Street assassination,

362
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,040
I got to know that I wouldn't make it,

363
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,760
so I burned the boat and left the capital city.

364
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,350
And then

365
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,230
I got caught up by you.

366
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,000
There is one point that doesn't make sense.

367
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,800
Now that that guy could

368
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,560
catch Cheng Jushu, the Eighth Dan
Martial Arts Master of Beiqi alive,

369
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,430
why did he make the unnecessary move?

370
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,950
Why not come to kill me in person?

371
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,400
I guess

372
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,710
they don't want to use their followers

373
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,230
to avoid releasing the clues.

374
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,110
When you met that guy,

375
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,640
was there anyone eavesdropping?

376
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,070
How do you know that?

377
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,880
There really was a lady

378
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,310
who made a noise outside the window at that time.

379
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,160
The two disciples of Si Gujian

380
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,470
forced one of her to fall into the Liujing River

381
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,710
with their swords.

382
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,920
I didn't know who the lady was,

383
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,830
because her face was covered with sleeves.

384
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,230
I couldn't see her trace after the salvage, either.

385
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,800
What matters the most is

386
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,520
who wants to kill me.

387
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,400
Let me leave the capital city,

388
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,470
and I'll tell you who he is.

389
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,800
I can't just let you go.

390
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,760
The most I can do is keep you alive.

391
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,110
I'd rather die than years be held in captivity.

392
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,350
Staying alive promises hope, right?

393
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,640
I don't want to stay alive in this way.

394
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,280
You won't tell me?

395
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,830
I won't.

396
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,000
Whatever moves you have,

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,310
then use them.

398
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,470
I won't torture you with cruel penalties.

399
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,280
You're soft-hearted?

400
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,350
Besides,

401
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,920
I will tell you

402
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,230
what I'm going to do.

403
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,000
Except putting me to torture,

404
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,070
what else can you do?

405
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,110
To be honest,

406
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,350
I have no idea

407
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,710
how many floors the dungeon has.

408
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,880
You can go ask first.

409
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I will ask someone to dig

410
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,640
a small enough dark room

411
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,280
under the deepest floor

412
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,560
for you to live alone.

413
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,110
It doesn't sound horrible.

414
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,160
What do you think is better to be kept there?

415
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,070
In such a narrow

416
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,280
and retired place,

417
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,190
merely designed for reserving things.

418
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,400
There will be no light

419
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,590
and sound

420
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,310
but the endless darkness and silence.

421
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,710
Trust me,

422
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,190
no one can stay

423
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,310
in such a place like that.

424
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,880
I can choose to die.

425
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,950
At least, I can commit suicide.

426
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,000
Take one,

427
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,230
you will be poisoned to death immediately.

428
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
I have offered you the chance to choose.

429
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Either

430
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,160
you spend the rest of your life
in the place under the deep ground,

431
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,190
or

432
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,400
I don't mind you

433
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,520
poisoning yourself to death in front of me.

434
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,920
If I die,

435
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,920
you will never know

436
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,880
who the guy is.

437
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,800
Do as you wish.

438
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,830
Take it.

439
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,430
What are you hesitating for?

440
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,190
Isn't death what you want?

441
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,950
Take it.

442
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,680
Si Lili, you won't poison yourself.

443
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,280
If you want to die,

444
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,760
you'd have killed yourself

445
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,110
when black knights appeared outside the capital city.

446
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,710
When I went downstairs,

447
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,470
I saw you there alone,

448
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,590
locked in the cage

449
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,520
without messy hairs.

450
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,830
You should have tidied yourself up.

451
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,430
How can a person

452
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,590
who cares that much about her appearance

453
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,430
will be willing to die?

454
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,430
Si Lili, you're so young

455
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,230
that you have too many hopes.

456
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,000
You'll get to know one day,

457
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,880
hope

458
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,040
is the most horrible thing

459
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,590
in this world.

460
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,520
Fan Xian,

461
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,400
you're a monster.

462
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,160
You're wrong.

463
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,590
I never eat my words.

464
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,230
You tell me the name,

465
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,950
I will keep you alive.

466
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,950
If I tell you the name,

467
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,950
how would you know whether I'm telling the truth?

468
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,830
I can judge for myself.

469
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,560
Fine.

470
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,040
I tell you the name.

471
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,000
Don't send me to the Ministry of Penalty.

472
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,560
Don't let me suffer these tortures.

473
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,800
Don't let anyone else humiliate me.

474
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I will keep my words.

475
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,040
Aren't you afraid of me lisping my tongue to death?

476
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,800
Do you dare?

477
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,800
It's you, again.

478
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,560
Your Excellency Zhu, Your Excellency Yan.

479
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
To tell you the truth,

480
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,950
I return to

481
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,470
take my stuff.

482
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,520
I haven't imagined that

483
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
our Investigator's Office is

484
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,280
fortified so heavily.

485
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
Good. It's great.

486
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
What do you want to take?

487
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,350
Your Excellency,

488
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,310
there are some bank notes

489
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,830
hidden in some of my office-copies

490
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,710
with postils

491
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,800
on the desk of my room.

492
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,880
Hide bank notes in the office-copies?

493
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,000
Your Excellency, you don't know the situation.

494
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,590
My wife always

495
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,000
frisks me

496
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,280
in an extremely thorough way.

497
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,160
So,

498
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,560
I can only choose some other ways to hide my stuffs.

499
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,680
Go search his room.

500
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,590
As you wish.

501
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,350
You see.

502
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,350
Fan Xian, don't investigate it anymore.

503
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,590
Don't tell anyone the truth

504
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,590
I investigate you for.

505
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,470
If someone else questions you,

506
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,520
you can say you're the secret agent of Beiqi.

507
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,280
Don't tell anyone

508
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,400
what the guy forces you into.

509
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,280
But if someone asks me

510
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,280
what you talked with me,

511
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,070
what should I answer?

512
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,520
There must be some other
secret agents in the capital city.

513
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,920
Give him some names.

514
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,190
Choose those who don't get along well with you.

515
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,400
Tell him this is all that

516
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,280
I have found today.

517
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,520
You hide everything

518
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
to protect that guy?

519
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,950
I want you to trust me.

520
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,110
I am the only one

521
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,920
who is willing to keep you alive

522
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,280
in the capital city now.

523
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,950
Fine.

524
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,160
The bank note belongs to me.

525
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,800
Thank you, Your Excellency.

526
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,710
Wang Qinian.

527
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,560
How is the interrogation going?

528
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,520
She has admitted that

529
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,470
she is the secret agent from Beiqi.

530
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,040
We have already known it.

531
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,560
This is the list of names of those

532
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,710
Beiqi secret agents who are hiding in the capital city.

533
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,800
Anything else?

534
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,520
That's all.

535
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,560
You really got something.

536
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,040
Leave the rest to me.

537
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,000
Wait.

538
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,350
What's wrong?

539
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,000
I have promised to let her go.

540
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,280
You promised?

541
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,280
No killing, no interrogating.

542
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,400
No torturing.

543
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,830
Just lock her in the dungeon.

544
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,920
Fan Xian, do you think you have

545
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,430
the right to make the decision?

546
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,830
He does have.

547
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,350
It's what the Head asks him to do.

548
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,400
The follow-up to Si Lili's case

549
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,590
will be handed over to Fan Xian.

550
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,920
Interrogate harder and harder.

551
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,760
Interrogate harder.

552
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,000
We must be able to find out something.

553
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,350
It's the Head's decision.

554
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,470
My plan is really simple.

555
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,400
Lock her inside.

556
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,560
Don't let anyone bother her.

557
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,470
One more thing,

558
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,800
don't let anyone know

559
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,350
that I have already interrogated her.

560
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,710
Do as you wish.

561
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,640
Your Excellency, what do you think?

562
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,640
It's the Head's decision.

563
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,230
Can I take him away?

564
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,230
It's up to you.

565
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,040
Let's go, Wang.

566
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,190
You said you wouldn't come with me, didn't you?

567
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,160
I couldn't help

568
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,040
but come here to check it out.

569
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,760
Wang Qinian, you're a good man.

570
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,400
What are you laughing at?

571
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,400
I never thought I would be the one

572
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,400
to send you

573
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,470
the Good Man Card.

574
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,800
What is the Good Man Card?

575
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,470
Nothing.

576
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,430
Nothing will happen tonight. You can go home.

577
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,070
Your Excellency, have you found out any clues?

578
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,070
You guys.

579
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,070
Listen to me.

580
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Keep what I say in mind.

581
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,400
Later when you go outside in the street,

582
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,280
use all your strength to

583
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,280
ring drums and gongs.

584
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,430
Use all your strength.

585
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,920
You who beat drums

586
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,830
don't stop

587
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,800
until you break your drums.

588
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,830
And you who beat small cymbals

589
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,760
should make it louder than big cymbals.

590
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,040
And you who beat big cymbals
should make it louder than gongs.

591
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,950
Are you clear?

592
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:26,920
Fan Sizhe.

593
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,830
You're running wild again.

594
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,520
Sister, I'm not.

595
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,520
I'm intending to help Fan Xian.

596
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,710
Fan Xian says

597
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,190
he's going to meet my future sister-in-law.

598
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,190
He asks me to

599
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,310
make a greater show of power.

600
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,710
This is magnificent.

601
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,000
Turn around, you guys.

602
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,680
Brother.

603
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,590
I went to Wan'er's place yesterday

604
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,950
and was stopped by her second brother.

605
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,560
I guess it must be because of me sneaking

606
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,110
into Wan'er's room.

607
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,760
I pondered over it for the whole night

608
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
and finally figured it out.

609
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
I'd better go there in public

610
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,160
in this way and at an open and frank attitude.

611
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,590
I will please him

612
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,280
and transfer his anger to happiness.

613
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,640
Isn't it magnificent enough?

614
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,880
A wedding ceremony won't be better than this.

615
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,520
Not to mention him sneaking in,

616
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,800
now he goes so far as to

617
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,680
come here with ringing gangs and drums.

618
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,640
If I don't split him to death,

619
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,880
I will give up my fame.

620
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,680
The ones using long weapons guard outside.

621
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,040
Those who are good at hidden weapons burn his bridge.

622
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,920
Don't be flustered.

623
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,350
Kill him as soon as he steps into the courtyard.

624
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,310
I will face the music

625
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,800
after he dies.

626
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,430
Let him in

627
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,110
but give him little chance of going back.

628
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,280
Dismiss.

629
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,280
As you wish.

630
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,230
Fan Xian, from the Fans mansion,

631
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,800
goes specially to the imperial residence

632
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,430
to visit the Princess.

633
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,040
This a great story on everybody's lips.

634
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,830
Hope everyone can join us to celebrate for him.

635
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,310
Bravo.

636
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,950
Bravo.

637
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,760
Fan Sizhe is really gregarious.

638
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,110
Brother,

639
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,190
Mr. Lin is the second brother

640
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,590
of the sister-in-law after all.

641
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,590
I know it.

642
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,190
You went to her boudoir secretly.

643
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,950
It's natural that he got angry.

644
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,880
So I go there in public this time.

645
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,310
It's no better than sneaking.

646
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,880
Is it?

647
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,760
If you do it like this,

648
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,040
it seems like you show disrespect

649
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,110
to Mr. Lin.

650
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Do you think so?

651
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,590
You didn't do this on purpose, did you?

652
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,760
On purpose for what?

653
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,800
You go there in public deliberately to

654
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,040
deceive the public

655
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
and relax their vigilance

656
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,000
by the farce with Mr. Lin.

657
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,040
Why would I do this?

658
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,830
Could it be that you've found clues

659
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,800
to the case happened in the Niulan Street?

660
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,560
Brilliant.

661
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,430
Is that so?

662
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,520
It's not proper to talk about this now
I will tell you the details later.

663
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,520
Ruoruo,

664
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,280
you can't go any further.

665
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,430
Or…

666
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,280
I'll wait here for you.

667
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,950
Okay.

668
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,840
Second brother,

669
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,710
Second brother, why do you have to create tension?

670
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,150
This bastard Fan Xian, his motive is execrable.

671
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,560
Why does he come here

672
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,600
aggressively?

673
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
Because I don't let him see you.

674
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,390
Your identity can't be known by the public.

675
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,120
Now he makes

676
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,910
everyone know it deliberately.

677
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,230
He wants to force me to retreat

678
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,520
without interfering

679
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,230
in the name of the Prime Minister.

680
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,840
Fine.

681
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,870
I won't show up to stop him.

682
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,120
I'll let him in.

683
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,280
Once he comes in,

684
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,430
he won't have the chance to go back.

685
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,520
Second brother, why do you have to do this?

686
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Second brother.

687
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,120
Her Highness is as gorgeous as a goddess.

688
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,040
I, Fan Xian, have been adoring her for long.

689
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,950
Since we have the marriage contract,

690
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,800
I should have the chance to meet her.

691
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,950
Am I right?

692
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,360
Let him in. Let him in. Let him in.

693
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,910
Let him in.

694
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,390
Let him in. Let him in. Let him in.

695
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,120
Let him in. They should meet each other.

696
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,320
Thank you for coming here.

697
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
Thanks.

698
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,670
Thank you.

699
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,470
Let him in.

700
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,360
Let him in. Let him in.

701
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,190
Let him in.

702
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,600
Let him in.

703
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,520
We make it.

704
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,390
You should leave!

705
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,520
The Second Young Master is going to kill you.

706
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,470
To think it over,

707
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,280
it's ridiculous to come here today in this way.

708
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,760
I'll see you again.

709
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,520
She's lying to me.

710
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,000
Second Young Master.

711
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,630
What's up?

712
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,950
As you have ordered,

713
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,190
we surrounded Fan Xian

714
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,000
as soon as he stepped into the courtyard.

715
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,600
We didn't imagine that

716
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,430
he is so crafty.

717
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,560
He climbed over the wall and ran away

718
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,910
after exchanging several blows with us.

719
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,280
We didn't chase him anymore.

720
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,630
Trash!

721
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,760
Back off!

722
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,230
As you wish.

723
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,670
Brat!

724
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,280
Is he a psycho?

725
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,430
He came here with great fanfare

726
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,670
but left without hesitation.

727
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,230
What on earth does he want?

728
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,910
He is not supposed to

729
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,280
go against you.

730
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,120
He has gone too far!

731
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,120
Second brother,

732
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,280
It's His Majesty

733
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
who ordered us to get engaged.

734
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,950
But you're a daughter

735
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,080
of the Prime Minister.

736
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,670
We don't have connections in public.

737
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,670
Wan'er.

738
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,470
You know the identity of our father.

739
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,950
He can't accept you in public.

740
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,950
And he has a guilty conscience.

741
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,710
I know it.

742
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,840
Though he doesn't speak it out loud,

743
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,360
you're still the daughter of the Lin family.

744
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,230
A man like Fan Xian doesn't

745
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,600
deserve you.

746
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,430
Second brother,

747
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,760
you have just met him for several times,

748
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,150
why do you make such a judgement?

749
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,390
This is what our father wants.

750
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,630
He has already prepared the office-copy well

751
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,230
and will choose a right time
to report to His Majesty in person

752
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,670
and ask him to call off the marriage contract.

753
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,910
Whatever messes Fan Xian makes,

754
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,760
he won't be able to change the overall situation.

755
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,230
He won't get a chance to marry you.

756
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,520
I've just heard that you went to find Wan'er.

757
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,000
Why are you here?

758
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,470
The same question I asked you last time.

759
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,150
Who was the guy

760
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,870
staying with Si Lili

761
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,040
in the Joy Tsin House the other day?

762
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,230
No matter how many times you ask me,
I won't say anything.

763
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,950
He is Lin Gong.

764
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,320
He is the second son of the Lin family.

765
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,190
Lin Gong.

766
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,320
I have known the answer

767
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,190
through your eyes.

768
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,840
It's him.

769
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,120
How could it be him?

770
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,840
How do you know that?

771
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,190
I didn't believe it

772
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,040
when I first heard

773
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,840
the name.

774
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,470
Since I don't have a feud with him,

775
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,080
so I roughly investigated

776
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,950
his background.

777
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,040
I drew a simple conclusion that

778
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,230
the Second Young Master of the Prime Minister Mansion

779
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,360
is one of the flat-out followers

780
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,390
of the Crown Prince.

781
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,390
And

782
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,560
this is the reason why

783
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,120
you don't dare to tell me the truth.

784
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,230
The Ye family has the support of the Great Master,

785
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,320
so the son of Prime Minister doesn't

786
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,040
mean anything to you.

787
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,950
But when it comes to the Crown Prince,
the situation is different.

788
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,000
If you offend the Crown Prince,

789
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,950
the status of the Ye family in the Nanqing

790
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,470
will be at risk.

791
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,120
You know that

792
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,670
the Crown Prince is the future emperor of the Nanqing.

793
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,230
No matter who asks me about this question,

794
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,520
I won't admit that

795
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,280
the one I met the other day was Lin Gong.

796
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,280
I understand.

797
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,040
What I want is the truth.

798
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,520
I won't make you testify for me.

799
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Fan Xian.

800
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,760
Just forget it.

801
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,120
You shouldn't go any further.

802
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,520
If no one died,

803
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,800
I would be willing to let it go.

804
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,520
Cheng Jushu was killed by you.

805
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,630
He is not the real murderer.

806
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,280
But the man died is just a guard.

807
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,760
Everyone says the same thing.

808
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,600
It really

809
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,280
makes me furious the most.

810
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,190
Have I said anything wrong?

811
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,230
Does the guard have another identity?

812
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,000
No, he doesn't. He is just a guard.

813
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,430
People in the whole world take him as nobody.

814
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,950
I don't agree with them.

815
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,600
What else can you do?

816
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,870
Thanks for telling me the truth.

817
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,950
Wan'er, take care of yourself

818
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,120
and don't be bothered by these things.

819
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,800
Since His Majesty ordered Fan Xian to leave Danzhou,

820
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,230
he must have made up his mind.

821
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,760
Father and I will take care of these.

822
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,360
His Majesty won't allow us to

823
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,470
call off the marriage contract,

824
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,710
even though father submits the memorials.

825
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,360
The result won't change.

826
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,040
There is always a way.

827
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,190
Don't worry.

828
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,710
I won't put you at risk.

829
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,000
But I'm willing to marry him.

830
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,560
You're deceived by

831
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,870
the sweet words of that brat.

832
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,150
He really has a glib tongue

833
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,630
and doesn't behave seriously sometimes,

834
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,670
but the expression in his eyes is really pure.

835
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,800
Second brother,

836
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,280
I don't know what has happened

837
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,630
between you two,

838
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,520
but he is definitely not a flibbertigibbet.

839
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,230
What kind of man he is

840
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,120
doesn't matter now.

841
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,080
Maybe he is a good man,

842
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,000
or maybe as you say,

843
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,600
he is sincere.

844
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,600
But he isn't supposed to come to the capital city.

845
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,600
Many people have been staring at him.

846
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,560
What do you mean?

847
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,420
In the river of history,

848
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,620
time goes round and round.

849
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,980
Memories about the former and present lives

850
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,860
join each other in an endless way.

851
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,460
In the long drunken Milky Way,

852
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,180
one season follows another in a flash,

853
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,380
and the wild geese are flying south.

854
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,300
I just can't give up

855
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,300
to be with you for my whole life.

856
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,580
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

857
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,380
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

858
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,260
Year after year in the wandering,

859
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,820
I count the remaining years.

860
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,020
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

861
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,580
even though we have ended up the destiny,

862
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,260
I never feel regretful.

863
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,220
In such a chaotic world,

864
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,980
I still miss you as ever.

865
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,620
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

866
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,340
With a gentle heart,

867
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,900
I cherish our remaining years.

868
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,740
Even though we have to go through

869
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,700
all the hardships along the journey,

870
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:36,020
you always stay by my side,

871
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,780
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

872
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,700
Year after year in the wandering,

873
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,060
I count the remaining years.

874
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,420
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

875
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,220
even though we end up the destiny,

876
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,660
I never feel regretful.

877
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,580
In such a chaotic world,

878
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,540
I still miss you as ever.

879
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,220
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

880
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,980
With a gentle heart,

881
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,380
I cherish our remaining years.

882
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,180
Even though we have to go through

883
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,340
all the hardships along the journey,

884
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:16,620
you always stay by my side...
