1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,820
Episode 24

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,680
Haven't seen you for a long time.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,440
Madam, you're gorgeous.

18
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,190
Eunuch, I'm so flattered.

19
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,550
I wonder

20
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,120
who want to see Xian'er today?

21
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,000
Those who watched the princess grow up

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,680
all want to see Mr. Fan.

23
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,510
The Empress Dowager

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,190
also wants to see him.

25
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,550
But she'll see him after lunch.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,600
Who should we visit first?

27
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,190
Madam, since you're here,

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,080
you certainly should visit Consort Yi first.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,830
What about the empress?

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,670
Her Majesty doesn't feel well today.

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,080
We'd better not disturb her.

32
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,800
This way, please.

33
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,750
I know you've been to the Imperial Study,

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,830
but this is the real imperial harem.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,320
Don't look around.

36
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,190
You might be accused of

37
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,360
being disrespectful and discourteous.

38
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,880
Madam, you know Consort Yi?

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,000
She's my cousin.

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,750
The imperial family has been gracious to my family.

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,600
Then why do you marry my dad?

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,520
For what?

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,880
Whatever makes me happy!

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,800
I see. For love.

45
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,270
Don't be too arrogant when you see Her Highness later.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,030
I see. I should save your face.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,550
Consort Yi is the birth mother of the Third Prince.

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,670
Don't be disrespectful.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,550
Isn't the Crown Prince the third eldest among the princes?

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,750
According to the tradition of our dynasty,

51
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,440
the Crown Prince won't be included

52
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,670
when ranking other princes.

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,750
Though Consort Yi's son is still a kid,

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,000
he's the Third Prince.

55
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,960
That means

56
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,600
the Crown Prince doesn't deserve to

57
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,720
have any family or brother.

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,000
How dare you say that?

59
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,000
Madam, how long has it been

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,750
since you last saw Consort Yi?

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
It's been four years.

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,720
It's so long!

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,720
After she married into the imperial family,

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,190
we seldom see each other.

65
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,960
Is Consort Yi cold by nature?

66
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,520
Big and profound as the Liu family,

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,910
if we visit Consort Yi frequently,

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,190
we might be suspected of collusion.

69
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,880
In this sense,

70
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,750
the palace walls actually become her cage.

71
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,960
Indeed.

72
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,240
How hard-hearted are you

73
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,110
to leave me here

74
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,190
to rot by myself.

75
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,880
I actually have no one to talk to.

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,160
After all, the Liu family
is related to Your Highness by blood.

77
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,700
We should avoid suspicion.

78
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:03,800
=Consort Yi of Nanqing=
We should avoid suspicion.

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,440
=Consort Yi of Nanqing=
You belong to the Fan family now.

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,470
=Consort Yi of Nanqing=

81
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,740
=Consort Yi of Nanqing=
Why worry about this?

82
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,160
Why worry about this?

83
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,520
Aren't I here today?

84
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,830
Weren't it for Fan Xian's marriage

85
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,190
with Wan'er,

86
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,880
I wonder when could we

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,510
actually meet.

88
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,480
You must be Fan Xian.

89
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,550
Nephew Fan Xian pays respects to Auntie Liu.

90
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,640
Mr. Fan, you should call Your Highness.

91
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,950
You must be respectful.

92
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,720
He's really a good lad.

93
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,790
Fan Xian and others

94
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,440
have arrived in Consort Yi's palace.

95
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,640
Is Liu Ruyu with him?

96
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,670
Yes.

97
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Haven't seen her for years,

98
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,270
Consort Yi must be happy.

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,320
I heard that Fan Xian called Her Highness

100
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,880
Auntie Liu directly regardless of formalities.

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,110
Consort Yi smiled happily.

102
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,270
She hasn't sent him away

103
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,000
till now.

104
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,070
After seeing so many formalities,

105
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,270
one would long for family affection instead.

106
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
Fan Xian is really smart

107
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,230
by calling her that.

108
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,390
Who will he visit next?

109
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,880
I've already asked.

110
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,950
He will visit Imperial Consort Shu

111
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,830
and Lady Ning successively.

112
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,040
After the lunch,

113
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,830
the Empress Dowager will see him.

114
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,270
What about seizing the chance

115
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,510
and making Fan Xian run into

116
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,440
a maidservant when she's taking a bath?

117
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
How do you like that?

118
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm kidding.

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
It's too obvious. Nor is it interesting.

120
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,670
Send someone to follow him.

121
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,600
Tell me what he says.

122
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,760
Where's the Third Prince?

123
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,550
He's shy with strangers and dare not meet others.

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,950
I really don't know what to do.

125
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,110
When I was little,

126
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,790
the most important thing is to play.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,830
If I was asked to waste time

128
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,230
meeting strangers,

129
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,040
I wouldn't be happy, either.

130
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,350
You're really honest.

131
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,880
You might be

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,600
the first one

133
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
to say that.

134
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,000
Auntie Liu is really perceptive!

135
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,350
What a lad!

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,830
Your Highness,

137
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,110
Imperial Consort Shu and Lady Ning

138
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,070
are still waiting.

139
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,110
After the lunch,

140
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,670
the Empress Dowager also wants to see Mr. Fan.

141
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
Auntie Liu,

142
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,720
perhaps I should go over first.

143
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,040
We are relatives.

144
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll visit you often in future.

145
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,440
Go ahead.

146
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,070
You should stay

147
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,040
and talk with me.

148
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Well...

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,670
Fan Xian is the one they want to see.

150
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,640
Never mind.

151
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,070
Madam, stay with Auntie Liu.

152
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,920
I'll be fine.

153
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,760
Ruoruo, stay here, too.

154
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,640
Drink some tea and eat some snacks.

155
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll go with my brother.

156
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,070
Just be careful.

157
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,510
When you visit other consorts,

158
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
don't be so frivolous.

159
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,070
He's not frivolous.

160
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,950
I find him sincere instead.

161
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,880
You're fooled by him.

162
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,440
Now, we're going to Imperial Consort Shu's palace.

163
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,550
Imperial Consort Shu
is the birth mother of the Second Prince.

164
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,510
The Second Prince is funny.

165
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,600
I wonder what his mother would be like.

166
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,640
Among all the consorts,

167
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,230
Imperial Consort Shu is the most rigorous,

168
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,830
but I worry about her the least.

169
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,510
How so?

170
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,550
She won't be a problem for you.

171
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,320
Why?

172
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,350
Because you're talented.

173
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,760
My Lady, where's Mr. Fan?

174
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,070
He's over there.

175
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,720
Now I understand why

176
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,550
she's called Imperial Consort Shu.
('Shu' is a homophone for 'book' in Chinese)

177
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,440
What?

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,640
Nothing.

179
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,230
Mr. Fan,

180
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,230
take a seat, please.

181
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,230
Imperial Consort Shu will be here soon.

182
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,760
Your Highness!

183
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,070
=Imperial Consort Shu of Nanqing=

184
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,230
=Imperial Consort Shu of Nanqing=
Fan Xian is here.

185
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,860
=Imperial Consort Shu of Nanqing=

186
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,440
Take a seat.

187
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,520
Put this book on the second layer of

188
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,110
the second bookshelf on the left.

189
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
Your poem is good.

190
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,110
A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight.

191
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
Your Highness, I'm so flattered.

192
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,960
Have you opened a bookstore?

193
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,910
Yes.

194
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,030
Do you have any unique copies?

195
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
We only have novels.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No ancient books actually.

197
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,000
I heard that you wrote the Red Mansions.

198
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,960
Actually it was written

199
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,320
by Mr. Cao.

200
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,960
I read it by chance,

201
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,880
and copied it.

202
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,030
Who is he?

203
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,230
I've been collecting essays of ancient times.

204
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,400
How come I never heard of him?

205
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,640
Anyway, the book is really good.

206
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,400
Your Highness, I'm so flattered.

207
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,470
What have you been reading recently?

208
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,110
You publish the book.
I will take care of the network of shops.

209
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,790
And then we split the profit 40/60.

210
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,230
You get 60 and I get 40. What do you think?

211
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,030
The account books.

212
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,520
Business.

213
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
It's vulgar after all.

214
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,280
Your Highness, you're absolutely right.

215
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,150
Wan'er grew up in the imperial palace.

216
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,230
We all treat her as our daughter.

217
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,320
So I have to see you.

218
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,110
Chengze also speaks highly of you.

219
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,030
Who's Chengze?

220
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,440
Oh, it's the Second Prince.

221
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,520
My son is arrogant.

222
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,790
He seldom

223
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,960
praises others.

224
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,790
His Highness and I kind of hit it off

225
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,640
when we first met.

226
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,840
You're probably fooled by him.

227
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,880
He's shrewd and deep.

228
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
He never hits it off with others at first meeting.

229
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,000
I will say no more about him.

230
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,790
You'll see

231
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,350
after knowing him for a long time.

232
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,280
There's one thing

233
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,590
you probably don't know.

234
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,910
I

235
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,470
love reading.

236
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,710
I know. I know.

237
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,400
I already know that.

238
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,150
You're a younger member of the family.

239
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,710
I should give you presents

240
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,790
for your visit.

241
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,080
I'm never fond of vulgar things.

242
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,150
So I'll give you some ancient books and unique copies.

243
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,590
But I don't know what you like.

244
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,280
Actually, I...

245
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,760
Yet, even if you tell me what you want,

246
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,790
I might be unwilling to give them to you.

247
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,000
Just let me pick some books

248
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,350
for you.

249
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,590
That's fine.

250
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
It won't be convenient for you to hold the books.

251
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll have them sent to Consort Yi's palace.

252
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,910
Take them when you leave. OK?

253
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,590
Your Highness, you're so considerate.

254
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,150
Do you have anything else?

255
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,520
Well. Well. Well.

256
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,710
Then I'll see myself out.

257
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,150
This way.

258
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,320
OK. OK.

259
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,710
I didn't expect that

260
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,110
Her Highness is so different from

261
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,880
the Second Prince.

262
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,230
Imperial Consort Shu is quietly elegant.

263
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,320
She doesn't talk much.

264
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,910
She only talks to you

265
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,400
because you're known as being talented.

266
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,760
I really couldn't keep up with

267
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,910
her sudden change of topic.

268
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,840
Next, we'll visit Lady Ning,

269
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,150
the birth mother of the First Prince.

270
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,670
By leading troops in the frontier fortress,

271
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
the First Prince owns the military power.

272
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,200
If he wants to become the Crown Prince,

273
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,350
won't he gain an upper hand?

274
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,110
Eunuch, it's fine.

275
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,280
No one will know if you don't tell.

276
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,150
You...

277
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,320
The First Prince won't do that,

278
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,670
and he can't.

279
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,080
Why?

280
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,030
Lady Ning is from Dongyi.

281
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,150
She was grabbed back by His
Majesty from a northern expedition.

282
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,550
Back then, His Majesty was injured in the battlefield.

283
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,150
By taking care of His Majesty day and night,

284
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,280
she was no longer a slave.

285
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,550
Later, she entered the imperial palace

286
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,760
and gave birth to the First Prince.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
So the First Prince

288
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,280
is of mixed-blood.

289
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,200
Therefore,

290
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,760
he can't inherit the throne.

291
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,670
That's also why the Empress Dowager

292
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,150
doesn't like Lady Ning.

293
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,910
She was originally an Imperial Consort.

294
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,150
Years ago,

295
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,440
something happened,

296
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,000
and she was deprived of her rank

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,960
and demoted to Lady.

298
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,980
The old lady is quite narrow-minded.

299
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,640
Mr. Fan,

300
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,760
I've not lived long enough!

301
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,960
Eunuch, don't worry.

302
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,440
I won't say that in front of

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
the Empress Dowager.

304
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,670
Mr. Fan,

305
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,440
don't even think about that.

306
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,280
You should mind your words all the time.

307
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,280
There are so many old ladies.

308
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,030
Who knows I'm talking about the Empress Dowager?

309
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,670
=Lady Ning of Nanqing=

310
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,220
=Lady Ning of Nanqing=
Are you Fan Xian?

311
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,760
Are you Fan Xian?

312
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes, Your Highness.

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,880
You have no beard.

314
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,550
What?

315
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,550
Your arms are not strong enough.

316
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,790
You actually

317
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,470
killed Cheng Jushu!

318
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,200
He was an Eighth Dan martial arts master.

319
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,110
I don't buy it.

320
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,200
Your Highness,

321
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,790
we fought on the streets.

322
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,910
Many people have seen us.

323
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,080
You should be more robust.

324
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,200
Rougher.

325
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,000
Anyway, you shouldn't

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,840
be like this.

327
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,880
Fine.

328
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,710
Since Wan'er likes you,

329
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,550
then so be it.

330
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,960
That's it?

331
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,470
Right!

332
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,000
We just want to see you today.

333
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,880
Satisfied or not,

334
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,030
it's up to Wan'er.

335
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,640
Your Highness, you're really sensible.

336
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,280
Well. Just leave.

337
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,550
Your Highness,

338
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,710
the Empress Dowager

339
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,030
wants to see Fan Xian after lunch.

340
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,150
Go ahead. I'm not holding him back.

341
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,230
Well.

342
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,280
Look, it's not early now.

343
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,550
So you're here for lunch.

344
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,960
No, I don't. I dare not.

345
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,110
Take a seat, too.

346
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,350
I dare not.

347
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,400
You don't have to mind those rules

348
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,150
in my place.

349
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,110
Humble as I am,

350
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,080
I really dare not!

351
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,880
Whatever.

352
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,880
I've long heard that

353
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,030
Fan Jian's daughter is both beautiful and talented.

354
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,320
Are you engaged?

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
Not yet.

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,790
I have a son

357
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,640
who's rather straightforward.

358
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,280
Do you want to meet him when he's back?

359
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,880
I haven't thought about that yet.

360
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,590
No need to be nervous.

361
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,470
I won't push you.

362
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Come one. Let's eat!

363
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,960
Where's the staple food?

364
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,910
Serve the staple food.

365
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,790
Your Highness, I don't need the staple food.

366
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,080
It's for your brother.

367
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,080
It's too much.

368
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,590
No need to hold back.

369
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,520
To practice martial arts, you must eat more.

370
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,400
I'm not holding back.

371
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,880
Eat it. Fill another bowl if it's not enough.

372
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,110
Come on. Taste the meat.

373
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,670
Come on.

374
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,030
Such a big bowl of rice!

375
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,350
Did he finish it all?

376
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,640
He left a lot.

377
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,880
Don't you find him

378
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,320
interesting?

379
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,150
If Your Highness think so,

380
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,520
then he's interesting.

381
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,470
By the way,

382
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,960
I'm the mother of Wan'er.

383
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,520
Now that he's in the imperial palace,

384
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,440
why doesn't he come to visit me?

385
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,790
Your Highness, you forgot.

386
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,790
You said yourself that you don't want to

387
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,910
see him for fear that you might be bored.

388
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,280
But now I think

389
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,590
it might be interesting to see him.

390
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,070
Is he still in Lady Ning's palace?

391
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
Now he must have arrived in

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,710
the Empress Dowager's palace.

393
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,800
I want to see him.

394
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,710
Wait!

395
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,590
Fan Xian can't be the only one

396
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,640
to have fun.

397
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,470
Ask Xiaoyi over.

398
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,590
Yes.

399
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,160
Ask him to bring his bow and arrows.

400
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,230
Have you remembered the route?

401
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,880
I've remembered the route from the entrance gate

402
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,160
to the Empress Dowager's palace.

403
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,590
Draw a map when we go back.

404
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,400
Mr. Fan,

405
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,710
you may kneel down here.

406
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,560
Let the Empress Dowager see you.

407
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,310
Kneel down here?

408
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,430
Yes.

409
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,110
Without entering the palace?

410
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,680
It's the Empress Dowager's order. Just kneel down.

411
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,800
I've never knelt down before His Majesty.

412
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,040
Just kneel down.

413
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,310
Fine.

414
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,110
I'm just showing respect to the old.

415
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,110
The Empress Dowager only asks Mr. Fan to kneel down.

416
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,190
I'll keep my brother company.

417
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,830
Can Her Majesty see me

418
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,280
kneeling down here?

419
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,710
Who's that?

420
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Mind your words.

421
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,880
It's Eunuch Hong.

422
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,160
Who are the Four Great Masters?

423
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,000
Nanqing has two Great Masters.

424
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,920
One is Liuyun Palm Ye Liuyun.

425
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,830
The other is mysterious and unknown.

426
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,950
Rumor has it that he is hidden

427
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,470
in the imperial palace of the capital city.

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,920
There's other speculation that

429
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,880
he is an old eunuch

430
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,700
in the imperial palace.

431
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:06,710
=Hong Sixiang, Head of Eunuchs of Nanqing=
in the imperial palace.

432
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,500
=Hong Sixiang, Head of Eunuchs of Nanqing=

433
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,880
The Empress Dowager said

434
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,710
you shouldn't kneel down for respecting the old.

435
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,800
You're kneeling down here because as an official,

436
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,920
you should show respect to the imperial family.

437
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,350
The Empress Dowager also said

438
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,520
next time you see His Majesty,
you'd better kneel down before him.

439
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,230
Can she hear me inside...

440
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,160
You could hear me, right?

441
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,280
You'd better mind your words

442
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,350
and behaviors inside the imperial palace.

443
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,950
Not everyone has a good hearing

444
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,350
as you do.

445
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,680
The Empress Dowager asked me to tell you.

446
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,430
Treat Wan'er nicely.

447
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,280
If you ever make her sad,

448
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,640
you'll have to die for that.

449
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,040
Eunuch Hong, please tell Her Majesty that

450
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,000
her words might

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,070
have the exactly opposite effect.

452
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,430
They'll keep others

453
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,760
away from Wan'er instead.

454
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,880
Are you scared?

455
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,350
I'll treat Wan'er nicely

456
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,070
because I love her wholeheartedly.

457
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,520
I'll protect her

458
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,920
no matter what Her Majesty said.

459
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,590
I hope you can remember your own words.

460
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,070
Escort him out the imperial palace.

461
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Eunuch Hong,

462
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,590
are you a Great Master?

463
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,230
That kid is unwilling to submit.

464
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,110
But he said

465
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,350
he'll treat Wan'er nicely
because he loves her wholeheartedly.

466
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,470
I think he means it.

467
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,880
How long

468
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,950
can love last?

469
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,680
Your Majesty, won't you meet him?

470
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,160
Among the younger generation,

471
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,830
he's a smart one.

472
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,160
I've seen him from a distance,

473
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,000
but I don't like him.

474
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,070
Why?

475
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,400
I can't tell.

476
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,640
I just feel that

477
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,920
I had seen him somewhere.

478
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,160
Your Majesty, that's impossible.

479
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,070
Right.

480
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,830
It might be fate.

481
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,920
Just let him go.

482
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,110
Luckily, everything goes on smoothly today.

483
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,640
Mr. Fan,

484
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,110
after today,

485
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,680
there won't be any obstacles

486
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,000
for your marriage with the princess.

487
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,110
I'll congratulate you in advance

488
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,560
for good luck and happiness.

489
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,590
Well, you...

490
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,640
I really mean to congratulate you.

491
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,590
And I really mean to thank you.

492
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,310
Then I'll take it.

493
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,590
The Princess Royal wants to see Fan Xian.

494
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,310
No one has told me in advance.

495
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,350
Her Highness didn't want to see him then,

496
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
but now she wants to see him.

497
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,590
Well...

498
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,110
I'm here for Wan'er,

499
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,070
so I definitely should visit Her Highness.

500
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,280
Please lead the way.

501
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,190
Her Highness only wants to see you.

502
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,470
They should wait for you

503
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,190
in Consort Yi's palace.

504
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,280
Brother.

505
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,280
Please.

506
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,800
What?

507
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,680
The Princess Royal wants to see Fan Xian alone!

508
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,950
He should visit her.

509
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,110
After all, she's the birth mother of Wan'er.

510
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,430
Is there anything wrong?

511
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,920
The Princess Royal appears to be

512
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,520
soft and delicate in the imperial palace.

513
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
However...

514
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,880
However what?

515
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,040
However, if you know her for a long time,

516
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,590
you'll feel there's something hidden

517
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,920
under her appearance.

518
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,710
What does that mean?

519
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,190
It's just like

520
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,590
there's an alter ego deep down her heart,

521
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,950
repressed and roaring silently

522
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,880
all the time.

523
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,560
Though the roar can't be heard,

524
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,520
it makes you nervous.

525
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,920
When you stand with her,

526
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,350
you're afraid that the beast in her heart

527
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,160
might break free any time.

528
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,920
I'll get my brother back.

529
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,070
Wait!

530
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,160
That's too rude.

531
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,590
Maybe I was wrong.

532
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
No need to panic.

533
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,280
Don't worry.

534
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,000
Nothing like that can happen in the imperial palace.

535
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,070
Her Highness is waiting for you inside.

536
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,110
Mr. Fan, please.

537
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,560
Fan Xian pays respects

538
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,110
to Your Highness.

539
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,920
I heard you're a student of Fei Jie

540
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,350
and your medial skills are marvelous.

541
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,950
Now, Wan'er is also

542
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,920
getting better.

543
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,160
I just happen to know some folk prescriptions.

544
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,230
Do you have any folk prescription for headache?

545
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,000
Headache has many causes.

546
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,590
My teacher also found it a headache

547
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,040
to explain them to me.

548
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,310
Isn't there any good method?

549
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,830
I actually learned

550
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,830
massage from my teacher.

551
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,520
It might relieve the pain.

552
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,880
Try it on me.

553
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,590
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

554
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,230
Mr. Fan, you're so old-fashioned.

555
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,880
In a few days,

556
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
you'll become my son-in-law.

557
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,280
What are you afraid of?

558
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,190
I'll certainly obey the order

559
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,520
from the elder.

560
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,280
Have you started?

561
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,760
Have you also learned the technique

562
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,800
from Fei Jie?

563
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,110
The acupoint recognition method
is also taught by my teacher.

564
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,110
I do feel much relieved.

565
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,800
It's mainly for promoting blood circulation.

566
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,400
Insufficient blood supply to the brain

567
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,560
might also cause headache.

568
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,470
When did Fei Jie teach you?

569
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,560
When I was little.

570
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,310
I didn't expect that

571
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,070
the Fan family is so close with

572
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,640
the Investigator's Office.

573
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,000
Perhaps only my father and teacher

574
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,190
are close.

575
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,000
They did know each other back then.

576
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,880
By the way.

577
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,830
How's your grandma in Danzhou?

578
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,400
She's in good health.

579
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Good for her.

580
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,800
Back then, I loved your grandma the most.

581
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,190
I loved to follow her all the time.

582
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,280
My grandma is always protective.

583
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,160
I heard you've opened a bookstore.

584
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,000
Danbo Bookstore.

585
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,190
Just a small business.

586
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,350
It's safer than being an official in the imperial court.

587
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,520
The Niulan Street assassination

588
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,560
must have scared you.

589
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,560
I remember it all the time.

590
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,640
I heard your guard was killed.

591
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,640
His name is Teng Zijing.

592
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,710
He's not only my guard,

593
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,190
but my friend.

594
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,190
Separation in life or death is inevitable.

595
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,470
Your Highness, you're absolutely right.

596
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,430
Did I say anything funny?

597
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,400
No! No!

598
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,760
I just found those words

599
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,160
so funny.

600
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,680
How?

601
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,470
The person planned the assassination

602
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,520
was actually comforting the target.

603
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,230
Isn't that funny?

604
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,520
The Niulan Street assassination

605
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,590
was planned by me.

606
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,880
That is to say,

607
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,640
your friend was killed

608
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,470
because of me.

609
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,920
Isn't that funny?

610
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,920
Why do you stop?

611
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,950
Did you plan it all by yourself?

612
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,230
You want to know whether the
Crown Prince was involved or not.

613
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,830
Well.

614
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,230
Though I support the Crown Prince,

615
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,160
I won't tell him everything.

616
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,800
Lin Gong pledged allegiance to me secretly.

617
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,640
The Crown Prince knew nothing about that.

618
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,680
By the way,

619
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,350
Lin Gong was very obedient.

620
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,430
It's a pity he died so young.

621
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
I heard you want to

622
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,040
avenge your guard's death.

623
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,760
His name is Teng Zijing.

624
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,710
No need to remember

625
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,280
the name of a dead man.

626
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,040
Will you avenge his death?

627
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,190
Now there's no one here

628
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,160
in the Guangxin Palace.

629
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,470
Whatever you want to do,

630
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,350
you can do it.

631
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,830
Why are you hesitating?

632
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,160
Aren't you seeking revenge

633
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,400
all the time?

634
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,350
Are you intimidated by

635
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,880
my status?

636
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,640
Or

637
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,470
did your friend die in vain

638
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,590
after all?

639
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,000
I missed an acupoint just now.

640
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,350
Do you feel better now?

641
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,680
You're really good at massaging.

642
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,520
Now I'm just

643
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,830
slightly uncomfortable.

644
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,310
Then I'll massage you a little longer.

645
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,400
Your Highness, I want to thank you.

646
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,400
Thank me?

647
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,830
Thank me for trying to kill you?

648
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,760
Thank you for clearing my doubts.

649
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,430
Till today,

650
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,680
I finally know

651
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,560
who wants to kill me.

652
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,000
You're welcome.

653
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,590
By the way,

654
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,950
the assassination in Danzhou...

655
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,800
It was also me.

656
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:38,950
Was it because you were afraid that

657
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,280
I might take over the Neiku?

658
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,680
At first, it was.

659
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,640
What about later?

660
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,160
Later I found you

661
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,760
so interesting.

662
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,160
It's fun to kill

663
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,560
someone interesting, right?

664
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,590
Your Highness, you are really perceptive.

665
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,110
I also find myself interesting.

666
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,920
Just now,

667
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,800
why didn't you kill me?

668
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,640
I wanted to.

669
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,280
Then why not?

670
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,640
Your Highness, I'll make you a bet.

671
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,280
Go ahead.

672
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,520
If I tried to kill you,

673
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,040
now I would be

674
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,760
a dead man.

675
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,520
Am I right?

676
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,110
Well, get out.

677
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,070
How smart you are!

678
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,880
I find you more interesting.

679
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,040
If Your Highness have nothing else for me,

680
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,190
I shall leave now.

681
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,070
If there had been no one ambushing just now,

682
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,950
would you kill me?

683
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,310
Take it easy.

684
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,680
The day is yet to come.

685
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,830
Your Highness will know the answer

686
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,400
to the question sooner or later.

687
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,190
I'm waiting.

688
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,590
I'll see myself out.

689
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,680
Interesting.

690
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,110
Director Yan, nice to see you again.

691
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,110
We'll meet again.

692
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,110
Master Zhuang is here.

693
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,310
Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang!

694
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,110
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

695
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,070
Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang!

696
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,640
Master Zhuang, take me as your student!

697
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,430
Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang!

698
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,190
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

699
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,110
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

700
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,080
Don't push! Step aside!

701
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,360
Master Zhuang!

702
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,760
Take me as your student! Take me as your student!

703
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,230
Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang!

704
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,600
Step aside! Step aside!

705
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,040
Step aside!

706
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,800
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

707
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,280
Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang!

708
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,600
The Beiqi mission has arrived in the capital city.

709
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,040
Zhuang Mohan is among them.

710
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,230
Many scholars

711
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,710
from the capital city

712
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,390
rushed to the gate to welcome him.

713
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,230
Scholars around the world

714
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,840
honor Zhuang Mohan as their teacher.

715
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,150
His visit this time

716
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,710
might affect

717
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,950
the negotiation.

718
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,430
The negotiation is up to His Majesty.

719
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:45,040
A scholar won't make a difference.

720
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,430
Anything else?

721
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,840
Head,

722
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,360
in recent days, secret forces
have been formed inside the Investigator's Office.

723
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,320
I was tipped off that

724
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,430
a lot of people want to

725
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
sabotage this negotiation.

726
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,710
They want to restart the war

727
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,280
so as to defeat Beiqi at one stroke.

728
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,910
Head, you're really perceptive.

729
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,080
The First Division

730
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,430
should take care of the things
happened in the capital city. Watch out closely.

731
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,320
What if our colleagues

732
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,670
are involved in the conspiracy?

733
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,280
When the state is concerned,

734
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,760
we should be impartial.

735
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,320
I understand.

736
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,150
The Beiqi mission has arrived.

737
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,600
If the Court of State Ceremonials

738
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,390
really negotiates with them,

739
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,910
our plan to unify the whole world

740
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,320
will be postponed indefinitely.

741
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,870
No need to panic.

742
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,360
If members of the mission are killed in the capital city,

743
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,080
the negotiation certainly won't proceed.

744
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,470
Beiqi can send other members to replace the dead ones.

745
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,390
Now that Beiqi is defeated again and again,

746
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,320
it dares not

747
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,120
start any war.

748
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,870
What if Zhuang Mohan, the teacher of all scholars,

749
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,520
is killed in the capital city?

750
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,390
If Zhuang Mohan is killed,

751
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,520
then the war is inevitable.

752
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,390
His Majesty will have to send troops

753
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,390
to defeat Beiqi at one stroke.

754
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,870
By then,

755
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,470
your son can

756
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,870
return from the capital of Beiqi

757
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,360
and get rid of danger.

758
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,320
What I do

759
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,800
is not for saving my son,

760
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,760
but for the grand cause of Nanqing

761
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,280
which will last for generations.

762
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,080
So one day, we can see the world

763
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,080
unified as a whole.

764
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,600
Your Excellency, you are really

765
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,760
righteous and loyal.

766
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,150
The Princess Royal admitted!

767
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,390
Now looking back, it's all connected.

768
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,190
Li Yunrui neither wanted me

769
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,870
to come to the capital city to marry Wan'er,

770
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,040
nor wanted me to

771
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,080
take over the Neiku.

772
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,910
So she passed on a fake order to the Investigator's Office

773
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,430
to kill me in Danzhou.

774
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,470
But you were not killed.

775
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,840
So she tried to kill you again

776
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,470
on Niulan Street.

777
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,150
Now if she tries to kill me once more,

778
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,080
it's not merely for benefits.

779
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,950
Then for what?

780
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,560
The Prime Minister is right about one thing.

781
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,840
Isn't the Princess Royal

782
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,000
the birth mother of Wan'er?

783
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,430
That woman

784
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,600
is crazy.

785
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,520
If she's normal,

786
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
she wouldn't tell me the truth.

787
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
Nor would she use her own life as bait

788
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,950
to lure me into killing her.

789
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,080
She is

790
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,560
indeed crazy!

791
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,840
Crazy?

792
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,950
Isn't it easier

793
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,390
to deal with a lunatic?

794
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,280
She's different.

795
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,800
The crazier she is, the more dangerous she will be.

796
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,040
Shall we tell His Majesty about her?

797
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,870
It won't work.

798
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,910
We don't have any proof.

799
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,600
Even if she admitted herself,

800
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,080
we don't have other witnesses.

801
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,230
Then what can we do?

802
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,080
If we want to defeat the Princess Royal,

803
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,870
we must be patient.

804
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,950
We'd better focus on what we should do now.

805
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,840
Do you still remember the route to the Imperial Harem?

806
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,000
Yes.

807
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,190
Draw it down.

808
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,840
Younger Master Fan Xian,

809
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,080
Master wants to see you in his study.

810
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,840
Just keep drawing.

811
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,120
I'll go to see him.

812
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,040
-You want to see me? -Your Excellency Fan!

813
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,080
=Xin Qiwu, Deputy Chief of Court of State Ceremonials=

814
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,620
Your Excellency Fan!
=Xin Qiwu, Deputy Chief of Court of State Ceremonials=

815
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,040
Your Excellency Fan!

816
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,870
I've long heard your reputation as a talented youth.

817
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,120
Now I finally meet you.

818
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,150
You're really young and outstanding.

819
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,600
Look at you! Look at you!

820
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,910
You do have an imposing appearance.

821
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,870
Who are you?

822
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,080
I am Xin Qiwu,

823
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,230
Deputy Chief of Court of State Ceremonials.

824
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,670
Court of State Ceremonials?

825
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,670
Right!

826
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,670
Your Excellency,

827
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,470
now we're colleagues

828
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,390
in Court of State Ceremonials.

829
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,230
We should look after each other.

830
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,080
Well. Well.

831
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,280
Aren't I the Chief Musician of Court of Imperial Sacrifices?

832
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,150
Your Excellency, from now on,

833
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,320
you're a member of Court of State Ceremonials.

834
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,390
You're sent to work in Court of
State Ceremonials for the moment.

835
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,430
It's of great importance.

836
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,710
You should be careful about it.

837
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,800
About what?

838
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,630
Your Excellency may not know.

839
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,630
Missions from Beiqi and Dongyi

840
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,600
have arrived in the capital city.

841
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,950
I know that.

842
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,150
Beiqi is here to make peace.

843
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,080
Dongyi is here to make an apology.

844
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,910
How is that relevant to me?

845
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,040
As for the negotiation between
Beiqi mission and our country,

846
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,190
Your Excellency is the Deputy Receptionist, right?

847
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,150
Me?

848
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,670
Right, it's you!

849
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,150
His Majesty has issued an imperial edict.

850
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,360
How can that be false?

851
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,630
So I rushed here

852
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,870
to escort Your Excellency

853
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,910
to Court of State Ceremonials.

854
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's go

855
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,320
and get prepared.

856
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,870
It's true.

857
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,660
=Court of State Ceremonials=

858
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,080
Your Excellency, please! Your Excellency, please!

859
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,360
Your Excellency, look!

860
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,430
In a few days,

861
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,360
we'll negotiate with

862
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,430
Beiqi mission here.

863
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,360
By then, we'll count on

864
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,320
your elegant demeanor.

865
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,950
Wait a moment!

866
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,120
I'm still confused about

867
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,150
the whole thing.

868
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,630
What are you confused about?

869
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,320
I have no experience in negotiating.

870
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,040
Why am I chosen?

871
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,950
Well. Well.

872
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,800
You certainly

873
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,390
know the answer.

874
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,280
Behave yourself!

875
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,560
Because the Crown Prince

876
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,630
and the Prime Minister recommended you.

877
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,280
The Crown Prince and the Prime Minister?

878
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,390
Right. They tried so hard

879
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,360
to help you build

880
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,230
a good name successively.

881
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,320
Well, Your Excellency,

882
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,600
if there's anything wrong,

883
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,000
please feel free to tell me.

884
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,600
I will help you out.

885
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,670
Your Excellency Xin,

886
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,080
you're a fourth rank official,
while I'm an eighth rank official,

887
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,670
but you call me "Your Excellency" all the time.

888
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,950
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

889
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,840
Well, there's a saying that

890
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,630
man's will does not depend on his official rank.

891
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,950
Is there?

892
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,430
Yes, of course.

893
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,000
Young and competent

894
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,840
as you are,

895
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,080
plus the support of the Crown
Prince and the Prime Minister,

896
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,910
your prospect

897
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,080
is beyond measure.

898
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,320
In addition,

899
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,320
I want to tell you a secret.

900
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,710
I'm also a follower of the Crown Prince.

901
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,800
I don't know myself that

902
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,910
I'm a follower of the Crown Prince.

903
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,630
Your Excellency, stop it!

904
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,870
You're making fun of me

905
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,560
again.

906
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,230
If you're not a follower of His Highness,

907
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,800
why would he think so highly of you?

908
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,000
We'd better talk about

909
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,910
the negotiation.

910
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,360
OK.

911
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,320
Your Excellency, here's the thing.

912
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,190
There's someone named Zhuang Mohan

913
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,230
in the Beiqi mission.

914
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,560
You can treat anyone

915
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,080
unfriendly

916
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,800
but him.

917
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,600
Zhuang Mohan?

918
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,150
What are you looking at?

919
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Look at that cloud!

920
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,430
You're so relaxed and carefree today.

921
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,360
Doesn't it look like a pile of silver?

922
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,190
That's definitely your style.

923
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,360
What if

924
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,390
I took all the silver back home?

925
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,190
How happy my wife and daughter

926
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,630
would be!

927
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,080
Are we going back to the Fan mansion?

928
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,630
Wang Qinian,

929
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,470
have you ever heard of Zhuang Mohan?

930
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,460
In the river of history,

931
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,660
time goes round and round.

932
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,020
Memories about the former and present lives

933
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,900
join each other in an endless way.

934
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,500
In the long drunken Milky Way,

935
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,220
one season follows another in a flash,

936
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,420
and the wild geese are flying south.

937
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,340
I just can't give up

938
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,340
to be with you for my whole life.

939
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,620
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

940
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,420
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

941
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,300
Year after year in the wandering,

942
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,860
I count the remaining years.

943
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,060
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

944
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,620
even though we have ended up the destiny,

945
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,300
I never feel regretful.

946
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,260
In such a chaotic world,

947
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,020
I still miss you as ever.

948
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,660
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

949
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,380
With a gentle heart,

950
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,940
I cherish our remaining years.

951
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,780
Even though we have to go through

952
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,740
all the hardships along the journey,

953
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:36,060
you always stay by my side,

954
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,820
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

955
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,740
Year after year in the wandering,

956
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,100
I count the remaining years.

957
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,460
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

958
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,260
even though we end up the destiny,

959
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,700
I never feel regretful.

960
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,620
In such a chaotic world,

961
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,580
I still miss you as ever.

962
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,260
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

963
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,020
With a gentle heart,

964
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,420
I cherish our remaining years.

965
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,220
Even though we have to go through

966
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,380
all the hardships along the journey,

967
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:16,660
you always stay by my side...
