1
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,330
Game set!

2
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,810
Winner: Oumi!

3
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,710
I am yet again watching him from afar

4
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,960
as he refreshingly executes his smashes.

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,880
It's a secret that I'm dating him.

6
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,140
Oumi is the most handsome guy in my year,

7
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,630
and we're keeping it a secret
from everyone that I'm dating him.

8
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,910
Hey, Oumi! I baked cookies for you.

9
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,280
What? For me?

10
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,940
Thanks.

11
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,710
Or so I say.

12
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,730
There's no way someone
like me could be dating Oumi.

13
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,700
Oh? The ball sports tournament
is coming up soon, right?

14
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,530
Yes, that's right.
Will you be joining?

15
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,190
I will be.

16
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,390
You promise?! We'll be watching!

17
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,470
My relationship with Oumi,
the one I admire,

18
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,100
'An account where I tweet my daily fantasies'

19
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,100
I am yet again watching him from afar as
he refreshingly executes his smashes.
It's a secret that I'm dating him #noboyfriend

20
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,100
As he says, 'you pervert',
there's a slight smile on his lips.
He is such a cutie! #noboyfriend

21
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,300
is only in my imagination.

22
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,800
As someone who is at the
bottom of the love hierarchy,

23
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,840
experiencing real love is a
world that's way beyond me.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,860
That's why,

25
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,350
you need an abundant amount of imagination,

26
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,810
to find enjoyment in looking at
handsome guys that fit your type.

27
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,250
What's important is being able to
separate imagination from reality.

28
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,890
I don't even know how
Oumi really is like in real life...

29
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,380
What a drag.

30
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,060
Oh, it broke.

31
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,950
Oumi?

32
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,960
I don't need these handmade cookies.

33
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,830
Hey...

34
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,100
What?! So cruel!

35
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,770
Don't throw things you just received.

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,300
I can do whatever I want
with stuff I've gotten.

37
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,730
Now, you're being...

38
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,690
Oumi actually has such a
dark side to him?!

39
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,940
Hey!

40
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
Ichimura.

41
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,950
What?

42
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,430
I'm sorry! W-What should I do now?!

43
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,420
Are you okay?

44
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,000
Mr. Shiota!

45
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,600
Ex...

46
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,480
Ex...

47
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,280
EXCUSE ME!

48
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,320
Ichimura?

49
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,190
The fittings for the door has been loose
that's why I had to take this off.

50
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,460
Was she alright?

51
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,310
Such a side to him...

52
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,320
I wish I never knew about it!

53
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,020
Ichimura! I'm sorry.

54
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,430
We thought we were the last people
in the room so we turned off the lights.

55
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,020
Sorry. See you around, Nishimura.

56
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,940
See you.

57
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,510
See y...!

58
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,360
Hey, that's cute.

59
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,740
It's new.
- Wow, looks nice.

60
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,020
I'm glad you noticed.

61
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,820
Sometimes, there are days where
I feel like I'm invisible.

62
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,020
I wonder if I'll just keep going on
like this, unnoticed by anyone.

63
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,260
Bye, Oumi!

64
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,120
Bye.

65
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,080
Hey, are you alright?

66
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,960
Hey, wait, hold on. Why are you...?

67
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,870
What do you want?!

68
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,500
Here.

69
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,810
Crap!

70
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,920
Thank you so much!

71
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,560
This is... all about me, isn't it?

72
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,110
Ms. Lovesick Ellie.

73
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,020
"He refreshingly accepts
homemade cookies from the girls."

74
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,300
"But he says,
'You taste better than the cookies.'"

75
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,460
"Yum! Hurry up and get a taste."

76
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm so sorry! Please forget it!

77
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,120
Please let me off the hook!

78
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,920
It's alright.

79
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,460
I don't really want to ruin a girl's dream.

80
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,200
If you can keep it a secret
what you saw earlier,

81
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,790
I can make this fantasy of yours come true.

82
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,310
What?

83
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,760
You want me to do it, don't you?

84
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,730
Things like this.

85
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,190
No!

86
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,230
I just... I...!

87
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,750
Huh? Which is it then?

88
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,490
If you closed your eyes and shut up,
I could have left you with a good memory.

89
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,890
You keep blabbing. Just shut up.

90
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,350
He's like a completely different person!

91
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,500
Too bad for you.

92
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,630
I'm not the Oumi you oh-so-adore.

93
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,280
He's got a foul mouth.

94
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,370
He's acting cocky too!

95
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,350
Hey.

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,280
You lost the need to fantasize, didn't you?

97
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,000
But...

98
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,340
Go...

99
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,500
Go ahead!

100
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,030
What?

101
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,840
I fantasized about how we shared 294 kisses.

102
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,520
Well, I thought we could pull it off.

103
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,240
Hey, what's with you?

104
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,030
You're not too bad yourself.

105
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,370
What?

106
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,940
That brings me...

107
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,150
What you saw today, let's keep
it a secret between the two of us.

108
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,630
I trust you, pervert Ellie.

109
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,920
I saw my reflection in Oumi's eyes!

110
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,690
Who would have thought such
a miracle would happen to me?!

111
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,690
I am so glad to be alive!

112
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:37,280
Translations by FURRITSUBS

113
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,470
From that day on, my admiration
for Oumi faded away.

114
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,420
I've stopped muttering
about my fantasies too.

115
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,810
It's no big deal!

116
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,120
If that's the case, I just need
to increase my upload pace!

117
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,270
A forceful kiss from him.

118
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,590
He teases me at the last minute,
saying, "Why don't you want it?"

119
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,880
What a cheat!

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,200
#noboyfriend

121
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,900
Saying "What a drag," is his bad habit.

122
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,810
When I got uncertain,
feeling like he doesn't love me,

123
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,770
"Having to come see you
everyday is such a hassle."

124
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,700
"Why don't we move in already?" He says!

125
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,570
Gosh!

126
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,120
#noboyfriend

127
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,990
"Always lovey-dovey with your boyfriend, I see."

128
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,910
"Today's fantasy is exquisite like always!"

129
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,170
Sorry!

130
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,010
I'm sorry...

131
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,090
Oumi

132
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,200
Excuse me for the intrusion.

133
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
Are you in, Mr. Shiota?

134
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,390
Oumi!

135
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,950
If you're looking for Sumi,
he's in the Staff Room.

136
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,340
Sumi?

137
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,290
Sumi Shiota. He's my mom's younger brother.

138
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,440
What?

139
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,400
That means, Mr. Shiota is your uncle?

140
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,660
The only person in this school
who knows my true nature.

141
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,840
Don't tell anyone that I don't
really drink pure black coffee.

142
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,350
What's your deal, Ellie?

143
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,870
Nothing.

144
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,590
Hey...

145
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,320
Just to make sure I have the facts straight.

146
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,970
About what happened the other day,
you'll keep it a secret, won't you?

147
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,860
About Lovesick Ellie?

148
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,360
I'm begging you!
If anybody knew about that...

149
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,540
Its not something you need to hide.

150
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,910
Well, whatever floats.

151
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,060
By the way, your jersey...

152
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,300
What?

153
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,790
I saw a girl earlier who had your jersey.

154
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,290
So?

155
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
"So"?

156
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,530
Doesn't she need to give it back to you?

157
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,630
That happens a lot.

158
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,670
You really don't understand
a thing at all, do you?

159
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,540
With just one jersey,

160
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,620
do you even comprehend how
many things you can do with just that?!

161
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,580
You can smell it.

162
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,570
You can wear it.

163
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,130
You can hug it!

164
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,510
Poke, poke, poke.

165
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
What a powerful way of thinking...

166
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,440
Anyway, we need to get it back!

167
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,190
It's fine. Just leave it.

168
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,340
But...

169
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,770
I don't really give a damn.

170
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,130
It doesn't matter what
other people do.

171
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,330
But, if you talk---

172
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,730
There's no need!

173
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,820
I don't expect them to understand.

174
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,450
I don't wanna get involved with them.

175
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,170
How lonely you are...

176
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,820
I'm sorry!

177
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,400
This is none of your business.

178
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,740
I don't wanna hear that from someone
who gets satisfaction from their fantasies.

179
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,060
You're right.

180
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,360
You wouldn't want to hear that from me.

181
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,930
Oumi won't understand.

182
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,490
How an invisible person like me would feel.

183
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,720
It has nothing to do with me, huh?

184
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,810
Bye, Mr. Shiota.

185
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,820
Take care.

186
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,020
Ichimura.

187
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,060
Mr. Shiota.

188
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,050
I'm sorry for calling for you.

189
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,980
The Staff Head meeting dragged too long.

190
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,360
It's fine.

191
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,750
Actually, I'd like you to write
a review for next month's Book News.

192
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,920
You're asking me?

193
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,740
I heard you're good at writing.

194
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,720
I heard from Oumi.

195
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,020
What?

196
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,510
"She's got an amazing imagination,
and her choice of words is interesting,"

197
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,730
is what he said.

198
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,730
So, what you'll be reviewing is...

199
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,940
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,540
Excuse me!
- Ichimura?

201
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,380
Oumi actually saw through me.

202
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,390
And yet, I...

203
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,490
Hey!

204
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,660
That's Oumi's jersey, isn't it?

205
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,540
What's it to you?

206
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,300
Well...

207
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,520
Criticize me all you want then?

208
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,730
No! I just...

209
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,610
I'm jealous of you.

210
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,200
I can't even do that myself.

211
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,950
I'm not brave enough.

212
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm always fantasizing.

213
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,310
I'm someone who's satisfied
enough with just her imagination.

214
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,600
Truth is,

215
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,210
I want to touch him, smell him,
and feel him so close to me!

216
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,810
Yet I...

217
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,520
I caused myself to remain invisible.

218
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,980
That's why...

219
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,250
people who can take actions
are just amazing.

220
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,070
What are you saying?

221
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,380
Sorry but are you done?

222
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,150
Please wait!

223
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,300
No matter what your reasons were,
stealing isn't right at all!

224
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,070
Hey!

225
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,000
If you tell Oumi the truth,

226
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,960
he might even let you smell it a bit!

227
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,300
Hey, if you're shy about giving it back,

228
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,630
I'll come with you!

229
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,120
Oumi!

230
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,230
Come on!

231
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,310
Hurry and get away from him!

232
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,980
I'm so sorry!

233
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,480
I got my body in contact with Oumi's body...

234
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,940
Are you okay?

235
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,570
Did he touch you somewhere?!

236
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,930
What?

237
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,890
This is why real men are just...

238
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,720
You're not my fan?

239
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,690
Not in your wildest dreams!

240
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,090
I'm sorry for taking it
without your permission.

241
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,940
You have the ideal body.

242
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,440
I wanted to use your size as a
reference when making clothes.

243
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,560
Clothes?

244
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,720
Mr. Michael. Isn't he splendid?

245
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,600
I fell in love at first sight with him.

246
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,030
I really want him to wear
the clothes I make!

247
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,040
But only in my imagination.

248
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,340
I can relate!

249
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,300
I'm also having fun making Oumi wear
all sorts of different outfits in my head.

250
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,700
Right?!

251
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,580
Like western school uniform,
a suit, or a kimono.

252
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,570
Or a swimwear as well?

253
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,740
Swimwear is a good one!

254
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,030
I should try making one too!

255
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,560
Please do!

256
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,480
Swimwear? Sounds great!

257
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,430
I get you!

258
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,900
These two are crazy.

259
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,620
Just to tell you,

260
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,240
I didn't tell you to get this back to me.

261
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,260
I told you, I don't care
what other people do.

262
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,520
You and I have nothing to do with each other---

263
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,810
We do!

264
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,290
I know.

265
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,260
You're not actually cold-hearted.

266
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,570
I won't be deceived by you!

267
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,420
Are you an idiot?

268
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,940
My bad.

269
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,780
Well anyway, I got my jersey back.

270
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,440
I'll give you a reward.

271
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,020
What?

272
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,420
Of course, in Ellie's delusional version,
as your beloved Oumi.

273
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,090
If it's a reward,

274
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
I don't want the fantasy version.

275
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,040
I want it from the real you, Oumi.

276
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,730
Foul-mouthed, with the arrogant attitude.

277
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,590
From the Oumi who smiles like a kid.

278
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,330
Spoiling a perverted extreme
masochist isn't my style.

279
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,350
Be satisfied with this.

280
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,830
What is this? Hey!

281
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
How is it?

282
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,070
You're happy, aren't you?

283
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,290
In bliss.

284
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,510
Hey!

285
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,360
Wait!

286
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,740
Oumi?

287
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,490
Gotta ask.

288
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,180
Are you prepared for me to love you?

289
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,000
That's...

290
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,380
Does... Does that mean...!

291
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,440
Time's up.

292
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,740
You ran out of time.

293
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,380
What?

294
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,110
You took so long to reply so no.

295
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,190
Bye.

296
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,440
Was he just teasing me?

297
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
But...

298
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,840
I took a whiff of the scent of his jersey!

299
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,650
A whiff!

300
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,560
I took a whiff!

301
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,600
I TOOK A WHIFF!

302
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:26,630
You can do infinite things with a jersey!

303
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,260
#thepervertcheers!

304
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,160
#noboyfriend

305
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,810
Am I prepared to be loved?

306
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,930
I'm sure he's just teasing me.

307
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,150
That's kinda complicated.

308
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,030
Hey...

309
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,050
Who are you?

310
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,770
What?

311
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,120
I forgot.

312
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,060
My childhood friend Leo.
He's a year older.

313
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,920
He's like the poop of a goldfish.

314
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,620
He'll keep following you,
but don't worry about it.

315
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,020
I am a bodyguard who will
protect my beloved Sara.

316
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,380
Nice to meet you, Elliechin!

317
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,270
Here you go, Sara!

318
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,180
Nice to meet you.

319
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,940
Oumi says things that'll lead you on.

320
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,970
He's playing around with your feelings.

321
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,540
I'm pretty sure he's taking it seriously.

322
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,470
What?

323
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,740
You wouldn't say something like that
to a woman you don't care about, right?

324
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,030
Leo, don't say anything unnecessary
that'll confuse her!

325
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,750
Anyone who is so used to being around
women is bound to do that, right?

326
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,090
What? Is that so?

327
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,120
Of course.
- I don't think so.

328
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,170
She's right.

329
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,270
I'm glad I didn't take it seriously.

330
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,830
Everyone's trying to doll
themselves up just to see Oumi.

331
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,850
What?

332
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,390
Oumi!

333
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,770
Don't wanna get exposed.

334
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,330
What's wrong?

335
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,540
Wanna go home with me?

336
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,710
What?

337
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,100
Hurry and answer or forget it.

338
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,640
Well...

339
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,710
Someone asked me to fill in for them
today at the beautification committee.

340
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,570
Was it pushed on you?

341
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,160
Then, I'll walk home with you tomorrow.

342
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,690
Tomorrow, I made plans to meet Sara...

343
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,750
Oh, really?

344
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,630
Sorry!

345
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Doesn't matter.

346
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,250
You dummy.

347
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,280
Oumi! Wait! Wait for us!

348
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,940
I'm sure he was just
teasing me again, wasn't he?

349
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,020
But...

350
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,190
If that time...

351
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,800
Gotta ask.

352
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,360
Are you prepared for me to love you?

353
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,370
Of course.

354
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,440
If only I answered that then...

355
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,490
If that's the case, don't go
home with other guys but me.

356
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,280
Be mine only, Ellie.

357
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,640
That would have been the next scene!

358
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,800
Ichimura!

359
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,800
Yes!

360
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,370
You handle this area with Kaname.

361
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,000
Alright!

362
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,650
Let's do the schoolyard next!

363
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,840
Alright.

364
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,630
Ichimura, you're not a member of the
beautification committee, are you?

365
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,200
Yes, I was only tasked to do it today.

366
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,610
There are actually people who'd ask
others to do such a troublesome task?

367
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,810
Well, I guess it's because
I always have leisure time.

368
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,400
Really? So you're free?

369
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,820
It takes 1 minute to repot one potted plant.

370
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,880
Since we have 30 pieces,

371
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,190
I think it'll take about 45 minutes
in total, including time to clean up.

372
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,870
If you have that much time,
then I guess it's fine.

373
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,980
What?

374
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,100
Well then...

375
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,690
You do the rest.

376
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,910
Hey, wait!

377
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,360
Ichimura, you don't have to
be in such a hurry---

378
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,990
No! I'm almost done!

379
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,430
Hurry and let this be over!

380
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,470
I have to be with Oumi today!

381
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,510
It's almost the ball sports tournament.

382
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,040
What will you be playing?

383
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,110
Tennis.

384
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,390
Oh, right.

385
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,100
You're a ghost member, but you're
still a member of the tennis club.

386
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,740
Shut up.

387
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,470
This time for sure!

388
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,830
I will see Oumi in his tennis-playing form!

389
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,350
His legs in the flesh!

390
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,160
His exposed belly!

391
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,430
Oumi's brush up!

392
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,070
You just had a weird fantasy
right now, didn't you?

393
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,480
I didn't!

394
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,290
Alright, I'm heading home now.

395
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,770
What?

396
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,730
We're not going home together?

397
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,910
Careful on your way home.

398
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,070
Game set!

399
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,730
Elliechin!

400
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,210
Class B, Ichimura!

401
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,270
Alright!

402
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,880
It's nice how you can play
table tennis by yourself, right?

403
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,440
What?

404
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,840
You also seem to be bad at
interpersonal relationships.

405
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,760
Let's hope for better luck in the next life.

406
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,130
Next life?

407
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,730
Elliechin!

408
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,800
Congrats on getting to the finals!

409
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,680
Thank you!

410
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,030
I'm glad you'll make it in time.

411
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,990
What?

412
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,340
The tennis finals' about to start.

413
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:26,560
Oumi's amazing! He got to
the finals as a freshman?

414
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,760
That guy doesn't even
practice that much.

415
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
He gets only the good parts.

416
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,090
That pisses me off.

417
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,410
I wonder if Oumi will accept it?

418
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,240
Hey! I heard Oumi got injured!

419
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,100
He's sitting out from the finals.

420
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,130
What? Why?

421
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,990
He's not in the clinic.
I wonder where he is?

422
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,500
Elliechin! I brought some props for cheering!

423
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,650
Sorry! I have to go.

424
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,850
Sorry!
- What?

425
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,320
Ellie?

426
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,990
I'm sorry.

427
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,440
How's your injury?

428
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,730
You should really go to the clinic.

429
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,510
It's fine.

430
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,530
But...

431
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,650
I'm not injured.

432
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,180
What?

433
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,630
Just an excuse to get out of the match.

434
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,160
Did you... lie?

435
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,380
My absence ain't gonna pose a problem.

436
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,880
That's not true.

437
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
All the girls out there are
very worried about you!

438
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,540
They're merely getting carried away!

439
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,710
Even without me,

440
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,230
I'm sure they'll flock to another guy.

441
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,520
Bunch of nonsense.

442
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,230
Leave me alone, Ellie.

443
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,350
What a huge brat.

444
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,160
What?

445
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,440
You're such a damn brat, Oumi!

446
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,830
What's her problem?

447
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,640
Love to 2.

448
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,980
Serve change!

449
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,420
Seems like this game is about to wrap-up.

450
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,540
Straight loss, huh?

451
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,020
3 - 7. Serve change!

452
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,700
Timeout!

453
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,580
Your laces.

454
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,770
Sorry.

455
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,490
Hey, it's Oumi.
I wonder what's up?

456
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,510
Oumi...

457
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,500
Do

458
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,910
your

459
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,460
very

460
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,070
Well then, let's resume the game!

461
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,180
You were so close!

462
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,210
Getting first runner-up is more than enough.

463
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,390
Great work, Ichimura!
- You did well.

464
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,630
I was so moved!

465
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,790
You were so cool!

466
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,670
Thank you.

467
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,550
We're taking a photo with everybody.

468
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,380
Do you two wanna join us?

469
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,160
Then, we'll be waiting for
you in the schoolyard.

470
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,120
Good for you, Elliechin!

471
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,790
Oumi!

472
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,210
Ellie.

473
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,850
Congrats for bagging first runner-up.

474
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,570
I'm sorry for saying something
rude to you a while back.

475
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:18,960
Enough about that.

476
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,200
I...

477
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,260
When I heard that you wouldn't be able
to participate in the finals, I was devastated.

478
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,730
Because Oumi...

479
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,000
You always did your best.

480
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,240
Alright, I'm heading home now.

481
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,030
I got so curious when I saw how you're
using a different hand when carrying your bag.

482
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,040
I secretly trailed after you.

483
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,360
And then...

484
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,210
Oumi, you look like you can
do anything under the sun,

485
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,930
but you actually do exert
some effort too.

486
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,160
Give me a break!

487
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,170
Ellie, you're totally messing with my head.

488
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:25,310
What're you gonna do about it?

489
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,370
Go... Go ahead!

490
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,960
I'd like to take responsibility,

491
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,980
so I'm willing to accept all of you!

492
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,200
So, please be rest assured!

493
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,240
What do you think?

494
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,270
Hold on!

495
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,130
Wait! I'm sorry!

496
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,600
Huh?

497
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,440
You said you'll accept all of me!

498
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,980
That is right! But who would
have thought you'd really...

499
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,380
Well...

500
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,570
Enough. Come out of it.

501
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,940
Come out already.

502
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,200
What's that?

503
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,130
Don't you get so excited just
because it's the ball sports tournament.

504
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,800
Oumi...

505
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,710
Ellie...

506
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,120
I like you.

507
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,270
Can I... kiss you?

508
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,630
I can't?

509
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,240
It's not that you can't.

510
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:56,960
I also...

511
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,820
Oumi, I...

512
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,570
I'm in your care.

513
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,680
You're my girlfriend from now on.

514
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,780
With pleasure!

515
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,800
Ellie...

516
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,010
Spring has come for you!

517
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,890
Right after the ball sports tournament,
he tried to kiss me behind everyone's backs,

518
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,740
Gosh, I'm at an age where
I can't hold back anymore!

519
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:08,040
#restassured
#imgettingallhot

520
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,790
Just a while back,

521
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,940
Oumi, who was nothing more than
a figment of my imagination,

522
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,120
and I, are now dating.

523
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,060
Heart-squeeze!

524
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,950
Oh? Are you two going out with each other?

525
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,690
What a lovey-dovey couple!

526
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:43,330
Oh, come on! Be quiet! Lower it down!

527
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,360
Oh, come on! Gosh!

528
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,750
Very delighted!
Thank you so much!

529
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,150
Elliechin?

530
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,000
Excuse me.

531
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,140
But, it's a secret from everyone else.

532
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,850
This is my reality.

533
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,730
Excuse me!

534
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,070
Oh! It's Akira Oumi!

535
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,570
Where's Shiota?

536
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,830
In a meeting.

537
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,980
Well, here's my notes.

538
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,450
Tell him I placed it here.

539
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,850
Is Ellie coming over here
today to write her review?

540
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,880
Beats me.

541
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,020
Why not ask her yourself?

542
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,260
Well, now that's gonna look
like I was waiting for her.

543
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,840
I mean, you are waiting for her, right?

544
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,970
If you really like her that much,

545
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,720
don't make her feel so lonely.

546
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,450
What?

547
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,730
I'm saying, make sure you
take care of her very well.

548
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,130
See ya!

549
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,970
I guess, it's a bad idea for us
to go home together, right?

550
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,680
Should we put more distance between us?

551
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,520
Ellie.

552
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,240
Yes?

553
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,490
Do you have time?

554
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,710
What?

555
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,980
My parents will be home late tonight.

556
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:19,900
Come over my place?

557
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,130
I've finally...

558
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,190
...gotten inside Oumi's room!

559
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,590
He invited me to come over while
his parents are away?

560
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,920
That's what this is about, right?

561
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,110
Right here! Just us two!

562
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,760
Of course, it's just us two.

563
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,980
That means...

564
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,020
In about an hour, we'll both
join the ranks of the adults.

565
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,730
What? I don't know what to do!

566
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,270
Ellie, are you fine with banana milk?

567
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,640
Hey!

568
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,410
What's wrong?

569
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:07,880
Nothing.

570
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,490
I am always...

571
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,180
alright with it anytime.

572
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,200
What?

573
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,730
If it's with you...

574
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,890
Well...

575
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,040
Are you sure?

576
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,780
Of course!

577
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,370
Close your eyes.

578
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:36,610
No.

579
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,630
Sorry.

580
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,270
I didn't mean to corner you like that.

581
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,690
Not at all! It's fine with me.

582
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,240
"Take good care of you"?

583
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,490
It's complicated as it sounds.

584
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,270
Sorry.

585
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,940
I haven't been able to do a
good job out of everything.

586
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,840
What?

587
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,860
Wrong spot!

588
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,780
I kissed his neck!

589
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,010
I'm sorry!

590
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,430
Now we're even.

591
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,230
If you do this to me...!

592
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:32,400
Ellie's delusions will be unstoppable!

593
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,610
I was in a call with him one night.

594
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,330
He says, "I'm about to get into the bath now."

595
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:45,800
Are you trying to test my imaginations
to the limit by saying that?!

596
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,160
A. Naked

597
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,270
B. Bathrobe

598
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,280
#imhopingforA

599
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,710
#letitbeA

600
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,090
Oumi?

601
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,210
Aoba.

602
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,950
We last saw each other
during graduation, right?

603
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,560
Excuse me. He's my friend from tennis club.

604
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,120
Sorry.

605
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,710
Do you get this much attention
at your school too?

606
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,170
I guess.

607
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,990
You've been winning so many
matches at your club, huh?

608
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,290
I really envy you.

609
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,180
Hey, do you know each other?

610
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,070
Well, I'm going now.

611
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,820
Kobayashi.

612
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,100
If you need more help,

613
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,370
call out to Ichimura.

614
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,600
"Lovey-dovey again today as usual."

615
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,860
Yes! It's been going very well!

616
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,140
Alright!

617
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,030
Are you alright?

618
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,980
I'm fine.

619
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,160
You always have your shoelaces untied.

620
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,770
Thank you.

621
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,120
Ouch!

622
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,360
Let me see your foot.

623
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,720
What? Hey!

624
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,250
Stop it!

625
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,110
Sorry!

626
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,390
But, I'm probably okay.

627
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,510
I did it again.

628
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,460
What?

629
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:16,340
There must be something missing in me.

630
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,510
For the past 16 years,

631
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,880
I always feel like I'm putting together
a puzzle that doesn't come together.

632
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,560
I guess we'll have to hope
better on our next life.

633
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,680
It's not just you, Kaname!

634
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,780
I think we're all incomplete.

635
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,440
I just realized this not long ago.

636
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,670
Someone who looks so perfect,

637
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,270
they're actually not all that in reality.

638
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,600
Of course! As you can see,

639
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,730
I'm quite in pieces myself too.

640
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,500
And then I found people who
helped me become whole.

641
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,930
Which is why, this time,

642
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:15,680
I wish I could be like that
person for someone too.

643
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,160
You too! You shouldn't
be saying in your next life---

644
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,180
What kind?

645
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:24,190
What?

646
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,990
What kind of person will fill in the gaps?

647
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,090
That's...

648
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,350
Like your friends?

649
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,740
Or a boyfriend?

650
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,420
Ichimura! Can I place it here?

651
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:48,790
Sure!

652
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,690
Thank you so much.

653
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,010
Yes! It's been going very well!

654
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,520
I'm looking forward to more of
these cringe-worthy fantasies.

655
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:56,880
What?

656
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,570
You received a comment from Perolina

657
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,710
That's mine!

658
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,700
Thanks!

659
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,960
Alright, last but not least.
For the Planning Committee.

660
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,560
We'll need a class representative.
Anyone up to the task?

661
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:39,000
Well, I'm all good.

662
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,360
Wanna do it, Hasegawa?

663
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,680
What? No, no, no.

664
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:49,560
Mr. Shiota! I nominate Ichimura!

665
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,620
What?

666
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,300
She was so cool during
the ball sports tournament.

667
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,890
I think she would be the perfect
fit as our class representative.

668
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,330
I agree!

669
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,100
Me too.

670
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:02,210
Same here!

671
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,950
That sounds good!

672
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,900
Ichimura? What do you think?

673
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,800
Yes! I...

674
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,040
I'll do it.

675
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,690
I'll do my best as your executive
committee member!

676
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:37,460
Alright! Ichimura will be doing it then.

677
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,790
We're counting on you.

678
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:49,570
What?

679
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,770
Committee member for
the Cultural Festival?

680
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,320
Yes.

681
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,440
You could have just turned that down.

682
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,570
What?

683
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,850
I mean, we'll have less time together now.

684
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:17,350
But, everyone wanted me to do it.

685
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,160
It's the first time this happened to me.

686
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,920
Well then,

687
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,560
once the Cultural Festival
is over, make some time for me.

688
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,420
What?

689
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,520
As I said...

690
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,270
Let's continue from where
we stopped last time.

691
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:01,540
Last time?

692
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:04,980
Continue?

693
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:08,340
I know we're in the middle of the
movie, but we've got breaking news.

694
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:12,190
It has been revealed that Eriko Ichimura,
who is well-known for her role as Lovesick Ellie,

695
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,740
has finally realized that she will now
reach reality beyond her delusions.

696
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,970
We are currently investigating the detailed
schedule and will provide further updates

697
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,720
as soon as more information becomes available.

698
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,740
Well then, on to our next news.

699
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:27,300
A panda has given birth!

700
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,260
Finally, Ellie will also...

701
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,160
join the rank of adults...

702
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,740
I did it with my boyfriend yesterday.

703
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:44,420
Seriously? How was it?

704
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,310
So...

705
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,450
...which he showed to me...

706
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,060
...and it was just crazy.

707
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,490
I mean, that happens on your first.

708
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,230
I guess mine was banana?

709
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,020
Seriously?! Banana?

710
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,480
Banana!

711
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,820
I can't!

712
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:15,750
Sorry!

713
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,520
Kaname?

714
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:23,630
Is something wrong?

715
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:29,440
I saw you about to buy something...

716
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,060
Hey, Kaname?

717
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,550
You know?

718
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,160
Up until now, I had lived my life
with expectations for the next life.

719
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:54,120
I thought there are other people who're
going through the same desperate pain,

720
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,370
but when I actually met them, they were
surprisingly genuine and struggling.

721
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:05,370
Me too...

722
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,430
Can I expect more from
this current life?

723
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,990
Ichimura.

724
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,750
You're Lovesick Ellie, aren't you?

725
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,420
W-W-W-W-WHY?!

726
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,580
This is me.

727
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,150
Perolina

728
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:04,270
Kaname is...

729
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:06,100
Perolina?!

730
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,890
That means...

731
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:17,650
Hey!

732
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,430
Too bad for you.

733
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,250
If you don't want me to
expose this to the public,

734
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,830
you know what to do, right?

735
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:32,200
If you don't buy all of these
items here for me,

736
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,120
I'm gonna kill you!

737
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:38,130
A slave contract from hell!

738
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:46,370
No!

739
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,770
Ichimura?

740
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:56,740
Yes! Master!

741
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,500
I've got a little favor.

742
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,070
Is this it?

743
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,680
Will you

744
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,540
be friends with me?

745
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,000
What?

746
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:25,570
I...

747
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:29,170
I wanna be friends with Lovesick Ellie.

748
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:43,100
Ellie...

749
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,410
Oumi?

750
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,860
Give it a thought, Ellie.

751
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,320
There's nothing to worry about?

752
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,840
Lock your account, block him,

753
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,290
turn down his friendship
request, and that settles it!

754
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,650
But...

755
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:34,620
What? Do you have other options?

756
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,230
He asked me if we could be friends.

757
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:42,080
If it were me, I'm sure it
would have taken so much bravery.

758
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,020
So you'll give in because you pity him?

759
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,660
That's not it but...

760
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:55,630
You know?

761
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,420
I've decided to participate in
the prefectural tennis tournament.

762
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:01,620
Really?

763
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,460
They didn't have enough players
so they asked me to join it.

764
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,050
I'm thinking about really
giving it my all this time.

765
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,850
I'll definitely come to cheer you on!

766
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,710
I want to see you while you're in
tennis-playing mode!

767
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,770
Then, I'll win the game for you.

768
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,420
Sure!

769
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,610
I'll handle that issue with Kaname.

770
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:43,740
What?

771
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,060
If he really want friends that much,

772
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,970
then I'll be his friend.

773
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,590
Alright!

774
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:57,040
I'm off to my tennis training.

775
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,420
Sure.

776
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,540
See you.

777
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:03,170
Have a good one!

778
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,400
Where are you supposed to meet?

779
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,290
In front of the aquariums.

780
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,190
Oumi...

781
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,820
He looks exquisite in casual clothes too!

782
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,830
What's wrong?

783
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,000
What?

784
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:20,600
It's nothing.

785
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:34,410
Kaname!

786
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,790
This is Oumi.

787
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,660
Hi! Nice to meet you.

788
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,070
I only made plans to hang
out with Ichimura though.

789
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,340
Why are you here?

790
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,710
Huh?

791
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,270
Well...

792
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:02,300
Oumi was saying how he
wants to be friends with you!

793
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,900
I don't wanna.

794
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,420
Huh?

795
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:11,680
Oumi, what relationship do
you have with Ichimura?

796
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:13,370
What?

797
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,940
Why are you getting in the way
of my time with Ichimura?

798
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,020
I'm...

799
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,660
Ellie's boyfri...

800
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,840
He's my friend!

801
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,140
Right?

802
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,530
A friend, huh?

803
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,820
This is getting boring so I'm leaving.

804
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,500
Wait! Kaname!

805
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:41,980
I'm sorry.

806
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,860
You had to come all the way here.

807
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,840
You don't need to apologize.

808
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:53,630
That's true but...

809
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,150
About Kaname...

810
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,600
I hope you don't get mad at him too much.

811
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,970
Although Kaname is quite straightforward,

812
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,690
I don't think he means any harm.

813
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,790
Give him a bit more time and
I'm sure he'll warm up to you---

814
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:11,780
Why...

815
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,710
Why do I need to wait until he gets used to me?

816
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,380
What?

817
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,970
Why do you care about him?

818
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:28,480
It's not like I...

819
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,690
A while ago too...

820
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,460
When I was trying to say
I'm your boyfriend,

821
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,690
you stopped me, right?

822
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:35,940
That's...

823
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,180
It'd be bad if that got spread
to everyone at school.

824
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:42,280
Are you sure that's all?

825
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,330
Why do you want

826
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:51,200
to be friends with him so bad?

827
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:59,330
Making friends is as easy as pie.

828
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,690
Easy?

829
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:10,400
Is it?

830
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,490
It didn't come easy with me.

831
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,430
It was only purely by luck

832
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,670
that I met you and Sara.

833
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,290
If it wasn't so, I'm sure
right now I'd still be...

834
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:46,130
I'm sure you'll never understand
my feelings about it.

835
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,460
Well, of course I wouldn't!

836
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,760
But what about you, Ellie?

837
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,370
You don't understand how I feel!

838
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,520
What?

839
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:06,930
You...

840
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,640
Don't you and Kaname understand each
other better than you and I do?

841
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,170
What do you mean?

842
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:27,380
Why don't you date Kaname instead of me then?

843
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:33,890
If we can't even understand each other,

844
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,500
there's no meaning to our relationship then.

845
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,580
Are you saying...

846
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,330
that we should break up?

847
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:02,700
Maybe so.

848
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,330
Alright.

849
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,040
Why did this turn out this way?

850
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:01,450
Even when I

851
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,810
love Oumi so much.

852
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,200
Since then, I...

853
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,300
I could no longer go back to
my world of fantasies.

854
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:41,360
Well then, it's now decided that we'll
place the banner on the window of 3B's classroom.

855
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,810
Alright! Let's take a short break!

856
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:46,220
We prepared a lot of refreshments for you.

857
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,510
Let's eat it with everyone.

858
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:54,580
Ichimura, don't you want some?

859
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:57,840
I'm...

860
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,340
Alright.

861
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,590
This is a problem.

862
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,490
Of all days, it had to be postponed
on the day of the cultural festival!

863
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,790
I don't know what happened but

864
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,530
make sure you attend the prefectural
tournament and don't back out from it.

865
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:31,710
What?

866
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:34,110
On the finals of the ball sports tournament,

867
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,400
I heard you stepped off from
playing due to a strange sickness.

868
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,160
You can't underestimate a teacher's eyes.

869
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:42,860
Shut up.

870
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:51,090
Now that you've changed,
you gotta atleast do your best.

871
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,830
Changed?

872
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:58,450
If you were the person you were before,
you wouldn't join even if you were invited.

873
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,650
But this time, you decided to attend.

874
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,870
Make sure you hold onto that feeling.

875
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,880
Food poisoning?!

876
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,270
Including the chairperson,

877
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:49,470
we got 5 absences and 7 people sick.

878
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:53,290
We think it's probably
because of the refreshments.

879
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:58,630
Oh, yeah. You didn't eat any
of those, right? Ichimura?

880
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:01,760
Yes.

881
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,640
Sorry to ask this but

882
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,630
could you please take over
as the acting chairperson?

883
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,320
What?!

884
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,180
Goodluck on the prefectural tournament!

885
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,730
It's Akira Oumi!

886
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,640
Are you on your way to
the tournament now?

887
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,120
Have you heard?

888
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,580
Elliechin has become the
Acting Committee Chairman.

889
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,020
What?

890
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:27,410
Everyone came down with food poisoning.

891
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,420
Was it pushed on to her again?

892
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:37,190
Seems like she has it hard.
Why don't you cheer her up?

893
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:40,520
Why me?

894
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,690
Hey!

895
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:45,950
A man's gotta be there for the girl he
likes when she's feeling anxious, you know?

896
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:49,680
Well...

897
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,630
I'm not her boyfriend anymore.

898
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,140
Oh, really?

899
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,670
Fine by me.

900
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:03,490
Looks like Elliechin is having
a rough time doing everything by herself.

901
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,030
I'm sure they pushed the
task on to you again?

902
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:51,920
Good for you for taking on
such a troublesome role.

903
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,400
You see...

904
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,220
I was really happy when I was
recommended to join the committee.

905
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,750
Some of them saw me during
the ball sports tournament,

906
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,960
and they think I'm someone
they can really rely on.

907
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,950
This has never happened to me before.

908
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,570
That's why...

909
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:31,380
If everyone needs help,

910
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,400
I want to be of help even
just a little bit.

911
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,190
Oumi changed my world.

912
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,060
So I'd want to work a bit harder.

913
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,820
I'm sorry.

914
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:59,130
Why am I talking about this?

915
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:05,880
I...

916
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,410
I was just teasing you.

917
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,230
It's funny seeing someone who has
these cringe-worthy fantasies,

918
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,860
flail around a lot in real life.

919
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,810
But...

920
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:33,590
I've gotten bored of it.

921
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,770
Make up with Oumi, okay?

922
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,280
Kaname!

923
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,790
Those days when social media
was the only place where I belonged,

924
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:12,100
I received a message from stranger,

925
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,310
and that made me so happy.

926
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,810
That's why...

927
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:33,970
Thank you.

928
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:37,740
Mr. Perolina.

929
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:49,750
I'm glad

930
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,550
that you're here in real life.

931
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,990
I'm so glad that Lovesick Ellie was here for me.

932
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:55,950
Ready!

933
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,000
Hello! Here's our event map.

934
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,640
Hello! Here's our event map.

935
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,270
Alright!

936
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:34,440
Game set! End match! Oumi!

937
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:45,960
Are you alright?

938
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:47,900
I'm fine!

939
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,060
Is she really the Acting Committee Chairman?

940
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,170
Can she handle it?

941
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,780
You've got time. Help her out.

942
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:56,890
No way!

943
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,100
Competing for the finals are
Nishi Highschool winner; Kou Aoba,

944
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,340
against Fujimomo winner; Akira Oumi.

945
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,290
As expected from you, Oumi.

946
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:17,820
But, give this game to me.

947
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,110
You can do anything so that's
not much to you, right?

948
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:24,690
I can't afford to lose.

949
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,960
I said I'll definitely win this game.

950
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,520
I made a promise.

951
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,490
I told you, even if you go around...

952
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,660
I'm sorry!

953
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,060
Ichimura!
- Yes?

954
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,880
Have you done the sound check
for the event venue yet?

955
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:48,470
Sorry! I'll check it right now!

956
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:51,790
Ichimura!

957
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:52,430
Yes?

958
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,360
The blackout curtains for the
haunted house got ripped.

959
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,240
What?!

960
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,580
Hey, Ichimura.

961
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,620
We don't need vinyl tapes though.

962
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,550
Vinyl tapes?

963
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,290
Ichimura!

964
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:03,570
Yes!

965
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:04,430
Excuse me.

966
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:06,130
We don't have enough folding chairs here!

967
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:08,650
I'll do it right now.

968
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,790
Elliechin, are you alright?

969
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:12,440
I brought it!

970
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:13,540
Now, listen here.

971
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,110
You are so useless!

972
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,510
You're quite bad at planning.

973
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:17,850
What are we supposed to do?
The festival is about to start!

974
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:29,730
I'm sorry! I'll do it right away!

975
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,050
Sorry. Can I leave the rest to you?

976
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,040
Hey, you guys! Listen to me!

977
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,080
You are so annoying, you shitheads!

978
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,050
We don't have enough manpower,
so it can't be helped, can it?!

979
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,100
If you've got time to complain,

980
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:54,960
then move your hands!

981
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:57,390
Go on.

982
01:29:58,810 --> 01:29:59,990
Alright.

983
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,050
Leo.

984
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,060
If your friend is important to you,

985
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:18,930
then they're important to me too.

986
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:27,840
What's that about?

987
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:28,950
What?

988
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,100
Hey, wait! Didn't I sound cool back there?

989
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:32,990
You’re seriously impossible.

990
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,150
Seriously impossible?
Can you tell me why?

991
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,120
You're a drag!

992
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:07,720
Executive Committee Chairman (Acting)

993
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,740
Why am I so incapable?

994
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:22,680
Just when I finally got
recommended for the task...

995
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:29,580
Just when everyone is
finally relying on me?

996
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:36,360
Oumi...

997
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,750
Oumi!

998
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:24,570
Are you alright?

999
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,040
You too!

1000
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,310
What about your game?

1001
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:41,860
I promised you I'll win the match, right?

1002
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,750
I was able to win because
you were there for me.

1003
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,640
What?

1004
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,850
I was about to run away from it again,

1005
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,220
but...

1006
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,930
I decided I want to give it my all this time.

1007
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:17,580
Thank you, Ellie.

1008
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:30,350
I...

1009
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,840
I...

1010
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,280
I haven't done my best yet.

1011
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:53,270
I'm going back.

1012
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:58,850
I really want to give it my all.

1013
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,320
Oumi...

1014
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,460
Thank you so much!

1015
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,260
Hey, not yet?

1016
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,310
She'll be here soon.

1017
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,560
We won't make it in time.

1018
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:22,450
Please wait a bit more.

1019
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:24,130
It's about to start!
- She'll be here!

1020
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:27,460
Move! Please move away!

1021
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:28,630
Elliechin?

1022
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:30,590
Move out of the way!

1023
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:32,270
Passing through!

1024
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,930
I've brought you your blackout curtains!

1025
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:35,710
Next, I'll go check the sound system!

1026
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,370
Have a good run!

1027
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:50,880
Sorry. Can we increase the
volume of the mic a bit more?

1028
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:52,210
Alright.
- Please do.

1029
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,580
Move it a bit to the right!

1030
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:55,790
Right there!

1031
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:58,040
What do you think?

1032
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,400
Looking okay!

1033
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,120
Ichimura!

1034
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:04,860
Let me help you.

1035
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,260
Alright, can you do first row please?

1036
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,120
Got it.

1037
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:13,980
Excuse me, can you please leave
the passage way open?

1038
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:15,920
Sure!
- Thanks.

1039
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:38,860
Thank you so much.

1040
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,860
Thank you so much.

1041
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,000
That's a wrap!

1042
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,250
Thank you, Sara.

1043
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,780
Let's do our best and clean up, shall we?

1044
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,670
Let's!

1045
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:53,720
It's gotten quite dark now.

1046
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:54,540
Right?

1047
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,590
We gotta finish up.

1048
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:02,350
Great work, Ichimura!

1049
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:04,420
You guys, Ichimura's here!

1050
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:17,530
Everyone...

1051
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:20,790
You saved the day, Ichimura.

1052
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:22,400
Thank you!

1053
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:24,570
Thanks, Ichimura!

1054
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:26,520
We're truly grateful to you.

1055
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,300
Not at all.

1056
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:32,800
I did nothing.

1057
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:40,030
We're so glad to have you as
the Acting Committee Chairman.

1058
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:58,980
A round of applause for Ichimura!

1059
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:04,470
Thank you!

1060
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,760
Thank you so much!

1061
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:26,350
Well, we've got one final event to wrap up!

1062
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,290
Alright, let's get to the grounds then.

1063
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,210
Alright, let's go!

1064
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,100
Let's go! Fighting!

1065
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:35,880
Hey!

1066
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:38,700
Come with us, Ichimura!
- Coming!

1067
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:40,250
Elliechin!

1068
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,270
There's a stepladder that we
left behind on the rooftop.

1069
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:44,920
Can you get it for me?

1070
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,230
Stepladder?

1071
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,370
Please!

1072
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,300
We ask of you!

1073
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:51,340
Sure.

1074
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:20,100
Oumi!

1075
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,360
I'm glad the cultural festival
wrapped up nicely.

1076
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:35,570
Right.

1077
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:42,670
You see...

1078
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:50,200
I didn't think about your feelings at all.

1079
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,620
Even when you got recommended as the
acting chairman of the cultural festival,

1080
01:38:57,610 --> 01:38:59,420
I still kept thinking of myself.

1081
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:02,890
I couldn't even be happy for you.

1082
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:08,600
Not at all.

1083
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:16,840
That matter with Kaname...

1084
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:19,410
I'm sorry for being crude about it.

1085
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,420
Even when I'm in the same predicament.

1086
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,060
Same?

1087
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:35,910
You see,

1088
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,340
all this time,

1089
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,340
I was so convinced

1090
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:42,980
that nobody would understand me,
and it warped my mind.

1091
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:48,550
But,

1092
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,630
I met you,

1093
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,690
and I wanted you to know more about me,

1094
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:56,270
I wanted you to really see through me.

1095
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,400
Ellie, you...

1096
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,500
You changed my world.

1097
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:18,150
Me?

1098
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,970
I changed your world?

1099
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:35,980
I don't want to be
separated from you too, Ellie.

1100
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,370
That's why...

1101
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:49,280
One more time...

1102
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,390
I want you to be my girlfriend again.

1103
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:10,240
With pleasure!

1104
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:22,020
I'll be your girlfriend,

1105
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:26,660
and I'll get as close as I can to you,
get my hands all over you!

1106
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:32,400
You pervert.

1107
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,350
So pretty...

1108
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,280
Ellie...

1109
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:26,420
Thank you for falling in love with me.

1110
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,040
Ellie...

1111
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:30,790
Is it okay if I just want you?

1112
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:37,900
What?

1113
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,700
Does that...

1114
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:45,070
Do you mean that?!

1115
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,110
What? What?

1116
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:56,160
What should I do?

1117
01:43:56,190 --> 01:43:57,310
Oumi!

1118
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:58,880
Oumi, you...!

1119
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,700
The school cultural festival wrapped up quite well.

1120
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:06,170
And as it did,

1121
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,650
he invited me to his place as a reward...

1122
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:12,180
I have finally climbed the ladder to adulthood!

1123
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:15,430
When will the next time be?

1124
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:21,420
#givemeanotherservingplease

1125
01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:38,250
This is... kinda embarrassing.

1126
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:41,130
You know?

1127
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,510
I've decided not to worry about
what other people think of us.

1128
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:49,090
As long as you know me best,
then that's more than enough for me.

1129
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,820
Hey, Oumi. What's the meaning of this?

1130
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,000
I can't stand looking at them!

1131
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:54,810
What's this about?

1132
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,740
What's with that woman? Does she
really think they look good together?

1133
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,960
I will protect you, Ellie.

1134
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,090
Fantasy turned to reality.

1135
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:27,640
My wish has now come true.

1136
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,410
That's nice! They actually look good together!

1137
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:31,350
Really?

1138
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:32,680
This is crazy!

1139
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:36,310
They look so happy!

1140
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:37,910
What a perfect pair, right?

1141
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:45,470
It's so nice to be in love.

1142
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,090
Maybe I should try making
clothes for you next time.

1143
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,570
What?

1144
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:56,190
What does that mean?

1145
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:04,380
Hey, come on! Wait! Sara!

1146
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:07,330
Off to explore the unknown with
my greedy boyfriend! #banana

1147
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:06,790
Banana?

1148
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:11,230
I won't ask for anything more than this.

1149
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,290
Hey, Kaname.

1150
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,490
Let's eat lunch together.

1151
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:15,970
I'll be there shortly.

1152
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,860
I think it's time I stop fantasizing...

1153
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:28,440
He said, 'I'm going to kiss all the moles on your body.'
Today is the day I'm most grateful for melanin.
#Iprobablycanbekissedabout49times

1154
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:28,440
Recently, someone told me,
'You've become more beautiful.'
I told my boyfriend about it and he said,
'It's all thanks to me.'
#thatreplywaserotic

1155
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:28,440
I'll be wearing sexy lingerie
every day from now on.
#Beingpreparedmeansnoworries

1156
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:28,440
'I actually have a surprise for you on your birthday.'
Close your eyes,' he says. It's definitely a kiss!
#goshimnotgoodwithsurprises

1157
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,930
No, no, I can't! There's no way!

1158
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,980
There are still a million
fantasies I need to come true!

1159
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:37,920
Hey, I bet you're fantasizing again, aren't you?

1160
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:42,040
I guess I can't quit being 'Ellie' yet.

1161
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:51,810
Let's keep the fantasies rolling!
