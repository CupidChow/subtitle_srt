00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:50,950
P.S.,

178
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,360
a man who works hard

179
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,240
is the most attractive.

180
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,270
Third,

181
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,000
be tender and considerate

182
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,390
in a way beyond colleagues.

183
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,070
Think more of the other one.

184
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,200
That's all?

185
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,630
That's all.

186
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,890
I forgot to write

187
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,770
the most important point.

188
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,580
You have to understand her.

189
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,740
Even if

190
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,770
you don't know how to make her happy,

191
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,070
at least you should know

192
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,880
how to prevent her from being unhappy.

193
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,460
We have already

194
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,450
learned from the past.

195
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,670
We should deal with the relationship

196
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,050
more carefully in the future.

197
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,600
Clear?

198
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,150
Clear.

199
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,030
But I really think

200
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,870
I have accomplished

201
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,390
all of those in your notes.

202
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,280
I don't think so.

203
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,560
Right,

204
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,450
about Yang Lanhang.

205
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,370
Today,

206
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:54,920
I've heard some gossips

207
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,130
about him.

208
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,390
What gossips?

209
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,380
It's said that

210
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,550
Yang Lanhang was particularly unwell

211
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,810
that day.

212
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,610
Then,

213
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,870
he went to the lounge room.

214
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,420
Lu Qing took leave of absence just for him

215
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,020
to give him a glass of water.

216
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,910
After no more than ten minutes,

217
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,170
Yang Lanhang

218
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,600
stormed out of the lab.

219
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,730
It's said that

220
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,710
one of his collar shirt buttons

221
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,380
went missing.

222
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,390
Moreover,

223
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,060
there was a lipstick mark on the collar.

224
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,430
Yang.

225
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,350
Don't be so dramatic.

226
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,090
There was no lipstick mark

227
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,810
at all.

228
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,490
The shirt was a bit wrinkled, that's all.

229
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,750
How do you know?

230
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,840
I saw it.

231
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,430
Really?

232
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,330
Then it is not a rumour.

233
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,520
This Yang lanhang is a piece of work.

234
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,580
I've heard that

235
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,140
when he was studying abroad,

236
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,230
those pretty girls

237
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,570
all put love letters

238
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,370
at his door.

239
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,670
He didn't accept any of them.

240
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,060
And it's said that

241
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,530
few girls are in his lab.

242
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,620
This kind of person

243
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,840
who is aloof and handsome

244
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,560
is rare these days.

245
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,300
I know why

246
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,940
you think you two are getting along.

247
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,950
It turns out that he thinks

248
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,260
you have no other feelings for him.

249
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,190
What are you talking about?

250
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,450
What getting along?

251
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,330
Besides, he and I

252
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,460
are not collaborating at all.

253
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,640
He just oppresses me and

254
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,650
exploits me.

255
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,620
If you really think

256
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,130
he oppresses and exploits you.

257
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,730
You can tell him you like him.

258
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,320
Scare him.

259
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,120
Why should I do that?

260
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,810
To scare him.

261
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,990
Confess my love to him?

262
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,960
He deserves my love?

263
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,530
Morning, Yang.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,300
Morning.

265
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:07,930
Morning.

266
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,480
Why do you come to work

267
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,530
so early today?

268
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,380
Ouyang has experiments later on.

269
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,960
We haven't really talked that much.

270
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,600
Are you from Huaihai University?

271
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
I'm from Department of Physics in Huaihai University.

272
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,950
This is my second year of study.

273
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,310
Then you are my senior.

274
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,520
Jing,

275
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,740
they say that

276
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,380
you are Ouyang's assistant.

277
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,350
And you say stuff like

278
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,520
Ouyang doing experiments.

279
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,570
But

280
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,000
how come I've never seen him before?

281
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,430
It might be

282
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,780
a good thing.

283
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,490
He is that Ouyang?

284
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,590
Yes.

285
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,070
But he is not so approachable

286
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,120
as me.

287
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,930
You better stay away from him.

288
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,270
Beware of getting hurt.

289
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,210
No worries.

290
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,930
I won't be staying here for too long anyway.

291
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,190
I had no intention of

292
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,620
getting close to anyone.

293
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,190
Are you leaving?

294
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,340
Don't leave. I'll get you covered.

295
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,700
Have some respect.

296
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,960
I'm your senior.

297
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,430
You'll get me covered?

298
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,620
Guru was the classmate

299
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,140
with Zhang.

300
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
But because Zhang came back to teach.

301
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,300
His position is somehow

302
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,640
higher than guru.

303
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,160
Guru doesn't care.

304
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,370
But I'm not satisfied.

305
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,800
We have to work together

306
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,650
to make guru the veritable leader

307
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,990
in this lab.

308
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,710
You are too young to

309
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,650
start a group like this.

310
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,650
No.

311
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,290
I just think

312
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,590
in this lab

313
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,390
no one can lead me

314
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
except guru.

315
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,970
Let's bounce.

316
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,220
Lingling.

317
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,070
Come here.

318
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,750
You say that

319
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,010
when Lingling and I are getting along,

320
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,060
I have to make sure not to say things that

321
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,360
make her angry, right?

322
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,410
But we usually spend time together

323
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,880
in the lab.

324
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,970
When in the lab,

325
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,020
I must only concentrate on the experiment.

326
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,360
I couldn't care less about her.

327
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,790
So I made this.

328
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,080
The band in the lab

329
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,960
looks pretty smart.

330
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,180
But it is actually more similar to

331
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,440
the band in a gym.

332
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,530
It can indicate time

333
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,870
and monitor heart rate.

334
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,840
Most importantly,

335
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,550
I planted

336
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,730
a linkage application inside.

337
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,120
When her heartbeat exceeds 100 BPM

338
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,040
or when her mood swings

339
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,630
are relatively strong,

340
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,310
my band will vibrate in sync.

341
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,359
In this way,

342
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,319
when I accidentally piss her off,

343
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,510
I can make it up in time.

344
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
When she is pissed off by others,

345
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,490
I can be her savior.

346
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,700
Is it practical?

347
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,859
Top students are so crazy

348
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,000
when in love.

349
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,930
Where do you get this from?

350
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,040
This is not kind of things that

351
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,839

You're back.

528
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,130
I've made up my mind.

529
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,790
I'm going to tell Yang Lanhang my feelings.

530
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,690
Her feelings?

531
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,540
What happened?

532
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,550
After only several days,

533
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,890
she has changed her attitude

534
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,570
and is going to tell her feelings to me?

535
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,810
Is there any misunderstanding?

[Forever is for Ever]

537
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,340
I don't mean that kind of feelings.

538
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:26,570
Go ahead.

539
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,970
Go back to Yang Lanhang.

540
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,730
He's really a bad egg.

541
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,990
He bullied me so much.

542
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,830
You see.

543
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,670
It's rare for me

544
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,830
to have a date.

545
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,600
Is it easy for me?

546
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,030
I want to spare some time

547
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,910
and you know,

548
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,920
cultivate feelings.

549
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:39,720
But he actually....

550
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,480
Does he understand

551
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,860
we cross-country lovers

552
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,910
who are fighting against

554
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,600
all the time

555
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,060
can hardly spare time to date?

556
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,530
Yes.

557
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,790
He's gone too far.

558
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,550
He was wrong.

559
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,640
He was wrong.

560
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,270
Yes.

561
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,280
He was wrong.

562
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,290
Is there any misunderstanding?

563
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,690
No.

564
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,820
I only wish that

565
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,330
he could henceforward stay away from me.

566
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,510
The further, the better.

567
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,090
Although he asked you

568
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,310
to work overtime,

569
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,820
it didn't delay

570
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,830
our chat.

571
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,260
I just went back home, too.

572
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,290
Today's overtime is not alone.

573
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,090
Don't worry.

574
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,350
I will keep the balance.

575
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,900
I will try to disgust him

576
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,160
while keeping myself from being dismissed.

577
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,130
Otherwise, I might

578
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,100
abuse your kindness.

579
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,710
What do you plan to do?

580
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,230
Although I have no experience

581
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,410
about telling feelings to a stranger,

582
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,160
the Internet

583
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,340
helps a lot anyway.

584
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,430
I casually searched it

585
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,400
and easily found

586
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,660
the so-called best honeyed words.

587
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,750
And I have selected

588
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,180
the most disgusting ones.

589
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,140
I'm sure

590
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,910
he will feel sick and avoid me

591
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,830
as far as possible.

592
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,350
Stop your chatting.

593
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,000
Try on the clothes. Try it.

594
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,710
Get up. Get up.

595
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,170
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

596
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,590
I'll be ready soon.

597
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,560
Look at yourself.

598
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,400
One more. One more.

599
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,040
You.

600
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:08,970
My friend is asking me to

601
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,680
make preparations.

602
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,730
Let's chat later.

603
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,320
Bye.

604
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,190
Preparations?

605
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,340
Prepare for what?

606
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,950
Others are coming soon.

607
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,260
Why doesn't she tell her feelings yet?

608
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,140
I can't submit to vicious power.

609
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,530
I should fight against it

610
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,500
as long as I stay here.

611
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,270
Yang.

612
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,180
What...what's wrong?

613
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,070
I

614
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,430
have...have a word for you.

615
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,760
Although

616
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,520
I can see you

617
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,790
everyday,

618
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,150
I am still missing you

619
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,120
everyday.

620
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,850
Sometimes,

621
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,950
I saw you performing an experiment there.

622
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,300
I was deeply attracted

623
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,110
by your hands.

624
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,070
I wonder

625
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:13,680
why would there be

626
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,940

but holding them tightly.

630
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,350

I know you hate me.

And I know you hate to see me.

635
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,490
But I still want to say

636
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,730
I like you.

644

taking your clothes off first?

645
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:05,880
No.

646
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,720
No. Sorry.

647
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,900
No. I...I mean,

648
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,030
why not put your clothes on

649

650

put on a coat?

wear it today

Guess what he said to me.

704
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,000
He said

705
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,130
since you loved me so much,

706
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,600
I accepted you

707
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,160
and you should work overtime at weekend with me.

708

00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,310
He was just tricking me.

was not sincere,

I took the chance and accepted her.

to do with shamelessness?

735
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,470
She wants to make it a joke.

is the net friend

He is not a kind guy.

played games and drank with him.

757
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,000
He only knows how to kill time in bars.

758
