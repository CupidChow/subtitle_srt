00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,500
Do you have any other photos

Have you found anything?

43
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,420
It hardly comes out

44
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,220
during the day.

45
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,460
It doesn't eat, either.

One is the monkey,

73
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,820
and the other is him.

74
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,580
What?

75
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,700
Do you want to

76
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,130
beat him into submission?

77
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,340
No.

78
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,300
I am asking him to voluntarily turn himself in.

79
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,580
OK.

80
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,060
Try using your hand to

81
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,740
press the Baihui point.

82
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,380

Baihui point

85
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,780
lies in the center line of your head.

86
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,620
It lies at the intersection of the lines between the two ears.

87

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,420
Idiot.

91
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,620
You are so boring.

92
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,980
Then you are not sleepy then.

93
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,180
I am not sleepy now...

94
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,020

What do you want?

96
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,110
Shh.

97
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,580
I want to see it, too.

98
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,500
Get out of the car.

99
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,580

100
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,100

101
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,220
Well,

102
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,890

103
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,020
How annoying?

104
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,460
You

105
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,380
are so weird.

106
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,140
I just posted it

107
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,220
on Weibo.

108
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,620
Do you have to ignore me for two days?

109
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,810
Do you want a breakup?

110
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,100
What are you posting?

111
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,460
That's a lie and slandering.

112
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,420
That's a criminal crime.

113
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,650
If you get caught,

114
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,660
you will go to jail.

115
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,620
Who are you lying to?

116
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,340

117
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,100
Go to jail?

118
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,020
Let's break up.

119
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,580
Then you don't have to send meals to the jail.

120
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,780
It's just a monkey.

121
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,620
Hello.

122
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,620
How about stepping outside?

123
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,980
We have business here.

124
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,940
Help me judge.

125
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,450
I just posted a weibo.

126
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,100
I said a monkey died.

127
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,420
This person.

128
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,460
I have been with him for 5 years.

129
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,580
Now he wants to breakup.

130
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,580
I'm so upset.

131
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,300
He thinks that the monkey is more important than me.

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,170
Honey,

133
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,370
what monkey?

134
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,820
I'm telling you.

135
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,100
You don't know

136
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,020
how natural my acting skills are

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,770
I  really could be an actress.

138
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,860
My tears

139
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,140
just keep falling.

140
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,420
Tang Shun was

141
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,420
so fooled by us.

142
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,700
He really thought

143
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,500
we were a couple who wanted a breakup.

144
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,340
Hang.

145
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,820
I am putting too much effort on you.

146
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,060
Breakup is so unlucky.

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,260
I did it for your sake.

148
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,060
I am really putting too much effort on you.

149
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,180
Really touched.

150
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,610
Here.

151
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,500
It's the soup

152
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,740
my dad brought.

153
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,300
Each of you

154
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,740
have a bowl of this.

155
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,790
-Drink it while it's hot. 
-Thanks.

156
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,419
So you fooled him.

157
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,100
So?

158
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,780
So,

159
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,220
we told him

160
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,940
how serious

161
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,980
the defamation charge is.

162
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,059
And told him

163
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,380
this charge

164
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,580
was pressed by the victim.

165
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,100
If the victim gives up,

166
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,250
then it's fine.

167
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,500
So we think

168
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,700
he will beg for forgiveness.

169
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,090
Beg for our leniency.

170
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
I bet he is

171
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,980
spineless

172
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,220
since he broke the law

173
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,900
for some benefit.

174
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,380
You have a point.

175
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,820
Wait.

176
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,940
OK.

177
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,540
Just drink.

178
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,220
You.

179
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,420
Why are you putting this thing?

180
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,300
Hello.

181
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,620
Finally you pick up the phone.

182
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,620
It's not the first time you've broken up.

183
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,620
You are a grown-up now.

184
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,460
Why disappear again?

185
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,210
Don't be so dramatic.

186
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,620
I turn off the phone when I'm working.

187
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,020
Don't message

188
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,340
or call me all the time.

189
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,540
I have to work.

190
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,450
Do you know about

191
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,380
Bai Lingling?

192
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,260
Yesterday, Yang Lanhang

193
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,100
called me

194
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,200
using Lingling's phone.

195
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,220
He thought he had gotten me involved.

196
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,300
He felt sorry.

197
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,100
What's your plan?

198
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,820
I've thought it through,

199
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,460
I have worked

200
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,180
to the fullest

201
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,340
every time

202
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,700
I need to.

203
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,060
I don't regret it at all.

204
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,620
Since Lingling

205
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,820
has made up her mind.

206
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,300
I'm done with them.

207
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,060
OK.

208
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,020
I am relieved that you think so.

209
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,300
Well,

210
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,180
just go cold turkey

211
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
with those idiots' attack

212
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,300
of our Gate of Heart.

213
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,540
What do you mean?

214
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:29,850
Well,

215
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,380
the affair of Yang Lanhang and Bai Lingling

216
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,740
is like snowballing.

217
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,410
Someone checked

218
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,300
you have chased after Bai Lingling.

219
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,460
Then today they found

220
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,700
our Gate of Heart.

221
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,930
Now the criticism spills everywhere in the comment area.

222
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,660
They are aiming at me now.

223
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,740
Why go cold turkey?

224
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,020
Just bring him down.

225
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,380
Why are you so mysterious?

226
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,020
You had cameras

227
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,100
on Monkey Mountain.

228
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,900
And it's night-visioned.

229
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,980
Even at night,

230
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,330
we can see things clearly.

231
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,620
When did you

232
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,820
do that?

233
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,380
I know nothing about it.

234
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,940
Today morning.

235
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,140
When the first wave of tourists

236
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,020
were entering,

237
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,940
I got in.

238
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,820
I observed.

239
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,540
It's a feeding area.

240
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,740
At night,

241
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,300
if animals are out for food,

242
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,250
that's the place.

243
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,860
Yes. I know that place.

244
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,620
It's here.

245
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,060
We are so worried that

246
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,220
we might not get into the zoo at night.

247
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:35,660
Minghao.

248
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,940
You helped us a lot.

249
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,340
Our top minds

250
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,300
are incredible.

251
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,540
Just like cheating in the game.

252
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
We are going to solve this case soon.

253
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,400
Baby.

254
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,660
It is important for people to have self-awareness.

255
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,340
See,

256
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,100
the top mind is sitting over there.

257
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,180
We are just

258
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,550

259
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,780
Am I not a top mind?

260
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,220
You are.

261
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,460
Something's wrong.

262
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,380
Nobody cares that

263
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,660
you installed the camera?

264
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,660
Not sure.

265
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,900
That's OK if you get caught.

266
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,700
Anyway, as long as it does not involve privacy

267
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,500
or endanger public safety,

268
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,100
that's not a

269
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,380
violation of the law.

270
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,460
But

we could find Zoey or not these days.

275
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,220
Let me ask you something,

276
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,580
can you log in to this software

277
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,820
on different devices at the same time?

278
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,940
If you ask other people,

279
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
that's a no.

280
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,780
But if you ask me,

281
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,140
that's a yes.

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,260
Then thank you.

283
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,820
You are welcome.

284
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,900
I will send messages

285

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:49,940
Great.

288
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,660

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,100
about the CCTV in the zoo at night,

356
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,770
should we

357
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,820
plan a schedule?

358
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,620
Who will watch it?

359
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,860
Maybe later.

360
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,180
It seems that

361
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,490
it's kind of competitive in the first two days' slot.

362
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,170
It's detailed for hours.

363
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,580
Probably

364
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,140
we won't have our turn.

365
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,740
Do your thing.

366
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,300
Rest assured.

367
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,300
Mother.

368
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,260
Are you still watching?

369
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,860
Stop.

370
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,490
It's late at night.

371
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,260
Time to sleep.

372
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,140
Let's go to sleep.

373
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,580
You little brat.

374
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,980
Are you responsible

375
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,020
for 8 to 10 p.m.?

376
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,260
It's 10:30 now.

377
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,370
Someone else is watching.

378
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,380
Someone else?

379
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,780
Are they careful enough?

380
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,700
What if they miss a clip?

381
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,620
They are very responsible.

382
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,940
Don't worry. Just go to sleep.

383
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,140
Also,

384
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,290
an entrepreneur like you

385
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,100
are like

386
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,020
a pupil.

387
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,060
If they know,

388
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,940
who will spend money at your place?

389
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,220
You know nothing.

390
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,900
It's called doing things by ourselves.

391
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,300
Do you know why our shopping market

392
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,100
can succeed?

393
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,900
It's because of this spirit.

394
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,020
I know.

395
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,500
You are still watching, uncle?

396
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,380
Haven't you go to sleep?

397
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,020
That's OK.

398
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,420
I am a night owl.

399
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,460
It's only 12:00 now.

400
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,300
OK.

401
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,620
But take care of yourself.

402
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,620
Sleep early.

403
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,580
I'm going to sleep now.

404
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:05,980
OK.

405
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,820
Good night.

406
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,260
Good night.

407
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,820
What?

408
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,800
Shh.

409
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,890
Be quiet.

410
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,700
Uncle is outside.

411
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,290
I'm telling you,

412
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,380
uncle

413
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:47,900
took up my place.

414
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,780
I can't sleep with Bai Lingling.

415
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,580
Right?

416
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,100
I've thought it through.

417
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
I decided to make it up for one night with you.

418
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,180
What are you thinking about?

419
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,860
Playing the innocent?

420
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,850
Get up.

421
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,060
Don't play victim with me.

422
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,780
Get off.

423
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,580
Stinky feet.

424
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,180
Stinky feet.

425
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,180
Don't pull my pants down.

426
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,460
My underwear is out.

427
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Will you get off or not?

428
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,610
Uncle, uncle.

429
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,380
You are a piece of work.

430
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,980
Ouyang Yifan,

431
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,020
aren't you getting off the bed?

432
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,100
Get off.

433
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,860
Will you get off or not?

434
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,460
Get off.

435
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,420
What would you do?

436
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,410
Out!

437
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,500
Off!

438
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,300
I deliberately gave way to you.

439
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,340
Do really really think

440
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,220
I can't fight with you?

441
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,660
Ouyang Yifan.

442
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,130
Ouyang Yifan.

443
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,820
That hurts.

444
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,140
I now inform you.

445
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,460
I, Ouyang Yifan,

446
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,500
am sleeping here tonight.

447
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,660
I.

448
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,060
Stop.

449
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,380
Are you bullying me?

450
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,060
Are you bullying me?

451
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,100
Did you tickle me?

452
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,900
No.

453
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,420
Sorry.

454
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,620
Sorry.

455
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,730
What do you want?

456
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,570
I want to be in your bed.

457
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,770
What is it?

458
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,780
So abrupt.

459
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,540
You can sleep with me.

460
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,460
But I have to

461
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,700
write papers overnight.

462
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,850
And I have to watch the camera.

463
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,500
Are you afraid of noises?

464
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,500
I might wake you up.

465
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,460
What if

466
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,900
I stay up all night, too?

467
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,220
Lingling.

468
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,740
You can tell your uncle

469
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,340
to get him back.

470
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,340
I'll stay here.

471
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,700
It's a pity that he sleeps on the couch.

472
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,820
Don't mention it.

473
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,220
I told him the entire afternoon.

474
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,780
He didn't listen.

475
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,100
He said

476
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,740
it's okay if we can't go to the zoo,

477
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,660
but we must see

478
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,340
the camera carefully. It's so easy.

479
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,260
He insisted.

480
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,570
And Yang Lanhang.

481
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,300
He almost got into a fight

482
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,890
because of the camera.

483
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,180
Whatever.

484
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,250
OK.

485
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,700
What's wrong?

486
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,060
It's about 1 a.m.,

487
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,460
it's Zoey's

488
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,780
favorite sports time.

489
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,460
I will be out to watch the camera.

490
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,620
Luckily, granny doesn't know.

491
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,380
If she ever knows, she will fight with me.

492
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,380
Don't mention it. I'm telling you,

493
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,260
she and some other old ladies

494
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,140
are playing Mahjong in the nursing home.

495
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,460
They are having so much fun.

496
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,780
Really?

497
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,210
Lingling.

498
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,020
Lingling.

499
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,020
Come and see.

500
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,020
Is it Zoey?

501
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,180
Go! Go!

502
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,500
Lingling, is it that?

503
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,460
Yes.

504
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,260
It really is that monkey.

505
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,140
I told you!

506
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,500
I know it is still alive!

507
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,340
Right?

508
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,860
Thank you, dad.

509
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:39,910
[Yang Lanhang  Shameless  Tortoise and Dog  Shame on Both of You]

510
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,300
Zoey was found,

511
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,660
and I was also criticized

512
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,820
for installing the camera.

513
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,580
This thing should

514
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,820
have been in the past.

515
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,100
Yeah.

516
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,020
The lab's been notified

517
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,620
to be unsealed.

518
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,340
And then we can

519
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,340
continue our clinical trials.

520
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,780
You know what? Zheng Minghao,

521
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,580
I really owe it to you this time.

522
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,490
I haven't thought of it if you didn't mention it.

523
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
But now that you say it,

524
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,020
I thought you'd like to

525
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,370
treat me to a meal

526
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,100
because I did you such a big favor.

527
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,980
I can't believe you

528
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,140
invited me over to paint

529
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,930
his house.

530
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,260
Are you afraid

531
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,500
I haven't been hurt enough?

532
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
He is busy cooking for us

533
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,340
in the kitchen now.

534
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,660
Listen to me.

535
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,420
You can torture him as much as you like

536
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,700
and let him serve you after the meal.

537
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,220
I think you

538
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,540
pulled that stunt because

539
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,460
you were afraid he'd be jealous.

540
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,180
He wouldn't have a chance

541
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,980
to blame me if I

542
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,860
came and worked for him.

543
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,100
Yang lanhang isn't so narrow-minded,

544
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,860
he said you are handsome the other day.

545
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,660
He?

546
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,220
Said I was handsome?

547
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,500
He told me that

548
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,460
the most handsome moment

549
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,780
when a man is in

550
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,900
his area of expertise.

551
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,300
He also said you made him feel threatened.

552
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,620
Did he say that?

553
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,380
Why would I lie to you?

554
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,180
You can go in there

555
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,340
and ask him yourself.

556
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,940
I mean...

557
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,940
How to say?

558
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,580
He is also handsome.

559
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,140
To tell you the truth.

560
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,980
I'm relieved to see

561
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,060
you two get together.

562
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,290
You said it as if

563
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,380
you were my father.

564
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:04,900
Trust me.

565
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,100
I think my own dad would also think you

566
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,140
are my dad after hearing your words.

567
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,260
It looks like you and your dad

568
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,140
are on good terms now.

569
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,300
Pretty good.

570
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,580
It was Yang Lanhang who let me know

571
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,700
something from the past.

572
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,860
So,

573
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,730
I'm not so entangled anymore.

574
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,420
I remember that I checked your profile

575
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,500
furtively when I first met you.

576
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,860
You wrote in the former name column,

577
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,180
"Shi Nuoling".

578
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,260
Then, I went to

579
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,620
see your family

580
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,780
background stealthily.

581
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,660
That's when I thought

582
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,940
I wanted to protect this girl

583
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,980
from being hurt.

584
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,580
But now it seems that

585
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,020
what you need is not protection,

586
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,570
but reconciliation.

587
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,940
No wonder I lost to him.

588
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,820
What lost!

589
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,620
Listen to me.

590
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,140
Zheng Minghao,

591
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,380
you'll definitely meet

592
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,460
a really nice girl someday

593
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,140
whom you love very much.

594
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,180
And when that happens,

595
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,220
you'll be glad you didn't

596
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,740
take advantage of me now.

597
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,380
Alright. Let's not talk about it.

598
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,860
I think we're

599
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,900
almost done.

600
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,860
Let's eat first.

601
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,660
After the meal,

602
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,220
I'll ask Yang Lanhang to do it by himself.

603
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,020
Go.

604
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Bai Lingling.

605
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,220
Even though I said I wouldn't give up,

606
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,170
I'm telling you

607
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,060
on the record,

608
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,100
I don't like you anymore.

609
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,420
Congratulations!

610
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,890
May you find a girl

611
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,700
who is prettier than me soon.

612
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,500
Are we still friends?

613
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,900
You bet. Come in and eat.

614
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,900
[Biosafety Laboratory]

615
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,770
We finally came back.

616
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,260
Zhang,

617
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,060
why don't we get a brazier and jump on it?

618
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,500
Open fires are prohibited in the laboratory.

619
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:47,940
Go.

620
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,690
Lanhang,

621
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,300
the school leaders have asked me

622
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,500
to express our apologies

623
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,860
to you on behalf of the school.

624
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
We are sorry

625
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
to have wronged you.

626
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,020
That's okay.

627
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,610
Everything has been figured out.

628
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,780
It's more important that

629
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,380
our experiments can go on.

630
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,700
Right.

631
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
There were so many people

632
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,060
abusing us.

633
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,140
What about now?

634
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,260
They must be embarrassed!

635
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,420
I wanna see

636
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,020
what else they will say.

637
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,940
What happened?

638
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,730
Why do so many people

639
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,700
still curse guru?

640
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,540
Their words are

641
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,820
even worse than before.

642
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,010
[He can even control others live or die! He escaped the justice of law!]

643
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,810
"He is worthy of being the master of a large corporate group,

644
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,640
he can even revive

645
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,640
a death monkey."

646
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,910
"Controlling life and death,

647
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,160
even the law cannot bring him to justice!"

648
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,490
What nonsense!

649
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,200
What's wrong with this guy!

650
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,740
What?

651
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,820
Why are you so angry?

652
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,090
Let me see.

653
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,180
I think that

654
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,540
they are

655
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,460
oversimplifying

656
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,860
the matter.

657
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,580
It's true that Zoey's still alive,

658
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,340
we have achieved

659
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,690
a phased victory.

660
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,060
Our clinical trials can continue,

661
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,900
and the lab can also

662
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,260
operate normally.

663
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,460
But

664
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,100
this won't be over until

665
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,700
we find out who's

666
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,100
behind this.

667
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,740
By the way,

668
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,540
what about that Tang Shun?

669
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,940
Yeah.

670
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,140
I almost forgot if you didn't tell me.

671
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,860
Didn't you say he'd be here

672
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,740
one of these days begging for

673
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,340
our forgiveness on his knees?

674
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,900
It seemed that what you said

675
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,060
wasn't so reliable.

676
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,300
Or maybe

677
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,300
our acting skills were so awful

678
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,380
that had been seen through by them?

679
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,700
Whatever.

680
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,860
We've given him a chance.

681
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,980
The lawyer's letter will be sent to his house

682
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,160
in half an hour.

683
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,460
I have told you so many times that

684
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,780
I have already given up.

685
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,460
I got a ton of guys chasing me,

686
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,580
so I don't need to hang

687
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,940
on to Yang Lanhang.

688
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,500
You know what? Just stop it.

689
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,660
Stop doing those

690
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,700
nasty things.

691
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,820
I did nothing.

692
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,380
I have nothing

693
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:10,820
to do with

694
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,980
the whole thing now.

695
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,140
It's completely pushed by netizens spontaneously.

696
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,260
OK.

697
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,060
Then let me ask you.

698
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,740
What can I do

699
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,740
to make this go away?

700
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,220
How much money do you want?

701
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,140
Give me a price.

702
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,220
Miss Li,

703
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,660
don't be silly.

704
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,940
Money can't

705
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,890
solve anything at

706
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,900
this stage.

707
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,820
Well, I want everyone to know that

708
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,940
you directed all of this.

709
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,140
I didn't do this on my own,

710
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,480
but both of us.

711
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,060
What do you want?

712
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,980
I wanna milk tea.

713
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,010
Milk tea?

714
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,540
Aren't you afraid of gaining weight?

715
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,340
Do you think I'm fat?

716
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:58,780
No.

717
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,600
I think you...

718
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,460
...you are slim.

719
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,180
I wanna three cups.

720
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,020
Please wait a minute.

721
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,860
It's you!

722
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,980
Mr. Yang.

723
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,940
Miss Bai.

724
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,020
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

725
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,380
I really didn't expect that

726
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,620
this issue would cause an uproar.

727
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,100
I got confused temporarily

728
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
and was blinded by money.

729
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,380
I had been fired

730
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,670
by the zoo.

731
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,510
Look,

732
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,150
please don't sue me.

733
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,030
I don't know anything

734
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,750
about what happened.

735
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,560
Someone else put me up to it.

736
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,450
You, you should sue her.

737
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,830
Sue her?

738
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,220
Who?

739
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,570
That actress.

740
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,590
Li Feifei.

741
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,070
Monkey Mountain in the zoo

742
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,000
is not an

743
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,000
important area.

744
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,390
No one pays attention.

745
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,270
Spend some money to

746
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,990
make them talk nonsense.

747
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,380
That's easy.

748
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,810
You also bought the trolls?

749
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,650
Yes.

750
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,620
I will make you a list

751
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,840
about every expense details

752
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,310
after this thing is over.

753
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,570
I'm not asking you about this.

754
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,790
Do you remember

755
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,550
what I told you?

756
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,400
You said you were busy.

757
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,410
You have no intention to know how.

758
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,090
You just give me the money.

759
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,520
Only if Yang Lanhang

760
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,080
would be back to you.

761
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,480
You don't need to hear the rest.

762
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,340
That's almost all about it.

763
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,230
I can send you the full version.

764
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,810
What are the conditions?

765
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,150
No.

766
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,010
You are not the only one who is great in this world.

767
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,560
Wait.

768
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,210
Have you ever thought about

769
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,850
what would happen to you

770
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,820
if this record is circulated?

771
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,590
Of course.

772
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,900
Do you really think that

773
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,110
I'm innocent

774
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,840
and easy to be tricked?

775
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,220
When I decided to give

776
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,200
this recording to you,

777
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,300
I've already put my entire reputation

778
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,770
and career on the line.

779
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,540
But don't worry.

780
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,630
I do this

781
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,970
neither for Yang Lanhang

782
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,160
nor for myself

783
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,590
to set a character setting.

784
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,980
I don't think any of that matters to me

785
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,620
compared to defending the dignity

786
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,720
and justice of science research.

787
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,400
I'll go.

788
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,830
Did your new film

789
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,590
be selected for the

790
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,640
international film festival?

791
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,400
I wonder if the audience can vote?

792
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,990
His face is opposite

793
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,790
to his heart.

794
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,670
Look at Wang Tao,

795
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,890
this thing has tested out his true nature.

796
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,530
It seemed that Li Feifei was also involved.

797
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,410
Really?

798
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:26,960
Yeah.

799
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,880
Oh, that's so refreshing.

800
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,640
You bet.

801
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,230
They deserve it.

802
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:29,980
Yes.

803
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,750
Did Li Feifei get involved in this thing?

804
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,590
Is that true?

805
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,510
I heard it's true.

806
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,310
Stop talking.

807
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,290
I didn't know he was such a person.

808
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,340
He's gone too far.

809
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,640
Yeah.

810
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,440
Look at me.

811
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,000
Are you Wang Tao?

812
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,110
How could he say it like that?

813
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,070
Now everything is okay.

814
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,330
The truth finally came out

815
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,590
and the bad guys have been caught.

816
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,890
It's really gratifying!

817
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,310
In fact, Wang Tao is also pretty miserable.

818
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,760
He was fired before he even

819
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,710
got hired because of a video.

820
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,000
Later he found a couple of jobs,

821
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,980
but none of them worked out.

822
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,040
And then he got into

823
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,920
that game company because

824
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,970
he was free of salary.

825
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,240
Till now, he can't afford the rent

826
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,710
and is also in debt.

827
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,550
Yeah.

828
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,350
If he had lived a better life,

829
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,420
he would not have

830
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,350
done such

831
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,750
unconscionable things.

832
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,830
When did you come here?

833
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,690
Who do you think bought the milk tea?

834
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,440
No wonder.

835
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,910
I saw Ouyang pick off the sign

836
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,380
"Forbidden Area for Zheng Minghao"

837
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,310
early this morning.

838
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,750
After all, we've

839
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,750
fought together,

840
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,470
right?

841
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,750
You just said that

842
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,390
Wang Tao was fired

843
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,520
because of a video.

844
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,120
Who shot it?

845
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,050
I don't know.

846
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,650
Is that you, Lingling?

847
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,949
That's impossible!

848
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,800
I was so frightened at that time.

849
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,800
I didn't dare to

850
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,400
take any videos.

851
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,080
Who was it then?

852
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,230
I did it.

853
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,340
Isn't it right to blow the whistle

854
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,179
on such bad behavior?

855
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,330
Right. You're right.

856
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,420
You are the best.

857
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,350
Alright.

858
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,150
We're done with the gossip.

859
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,960
After drinking milk tea,

860
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,949
let's go back to work.

861
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,560
OK.

862
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,810
I'll leave then.

863
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,370
Bye.

864
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,250
I won't see you out then.

865
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,350
-Bye.
-Thank you for your milk tea.

866
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,270
Bye.

♫ Neither of us wanted to climb over ♫

878
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:00,530
♫ I stand on the terrace of your shadow ♫

879
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,300
♫ Wind blew and sea rippled ♫

880
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,970
♫ Everything was ♫

881
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,250
♫ Exactly covered by memories ♫

882
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,720
They...

883
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,980
I know what you want to say.

884
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,330
You wanna know what he is thinking.

885
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,380
I have a method.

886
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,570
Isn't it the bracelet of the locker room?

887
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,200
Yeah.

888
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,550
But it's a little different.

889
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,770
I have implanted

890
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,480
a joint program in it.

891
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,450
As long as his heart rate is

892
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,030
a little abnormal

893
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,380
and exceeds standard level,

894
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,340
his bracelet will have a

895
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,600
synchronous vibration with mine.

896
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,120
So what we should think is,

897
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,210
how to get Ouyang

898
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,510
to wear this bracelet.

899
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,310
This is familiar.

900
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,000
I see you're worried about them,

901
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,180
so I made it just now.

902
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,210
Look at me.

903
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,590
No.

904
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,280
I'll go to work.

905
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,780
What a surprise.

906
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,010
You not only sent the video

907
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,150
but also made the bracelet.

908
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,370
Why did you do so many things

909
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,010
to chase me?

910
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,320
I always work hard

911
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,040
at everything I do.

912
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,740
OK.

913
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,290
Let's go.

914
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,470
Morning.

915
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,560
I'm waiting for you.

916
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,040
[Biosafety Laboratory]

917
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,550
Thank you...senior.

918
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,730
Jing, are you okay?

919
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,730
Sorry.

920
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,620
I'm okay.

921
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:38,960
Be careful.

922
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,770
Are you alright?

923
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,640
How about now?

924
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,740
Do you want to wear it?

925
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,880
My hands have been numb from the shaking

926
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,190
for the past two days.

927
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,050
I didn't expect that.

928
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,870
I thought

929
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,200
the twin brothers were totally different.

930
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,630
Actually they are the same!

931
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,350
It's just one in light and

932
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,190
the other in the dark.

933
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,330
Yeah.

934
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,210
Come on.

935
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,770
I won't.

936
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,070
How can I feel

937
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,620
other men's heartbeat?

938
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,670
You wear it.

939
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,860
You've got the point.

940
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,880
Then would you like to

941
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,640
feel my heartbeat?

942
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,530
Let me listen to it.

943
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,930
It was Ouyang who

944
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,730
told you the things about me.

945
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,790
Yes.

946
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,760
At that time, I only gave him

947
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,320
your name "Bai Lingling",

948
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,170
then he paid attention to it for half a month.

949
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,130
He said,

950
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,270
In the first semester of your senior year,

951
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,360
you were actually ready to take the

952
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,070
postgraduate entrance exam.

953
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,090
But then you gave up.

954
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,190
No wonder you have already known I was going to

955
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,570
take the postgraduate exam.

956
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,510
So it was him who

957
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,930
gave you the photo?

958
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,110
Yes.

959
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,090
Being reliable,

960
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,230
not asking questions

961
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,530
and can keep secrets.

962
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,690
There were no other

963
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,920
choices but him.

964
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,910
But looking at his character,

965
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,830
he is too hesitant.

966
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,680
His heart was beating so fast,

967
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,190
and the bracelet was also shaking.

968
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,530
But he acted on his face

969
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,920
like nothing

970
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,090
had happened.

971
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,240
Why do you feel like

972
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,080
a sister-in-law when you're

973
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,600
not even married yet?

974
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,390
To help our brother

975
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,570
find a wife.

976
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,170
What are you saying!

977
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,170
I don't!

978
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,810
I haven't agreed to marry you.

979
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,030
Won't you marry me?

980
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,880
We'll talk about it later.

981
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,860
Didn't we make a deal that

982
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,410
we'll be together just like a dog with a turtle.

983
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,840
I don't want to be a turtle

984
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,140
or a dog.

985
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,640
Then what do you want?

986
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:28,640
What time is it?

987
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,320
It's almost ten thirty.

988
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,620
He is currently engaged

989
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,330
in a new project,

990
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,350
so he must be working overtime at this hour.

991
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,120
I wonder if

992
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,660
he can still focus on his project

993
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,610
when he's shocked like this?

994
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,380
I see.

995
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,010
In such a beautiful place,

996
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,230
I decided to

997
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,470
just let it go.

998
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,870
I have an idea.
