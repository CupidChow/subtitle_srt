00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,580
What a naughty girl!

180
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,770
That's ridiculous.

181
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,740
You have no idea

182
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,660
who I work my ass off

183
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,860
for every day.

184
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,900
You are partial to the outsider!

185
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,810
My heart was in vain,

186
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,980
Ms. Wu!

187
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,380
You are bustling without plan!

188
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,500
He is working on

189
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,540
something meaningful.

190
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,980
Yang has told me that

191
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,060
their research goes well.

192
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
They will conduct

193
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,180
animal experiments soon.

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,580
Then it'll be my turn

195
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,700
as soon as the experiment is successful.

196
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,500
We'll talk about it later.

197
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,860
I haven't agreed yet.

198
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,420
I won't listen to you on this matter.

199
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,020
It's up to him.

200
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,930
He studies better than you.

201
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,180
You should

202
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,060
consider more about your marriage.

203
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,580
Better than me?

204
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,940
How much?

205
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,180
Am I that bad?

206
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,940
Besides,

207
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,860
nothing could be more meaningful

208
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,780
than my experiments

209
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,660
in the lab!

210
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,700
You have already passed the postgraduate entrance exam.

211
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,780
Now you should let yourself

212
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,020
take a break now.

213
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,020
Go for a walk

214
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,900
or fall in love with someone.

215
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,700
The young man called Zheng we met last time is pretty good.

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,020
Do you know him?

217
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,060
I think he is a really good person.

218
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:57,700
I know him.

219
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,060
But I think he is not suitable.

220
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,710
Maybe you can take another look.

221
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,100
Not suitable?

222
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,020
Not suitable.

223
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,250
Not suitable...

224
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,460
I believe in

225
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,940
what you said.

226
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,100
Well,

227
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,460
as an elder

228
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,100
of Lingling,

229
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,130
can you find a better boyfriend

230
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,660
for her?

231
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,650
No problem.

232
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:20,750
Well.

233
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,860
Wait, wait a minute.

234
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,740
He is just a few years older than me.

235
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,860
How could he be my elder?

236
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,200
The elders are just like your father.

237
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,250
Two elders.

238
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,780
Brat.

239
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,010
What are you laughing at?

240
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,980
Nothing.

241
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,140
Guru asked me out.

242
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,280
Maybe it's about

243
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,360
going to Shenzhen.

244
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,220
Can't you talk about it on Wechat?

245
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Why does he want to see you in person?

246
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,060
Maybe there's something else.

247
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,650
After all, I have lots of Reiki.

248
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,740
He could find a way to solve the problem

249
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,070
just by taking a look at me.

250
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,180
Shut up.

251
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,060
Zhang,

252
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,300
don't you want to go to Shenzhen?

253
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,260
Be honest with me.

254
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,180
You are pretending that you don't want to

255
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,180
go to Shenzhen because you know

256
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
you won't

257
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,340
have the chance,

258
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,180
right?

259
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,580
Let me tell you.

260
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,380
The original plan was that

261
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,660
Lanhang and I would go with the Professor.

262
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,540
But I gave up the chance

263
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,420
on my own initiative

264
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,970
because I have more important things to do.

265
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,020
Your story

266
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,280
sounds better than

267
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,180
you pretending that you don't want to.

268
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,700
It's true.

269
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,060
Impossible.

270
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,940
Nothing could be more important than

271
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,380
taking part in the seminar.

272
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,940
Of course!

273
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,900
My wife came back.

274
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,100
Are you married?

275
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,440
It's normal.

276
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,920
[My Lovely Princess]

277
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,140
Zhang Yi'an!

278
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,380
I told you that

279
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,290
I rescheduled the flight.

280
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,050
[My Lovely Princess]

281
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,300
Are you busy with your experiments and

282
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,220
haven't checked your phone?

283
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,380
I'm at the airport.

284
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,260
Let's get divorced

285
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,060
if you don't show up

286
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,620
in five minutes!

287
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,260
Still so cute.

288
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,740
Zhang,

289
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,300
did I hear it wrong?

290
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,980
She will divorce you.

291
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Why are you still here and drinking coffee?

292
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,180
Go and pick her up quickly!

293
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
The airport is too far.

294
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,540
I can't arrive in five minutes.

295
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,260
I won't go.

296
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,820
You won't?

297
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,420
Brat.

298
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,620
The relationship in marriage

299
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,220
is delicate and complicated.

300
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,010
Take my wife and I for example.

301
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,420
We always have a balance by default.

302
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,420
Even if now she stands

303
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,540
in front of me and tells me,

304
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,260
'Zhang Yi'an,

305
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,500
I will divorce you

306
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,980
if you still engage in your scientific research.'

307
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,220
But both of us know clearly

308
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,370
that we can never

309
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,340
separate from each other.

310
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
I can't understand it.

311
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,620
Whatever.

312
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,180
I don't want to get married.

313
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,980
I just want to soak myself in scientific research.

314
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,380
I'll go to find guru.

315
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
Doctor Li.

316
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,900
You are here.

317
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,020
Where is guru?

318
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
He is not here.

319
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,900
So why did he ask me here?

320
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,980
Here is the thing.

321
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,700
Tomorrow

322
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
we'll have animal experiments

323
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,780
for the new materials.

324
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,540
We are short of people.

325
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,540
So I asked Lanhang

326
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,340
for your help.

327
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,820
Tomorrow?

328
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,380
But I'm going to Shenzhen tomorrow.

329
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,860
Only Lanhang will go to Shenzhen

330
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,860
with Professor Jiang.

331
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,060
There's still one place left.

332
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
The place was

333
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,620
given to Professor Qi.

334
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,180
What?

335
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,970
So these gaps are there

336
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,860
for the cells to grow.

337
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:43,740
Yes.

338
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,420
Ouyang and I

339
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,220
have tried it several times.

340
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,010
We successfully printed a mixture

341
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,020
of cells and scaffolds.

342
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,100
Then what we should do now

343
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,480
is to culture the cells

344
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,180
in the bioreactor

345
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,100
and let them grow

346
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
into what we designed.

347
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,570
The biological tissue

348
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,780
is really interesting.

349
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,580
It must be cultivated in

350
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,940
a similar hemodynamic environment

351
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,740
in order to grow into

352
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,540
corresponding

353
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,930
mechanical strength.

354
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,220
We also need to test

355
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,900
the degradation of the scaffold.

356
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,380
If the sheep tests

357
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,380
by Doctor Li

358
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,180
go well,

359
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:12,860
we can start primate tests

360
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,940
right away.

361
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,540
I just think that

362
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,150
it will take a long time

363
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,340
from shooting to design

364
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,690
and to printing and

365
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,820
cultivating.

366
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,620
If there's some emergency patient

367
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,260
who needs a valve replacement surgery right away,

368
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,220
this kind of

369
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,700
advanced customization method

370
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,460
could be,

371
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,140
could be too late.

372
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:31,950
Yes.

373
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,430
Every technology

374
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,980
has its limitations.

375
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,820
That's why science needs to

376
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,060
keep moving forward.

377
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,420
That's right.

378
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,420
Oh,

379
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,700
I forgot to ask. What'd you like to drink?

380
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,160
As you like.

381
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,220
As I like?

382
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,210
Well, okay.

383
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,100
So that's where your

384
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,420
smell came from!

385
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,380
I mean, why do all of the

386
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,580
young scientists

387
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,300
like jasmine?

388
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,460
Is there anything special about this?

389
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,300
Who else likes it?

390
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,340
My boyfriend.

391
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,220
He keeps telling me that.

392
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,500
What he said is exactly like

393
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,100
this scene right now.

394
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,540
He said he was going to

395
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,060
grow a little jasmine like this

396
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,660
in a sunny place

397
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,020
on the balcony

398
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,500
facing south.

399
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,700
I guess the most similar thing

400
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,660
between your boyfriend and I

401
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,460
isn't just that we are

402
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,180
young scientists.

403
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,220
We're both lazy.

404
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,500
Why would you say that?

405
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,500
Do you know that

406
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,780
jasmine is easy to grow?

407
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,660
Even though it looks so fragile,

408
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,060
it's very easy to grow.

409
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,460
After being exposed to

410
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,380
strong sunshine all day,

411
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,020
it only needs a little water at night

412
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,530
and will be back to vibrant again soon.

413
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,300
So it's also called

414
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,180
"Undead Jasmine"

415
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,890
What kind of tea are you brewing?

416
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,270
Jasmine tea.

417
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,620
You can even do this!

418
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,710
Just boiling and purifying.

419
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,940
It couldn't be

420
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,180
too difficult for us.

421
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,020
Come on,

422
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,660
have a try.

423
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,780
I'm back.

424
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,010
Lingling?

425
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,810
Why are you here?

426
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,100
Did Guan Xiaoyu

427
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,100
break up with that guy?

428
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,620
Well... I don't think so...

429
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,380
That's okay.

430
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,460
You don't need to answer him.

431
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,730
Shouldn't you get up early tomorrow morning?

432
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Go home and have a rest.

433
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,660
Yes, yes.

434
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,540
I'll go home now.

435
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,930
Bye. Bye.

436
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,140
We are allies.

437
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,500
Remember to tell me if

438
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,010
they break up.

439
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,140
OK, sure.

440
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,460
What's going on?

441
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,340
You're gonna go out with Yang Lanhang?

442
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,690
You make such

443
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,180
quick progress!

444
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,020
Just, just go to work.

445
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,460
I know that you're going to work.

446
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,740
I mean,

447
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,980
I am seeing

448
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,940
you two

449
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:08,930
from foes

450
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,260
to intimate friends.

451
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,380
You changed so quickly!

452
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,900
Actually,

453
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,900
after I got along with him

454
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,940
for a period of time,

455
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:18,980
I found that

456
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,300
he is really a nice person.

457
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,700
And also,

458
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,740
now I can fully understand

459
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,060
why he interrupted me

460
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,980
on my graduation paper defense.

461
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,060
He's a person of

462
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,780
scientific cleanliness.

463
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
He insisted on cutting me off

464
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,860
when I said

465
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,460
the wrong data.

466
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,420
It's his conditioned reflex.

467
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,780
He didn't aim at me.

468
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,620
Alright. Alright.

469
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,120
Everything you say is right.

470
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,340

Ouyang Yifan?

474
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,100
Why did he send a message to you?

475
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,420
Did he fall in

476

love with you?

477
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,850
His...

478
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,980
It was just an

479
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,980
accidental chance.

480
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,060
We added each other's Wechat.

I forgot to tell you.

482

I'll reply to him.

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,500
OK. OK.

Does she know how to scold others?

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,140
Look!

Tell me.

I can pass over they gave the place to another person.

495

Why couldn't I go to

Shenzhen at my own expense,

497

but she could?

498
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,740
I have to leave here

and be an assistant to someone else.

500

I didn't expect to see you here!

506

We are here for a conference.

This is Professor Jiang.

I'll go to my room and have a rest.

I'm going to my room, too.

you can have a rest first.

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,340
I'll call you

What do you want for dinner?

I know a lot about Shenzhen.

Do you need any recommendations?

523
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,300
There is a French restaurant

that is particularly good.

525
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,900
But you need to make a reservation

we can get a reservation right now.

530
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,900
I'm well acquainted with

531
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,020
the chef in that restaurant.

532
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,660
Maybe I can ask him to

533
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,780
leave you a table slinkingly.

534
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,100
Good. Thank you for your help.

535
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,220
You're welcome.

536
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,580
It's my pleasure.

537
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,820
So, why are you here?

538
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,220
We are shooting a film.

539
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,020
Our crew

540
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,420
rented it from above the 19th floor.

541
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,260
I think it's a little noisy,

542
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,620
so I just moved to this floor.

543
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,540
I didn't expect to see you here.

544
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,940
Isn't it a coincidence?

545
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,900
We are destined to meet each other again.

546
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,300
You must be tired just getting off the plane.

547
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,780
I won't bother you anymore.

548
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,220
You can go and have a rest.

549
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,450
I'll let you know after I make a reservation.

550
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,740
Thank you.

551
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,140
Then I'll go back to my room.

552
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,640
Sure.

553
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,650
Bye.

554
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,220
Bye.

555
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,050
Go.

556
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,860
Baby, who is he?

557
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,700
[Heart of Gate]

558
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,850
[Forever is for Ever]

559
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,650
What are you doing?

560
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,100
I just arrived at the hotel.

561
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,020
What's wrong?

562
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,100
[Forever is for Ever]

563
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,960
Nothing. I miss you.

564
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,690
Fortunately, this phone has a voice change function.

565
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:51,660
Hello?

566
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,750
What's your plan later?

567
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,770
Well.

568
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,130
You are

569
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,350
Forever is for Ever?

570
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,330
You...

571
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,050
You...

572
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,360
How do you know my phone number?

573
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,660
Do you forget about it?

574
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,880
I bought you porridge.

575
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,640
So I got your number

576
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,520
and your address.

577
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,280
Oh right.

578
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,980
That's a surprise that

579
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,530
you called me.

580
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,430
Like I said,

581
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,640
I,

582
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,860
I kind of miss you.

583
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,470
What is it?

584
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,160
Nothing.

585
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,590
I.

586
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,190
I.

587
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,110
I just didn't imagine

588
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,620
you would

589
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,900
call me abruptly.

590
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,650
I.

591
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,670
I think you have a nice voice,

592
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,550
for real.

593
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,360
Well,

594
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,790
your voice

595
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,720
sounds very familiar to me.

596
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,950
It's really me.

597
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,180
What did you just ask me about?

598
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,360
I'm so nervous that

599
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,030
I forgot about it.

600
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,750
You asked me

601
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,050
what's the plan later on, right?

602
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,060
I just arrived at the hotel and then

603
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,900
let me tell you something.

604
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,040
There are many delicious foods in Shenzhen.

605
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,130
And I've made some

606
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,390
preparations before arriving.

607
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,610
I just want to

608
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,790
have some local food

609
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,140
and do some shopping.

610
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,230
But I don't want to

611
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,950
eat out with Yang Lanhang and his friend.

612
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,000
I was thinking,

613
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:54,880
I would like to find an excuse later on.

614
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,350
After Yang Lanhang and his friend leave,

615
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,610
I'll sneak out.

616
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,870
Don't,

617
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,680
don't you dine out with him?

618
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,860
Yang Lanhang's girlfriend is coming,

619
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,700
the star that

620
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,130
I was talking about last time.

621
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,270
Although he didn't admit it last time,

622
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,910
I came to realize that

623
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,250
maybe he was trying to protect her girlfriend's career.

624
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,560
What do you think?

625
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,110
So it's understandable.

626
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,550
Really? He?

627
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,720
Of course.

628
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,520
I'm telling you.

629
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,070
I don't misjudge people.

630
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:19,960
They were making eye contacts

631
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,010
when they exited the elevator.

632
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,250
Yang Lanhang was so excited

633
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,170
and happy.

634
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,660
For real.

635
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,790
I saw it right away.

636
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,100
They can't fool me.

637
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,540
So I think

638
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,200
I shouldn't be

639
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,250
the third wheel.

640
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:30,790
Let them be

641
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,930
happy ever after.

642
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,150
I'll take this chance to

643
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,320
eat food that I like.

644
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,660
I'm telling you.

645
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,630
I saw a video online

646
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,270
about

647
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,660
the sea urchins,

648
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,040
foie gras and beef with rice which

649
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,820
are absolutely fresh.

650
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,430
Moreover...

651
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,930
Am I being too

652
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,400
talkative?

653
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,510
I'm just too excited.

654
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,860
No.

655
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,830
Actually I'm a little bit nervous, too.

656
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,990
Would you like it

657
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,480
if I call you more often?

658
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,530
OK.

659
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,950
You might

660
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,460
waste some money

661
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,350
making international calls.

662
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,380
I don't think you should

663
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,460
spend money like that when studying abroad.

664
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,260
How about this?

665
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,650
I will also try to make money.

666
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,820
And I will also call you.

667
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,680
You call me one time,

668
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,300
and next time I'll call you, OK?

669
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,560
No.

670
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,540
Not that you should not call me.

671
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,210
Yes.

672
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,960
Try to be frugal.

673
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:32,780
Well,

674
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,670
I'm hanging up.

675
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,100
OK.

676
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,320
Have fun then.

677
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,920
OK.

678
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,680
Bye.

679
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,430
Bye.

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,590
should we check on her?

703
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,910
No, thanks.

704
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,680
The chef gave me response.

705
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,820
He has prepared

706
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,820
a table for me for four.

707
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,000
Sounds great?

708
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,300
Sorry.

709
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,390
I didn't have time to tell you that

710
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,950
I was planning to eat somewhere else.

711
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,170
As an apology,

712
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,050
you can be with your friends.

713
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,140
It's all on me.

714
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,250
OK.

715
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,590
I'm leaving then.

716
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:05,680
Bye.

717
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,690
Bye.

718
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,890
Are you cleaning or

719
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,770
sabotaging?

720
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,170
I am wondering,

721
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,340
why am I doing all of

722
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,260
Bai Lingling's work?

723
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,730
You are the least experienced

724
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,570
and youngest.

725
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,250
Who else?

726
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,090
Professors?

727
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,760
Take things seriously.

728
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,350
You are the genius of the School of Materials.

729
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,590
You are not qualified enough for a seminar,

730
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,270
but you should be more qualified for cleaning

731
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,860
than Bai Lingling.

732
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,830
Cheers.

733
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,370
Zhang.

734
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,730
Why are you like this?

735
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,210
Are you here for the first day?

736
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,530
Let me handle this.

737
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,830
I thought you would

738
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,920
find Doctor Li later on.

739
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,020
Senior Jing, you are so nice to me.

740
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,660
Stop buttering me up.

741
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,920
It's because Ouyang's experiment

742
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,390
is in tomorrow morning.

743
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,160
If I don't help you now,

744
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,050
you two would definitely fight about it.

745
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,980
Why do you think the same as Zhang?

746
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,330
You also don't have confidence in me?

747
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,460
I'm telling you.

748
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,560
Someday,

749
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,330
I will be a

750
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,330
top-tier

751
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,290
scientist.

752
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,010
You will be impressed.

753
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,940
Mr. Scientist,

754
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,990
if you don't leave now,

755
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,250
clean it up by yourself.

756
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,890
I'm leaving.

757
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,150
Thank you Senior Jing.

758
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,660
Love you.

759
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,630
Senior.

760
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,410
[Huaihai Boitech]

761
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,800
Senior.

762
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,770
Haven't you left?

763
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,260
The keys...

764
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,170
The keys are missing?

765
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,590
I'll help you find them.

766
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,400
Have you found the keys?

767
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,560
You are making a decent amount of

768
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,030
money with a bonus.

769
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,090
Can't you change your lock

770
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,800
into a combination lock?

771
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,060
Searching for your keys every day.

772
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,570
Right,

773
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,750
mom said

774
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,750
I'll help you find a date

775
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,220
for next week's dinner party.

776
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,370
What type do you like?

777
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,370
Tell me.

778
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,610
No need.

779
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,120
It's our aunt who

780
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,510
will throw the party.

781
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,890
Our parents said we have to go.

782
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
I can't pretend to be you anymore.

783
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,760
OK.

784
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,680
How many times

785
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,230
have I attended important social meetings

786
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,620
for you?

787
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,840
Now,

788
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,140
they all say

789
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,970
the elder son of the Ouyang family

790
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,550
is erudite and polite.

791
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,840
Rather, the younger one

792
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,680
is more naughty and rebellious.

793
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,900
And he never shows up.

794
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,330
I've been wronged.

795
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,270
Briefly being me

796
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,290
and accepting other people's recognition and praise

797
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,030
is a cool thing for you, right?

798
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,310
You've never said

799
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:26,860
so many words before

800
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,950
except reciting texts as a child.

801
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,560
Wait.

802
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,450
Who wants to be you anyway.

803
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,640
Drive.

804
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,650
Stop laughing.

805
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,870
I have a date.

806
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,720
That hurts.

807
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,690
Ouch.

808
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,830
Be gentle with me.

809
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,260
Be gentle with me.

810
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,650
Stop overreacting.

811
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,990
That hurts.

812
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,620
Well.

813
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,230
In the middle of the day,

814
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,240
you guys don't close the door?

815
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,210
Be gentle with me.

816
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:11,920
Never mind.

817
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,850
What if...

818
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,480
Ouch.

819
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,110
I'm...

820
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,790
Be gentle with me.

821
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
I should help others.

822
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,270
Help them.

823
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,670
What are you doing?

824
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,270
I just passed by.

825
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,700
I see that you left the door open.

826
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,000
You are so fast...

827
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,860
I mean,

828
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,360
are you going to

829
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,180
eat out?

830
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,610
Why are you still here?

831
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,880
I'm waiting for you.

832
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,430
Waiting for me?

833
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,310
Yes.

834
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,010
Miss Li,

835
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,390
are your feet OK?

836
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,490
OK, I guess.

837
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,880
I don't know.

838
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,020
I just turned around

839
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,450
and sprained my ankle.

840
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,470
Luckily, Hang helped me to apply some medicine.

841
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,850
Otherwise,

842
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,360
I wouldn't be able to work tomorrow.

843
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,340
I'm ready to order.

844
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:04,970
Come.

845
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,140
You can choose

846
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,190
dishes you like.

847
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,790
I'm losing weight.

848
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,010
I don't really eat for dinner.

849
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,180
You guys can order.

850
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,780
Then why are you here?

851
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,670
Shouldn't you be at the hotel taking a nap?

852
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,640
I'm here because of you, of course.

853
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm ready to order.

854
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,270
OK.

855
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,570
Waiter,

856
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,370
hello,

857
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,650
I want barbecued pork in honey sauce.

858
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,960
A classic roast goose.

859
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,340
And sea urchins.

860
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,190
Right, sea urchins.

861
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,110
And also,

862
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,090
foie gras and beef with rice.

863
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,180
Right.

864
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,690
That's all.

865
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,990
OK.

866
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,090
That's all.

867
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,840
Thank you.

868
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,730
OK, please wait for a while.

869
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,390
I didn't expect

870
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,660
my taste to be so similar to yours.

871
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,340
Are you

872
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,010
planning to have dinner

873
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,570
at a MICHELIN-starred restaurant?

874
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,620
Because of high-intensity meetings

875
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,630
tomorrow and after that,

876
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,140
we think it's better just to lower our standard

877
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,610
and have some rest as early as possible.

878
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,170
It's a pity that

879
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,060
we don't eat at that restaurant.

880
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,130
Do you have any plans for the next few days?

881
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,860
You could stay in Shenzhen for a few more days.

882
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,290
I'll be with you more often then.

883
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,139
And after that, let's go shopping in Hong Kong.

884
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,790
Didn't your mother

885
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,590
want to open a SP Marketplace in Hong Kong?

886
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,280
After the meetings,

887
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,370
we have to go back.

888
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,429
It will be a tight schedule.

889
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,330
It kinda scares me.

890
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,219
It looks like it's going to rain.

891
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,179
What is it?

892
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,110
Do you like him or what?

893
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,199
Who?

894
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,050
Stop acting.

895
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,020
You know who I'm talking about.

896
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,080
I have a boyfriend.

897
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,590
So what?

898
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,440
I don't think your boyfriend

899
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,080
is better than Lanhang.

900
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,720
Miss Li,

901
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,610
Lanhang is indeed

902
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,740
quite nice.

903
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,090
But not everyone thinks

904
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:16,930
he is the best

905
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,520
as you do.

906
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,570
I know he treats you differently.

907
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,500
But you are such

908
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,920
a normal girl!

909
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,560
Did you play some tricks?

910
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,330
How could he have feelings for you?

911
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,350
Miss Li,

912
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,240
put my feelings for him

913
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,460
and his feelings for me aside.

914
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,940
Why do you think

915
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,900
a normal girl like me

916
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,410
has to play some tricks to

917
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,930
make him like me?

918
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,510
Yes.

919
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,490
Maybe you don't think I'm quite good.

920
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,080
But from my perspective,

921
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,220
I'm the best.

922
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,720
Really.

923
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,650
Unique.

924
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,400
Beautiful.

925
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,830
Worthy of being loved.

926
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,950
If you insist on

927
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,120
not letting me go,

928
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,100
I will shout "Yang Lanhang" here.

929
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,390
You can also take this opportunity

930
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,530
to show him your feelings.

931
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,700
You.

932
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,150
Yang Lan...

933
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,410
Go then.

934
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,530
Hello.

935
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,040
Hello, Panpan.

936
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,630
Your tuxedo is here.

937
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,860
You can come to my house tomorrow to try it on.

938
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,750
But I have a meeting at 9:30.

939
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,820
Breakfast time?

940
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,870
OK.

941
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,390
7:30 then.

942
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,600
OK.

943
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,980
See you tomorrow.

944
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,800
Panpan.

945
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,610
You are finally here.

946
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,850
Tomorrow's meeting is quite early.

947
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,820
You have to get an early rest.

948
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,710
You can go back and have some rest, too.

949
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,560
OK.

950
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,240
Good night.

951
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,290
Good night.

952
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,100
Lingling.

953
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,340
What is it?

954
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,440
Come here for a minute.

955
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,130
Are we getting an early rest?

956
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,260
Get prepared for the outline

957
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,500
for tomorrow's meetings.

958
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,830
OK.

959
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,090
Read this outline.

960
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,230
It will be easier to understand

961
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,400
when listening to the presentation tomorrow.

962
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,160
Read this here.

963
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,090
You can ask me

964
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,140
if you don't understand anything.

965
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,620
It's just that

966
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,350
there are too many unfamiliar words for me.

967
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,190
I'm having trouble reading this.

968
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,170
I have to get my laptop.

969
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,280
Give me that.

970
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:18,790
See.

971
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,850
All of the technical terms

972
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,990
were annotated.

973
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,760
Just read.

974
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,430
No use pretending to have a stomachache.

975
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,190
You have to finish it tonight.

976
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,460
Lingling.

977
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,530
Lingling, are you all right?

978
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,070
Come, I'll take you to the hospital.

979
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,210
Come.

980
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,380
Get some rest first.

981
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,600
I'll call an ambulance for you.

982
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,370
Don't do that.

983
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,300
I'm OK.

984
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,430
-OK.
-Take me upstairs.

985
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,890
I won't call an ambulance.

986
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,770
Don't call an ambulance.

987
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,400
Have some rest first.

988
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:03,870
Sir,

989
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,540
may I help you?

990
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,420
Could you please call a cab for me?

991
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,340
I'm going to the nearest hospital.

992
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,020
OK, one moment.

993
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,550
Be quick please.

994
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,590
Take me upstairs.

995
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,060
I'll be fine after a good night's sleep.

996
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,890
[Waiting to take the order No one is taking the order at the moment]

997
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,330
Sorry sir.

998
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,120
The rain is too heavy.

999
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,050
No cabs are available.

1000
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,600
What about ambulances?

1001
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,690
No cabs available?

1002
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,280
Yes.

1003
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,580
That's OK, just leave me alone.

1004
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,050
I'll figure it out by myself.

1005
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,800
We are deeply sorry.

1006
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,290
Sorry.

1007
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:38,770
That's OK.

1008
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,220
Hello.

1009
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,390
I have a patient here.

1010
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:26,980
Can you help us

1011
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,030
get to the hospital?

1012
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:02,810
Mr. Yang,

1013
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,730
the result is here.

1014
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,950
The heart is fine.

1015
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,170
But do be careful in the future.

1016
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,270
Don't ever get wet again.

1017
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,110
Take some rest.

1018
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,830
Thank you.

1019
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,660
What get wet?

1020
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,500
The doctor said,

1021
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,740
call an ambulance

1022
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,210
if this happens again next time.

1023
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,720
Don't get wet.

1024
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,950
I don't need an ambulance.

1025
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,480
The ambulance

1026
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,400
took mom away.

1027
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,680
I don't like ambulances.

1028
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,530
Don't be afraid.

1029
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,390
I'm here.

1030

1031

♫ In your beautiful dream ♫

1051
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,830
♫ Days with your favor ♫

1052
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,510
♫ And nights eager for your hug ♫

1053
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,960
♫ You treasure me so well ♫

1054
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,680
♫ That I don't need to strive to be strong ♫

1055
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,870
♫ We can share time ♫

1056
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,880
♫ And moonlight as well ♫
