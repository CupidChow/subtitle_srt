Enough about that.

Doesn't matter now.

Great.

OK.

Just be clear.

your persona

No.

It's okay.

I'm quite magnanimous.

00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,700
Well,

711

Are you treating me dinner?

712
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,700
OK.

713

What? What did you say?

727
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,540

745

750
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,740
Actually I will.

751

You are not.

At least not now.

760

762

Hold on.

767
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,739

How much have you drunk?

773
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,060
You are vomiting like this!

774
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,860
It's okay. I'm okay.

775
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,100
I didn't drink much.

776

I'm not drunk.

I need to ask you.

780
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,500
Why is everybody

781
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,220
negative about

782
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,330

Actually, I'm negative about it, too.

788
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,100
Do you know when it rained that day,

789
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,450
I told him I had my umbrella

790
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,860
when I didn't,

791
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,340
because I was afraid that

792
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,340
he wouldn't care

793
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,780
and wouldn't ask me?

794
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,580
So, I thought

795
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,740
maybe I should avoid

796
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
leaving the chance to him.

797
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,780
I just didn't tell him.

798
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,820
Do you think I am

799
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,460

800

801

803
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,940
listen to his voice,

804
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,140
or confess my love.

805
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,060
I fear that

806
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,020

808
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,580
is just a dream.

809
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,580
I'm really afraid that

810

when we face the reality,

00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,240
Let's have a date.

883
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,340
Confession...

884
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,220
What?

885
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,860
He said he liked me!

886
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,220
Who likes you?

887
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,140
Are there any others?

888
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,980
Forever is for Ever!

889
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,020
He said he liked me

890
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,700
and asked me to have a date.

891
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,500
Really?

892
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,300
Look.

893
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,260
It's true.

894
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,740
What would you like to reply?

895
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,650
I don't know,

896
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,380
so I came to you.

897
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,420
What step should I take

898
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,860
in this case?

899
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,420
Step in this case?

900
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,020
Just...

901
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,340
kiss him!

902
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,300
I would like to kiss him.

903
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,020
But,

904
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,220
it's not realistic.

905
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Give me an easy one.

906
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,220
I don't have easy ones.

907
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,700
I only have sophisticated ones.

908
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,610
OK, I will go to sleep.

909
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,860
Congrats. Congrats.

910
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,620
Why didn't you get changed?

911
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,500
Didn't you come back last night?

912
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,010
I also like you.

913
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,560
[Forever is for Ever]

914
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,520
Look outside of your window.

915
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,900
What?

916
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,870
Shut the door. Shut the door.

917
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,890
♫ Monday ♫

918

[He has early told me that.]

938
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,190
Actually...

939
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,320
I'm Forever is for Ever.
