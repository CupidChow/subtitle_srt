00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,780
Here.

179
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,780
This...

180
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,360
This...

181
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,660
What's this?

182
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,330
Let's have a meal together.

183
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,460
Have a meal?

184
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,510
Yes.

185
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,360
Eating is what people do when they are on a date, right?

186
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,190
Date?

187
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,510
You like me and also confessed to me.

188
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,050
So we are

189
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,890
together now.

190
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,780
We are together, so we can have a date.

191
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,790
Lanhang. My fault.

192
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,890
Don't be nervous.

193
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,570
I... I'm nervous too.

194
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,040
No, no, no. Lanhang.

195
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,600
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

196
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,740
I was joking.

197
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,630
Joking?

198
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,270
Yes.

199
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,230
I was really joking.

200
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,490
I just wanted to say it

201
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,880
to disgust you.

202
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,200
You... you wanted to disgust me by saying you like me?

203
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,040
Why did you think

204
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,590
this would disgust me?

205
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
I... I don't believe it.

206
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,520
Yeah, you're right.

207
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,160
But I really wanted to disgust you.

208
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,970
Why...

209
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,940
Why did you

210
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,370
want to disgust me?

211
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,260
Have I done something wrong?

212
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,380
Otherwise, why did you do this to me?

213
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,960
It's OK if you don't want to tell me.

214
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,500
Let me invite you to a meal

215
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,010
as an apology.

216
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,740
Today? Today is not OK.

217
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,540
I decided to

218
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,150
visit my grandmother.

219
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,710
Maybe some other day? OK?

220
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:36,810
Visiting your grandmother?

221
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,090
OK then.

222
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,860
Bye.

223
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,780
Let me help you.

224
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,550
Get on.

225
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,130
Liar.

226
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,290
No.

227
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,300
Maybe they made an appointment

228
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,080
to visit her grandmother

229
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,530
together today.

230
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,190
Next time, it's my turn.

231
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,940
Having a meal together?

232
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:07,990
OK.

233
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,200
I don't like her.

234
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,050
It doesn't matter.

235
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,190
I like her.

236
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,790
Minghao.

237
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,190
Minghao.

238
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,290
You can just stop

239
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,350
at the bus station.

240
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,910
I thought we were going to visit your grandmother,

241
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,340
So I bought some fruit.

242
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,240
Well, OK.

243
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,630
I want to watch the ending

244
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,050
of the TV series,

245
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,270
and I won't watch other parts.

246
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,240
OK? Please!

247
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,370
If you want to watch TV series.

248
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,590
Why don't you

249
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,190
buy a cellphone

250
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,910
rather than borrow other's?

251
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,630
I have a phone.

252
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,650
My granddaughter bought me an easy-to-use phone

253
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,370
because of my eye issues.

254
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,170
The characters are big and convenient.

255
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,020
I can read the characters on the screen without glasses.

256
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,680
Huh.

257
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,810
I guess it's cheap.

258
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,110
A phone is

259
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,790
mainly for making calls.

260
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,560
Just say it straight

261
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,860
if you don't want to lend it to me.

262
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,940
I can even guess

263
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,550
the ending of such kind of

264
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,610
TV series.

265
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,440
I don't feel like watching it.

266
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,110
Grandmother.

267
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,800
Wu Chunhua. Wu Chunhua.

268
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,430
So annoying!

269
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,010
She refused to let me watch it.

270
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,100
That old woman

271
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,020
wouldn't let me watch the TV series.

272
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,990
Alright. Having a fight again.

273
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,260
Young fellow.

274
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,400
Grandmother.

275
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,120
Who is he?

276
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,290
You don't have to keep your voice down.

277
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,220
This is my schoolmate at the university,

278
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:38,930
Zheng Minghao.

279
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,740
He said he could

280
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,670
drop by with me.

281
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,150
Welcome. Welcome.

282
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,410
I was unprepared and I don't know

283
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,710
what you like,

284
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,840
so I bought some fruit.

285
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,310
Do you like it?

286
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,740
Yes.

287
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,930
I like whatever

288
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,350
brought by Lingling's boyfriend.

289
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,360
Come here, sit down.

290
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,240
Sit down please, grandmother.

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,850
It looks beautiful!

292
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,800
Nice.

293
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,220
Mrs. Zhang.

294
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,900
You're here.

295
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,870
Mrs. Zhang.

296
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,140
Have a try.

297
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,410
It's OK. You... You...

298
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,420
OK.

299
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,030
Do you want an apple?

300
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,460
I'll peel it for you.

301
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,250
No.

302
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,980
I have a toothache.

303
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,830
Why do you suddenly get a toothache?

304
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,750
Why?

305
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,310
I'm too old with only a few teeth.

306
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,570
I want to remove them all.

307
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,180
Minghao,

308
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,390
you sit here chatting with my grandmother.

309
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,700
I'm going to the restroom.

310
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,620
OK.

311
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,830
I'll bring you a coat.

312
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,110
What do you want to eat?

313
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,860
I'll peel it.

314
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,800
How old are you?

315
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,310
You know

316
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,490
your grandmother's situation.

317
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,510
She has been planted with mechanical heart valve prostheses

318
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,160
in a hospital in your hometown.

319
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,680
Although her heart function

320
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,510
seems to be fine currently,

321
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,480
she needs to take

322
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,280
anticoagulant drugs

323
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,260
throughout her life

324
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,180
after being planted with such

325
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,569
heart valve prostheses.

326
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,920
If she removes her teeth,

327
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,770
she will face the risk of being infected.

328
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,829
You'd better go to the hospital.

329
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,359
This is my fault.

330
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,359
She didn't tell me

331
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,680
when she did that operation

332
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,430
because she didn't

333
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,730
want me to be worried.

334
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,290
Then she got sick,

335
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,000
and that's when

336
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,050
I realized it.

337
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,970
Theoretically, anticoagulant drugs

338
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,490
have certain side effects on the human body.

339
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,300
But don't worry.

340
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,270
It's nothing serious.

341
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,410
Doctor Liao, I want to know

342
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,080
if her mechanical heart valve prostheses

343
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,910
can be replaced with bio prosthetic heart valves.

344
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

345
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,060
But she needs open-heart surgery

346
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,270
to remove the original

347
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,720
heart valves.

348
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,470
Your grandmother is old,

349
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,010
but her physical indexes

350
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,700
are basically normal.

351
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,250
So I don't think it's necessary.

voted as an intangible cultural heritage of Huaihai University.

What happened between you and Bai Lingling?

Although you don't talk too much,

you look

Do you remember when we were kids?

We messed things up

and we knew nothing.

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,290

Although it appears that

I'm OK with doing the chores in the lab,

it's beneath my ability.

I found an excuse for myself

469
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,060
when my paper was printed wrong,

470
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,900
I thought my internship work made me too tired to be careful.

when my lab interview failed.

473
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,310
I thought he spited me.

474
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,870
I've never thought that

475
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,720
all of these setbacks were caused by myself.

476
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,850
So each time when Yang Lanhang

477
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,820
asked me to work overtime or

478
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,160
assigned me lots of work

479
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,710
and told me something about his working experience,

480
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,390
I was always very impatient.

481
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,280
I thought he was fond of being a teacher.

482
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,220

'I'm just doing the chores,

should I be that serious?'

I thought either.

Did he say something bad about me?

Don't say it like that.

499

The girl sent you so many messages

508

because she wants you to comfort her

509
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,600
rather than

510
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,620
affirm her words

511
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,340
and tell her 'You are right,

512
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,200
you are incapable

513
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,760
and you should recognize yourself correctly'!

Aren't you a straight man?

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,180
Of course I am,

but not your type.

699

To be honest,

700
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,500
seldom have I met a girl with

701
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,679

He's always

707
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,230
been in the pub,

708
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,199

709

There's nothing special.

710
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,510
But what did he mean

711
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,350
by that last remark?

712
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,400
I suppose he's trying to get back at you!

713
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,040
No way! It is now a society ruled by law.

714
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,260
What can he do to me?

715
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,190
Wait. Now that I think about it.

716
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,449
This person is thick-skinned enough.

717

718
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,650

719
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,120

720
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,630
