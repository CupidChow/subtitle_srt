Sorry, the number you have dialed is powered off.

He hasn't answered it yet.

Geng Panpan is missing.

148
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,850
Missing?

149
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,170
Our dorm lost

150
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,720
four laptops

151
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,690
and two phones yesterday,

152
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,110
including his.

153
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,410
He wasn't back then.

154
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,110
We were not able to contact him either.

155
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,690
And we were about to call the police.

156
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,460
Suddenly,

157
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,430
the alarm set on my phone rang.

158
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,770
So, we found

159
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,330
his suitcase following the sound.

160
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,420
As a result, everything is in there.

161
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,980
Is, is there any

162
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,780
misunderstanding within this?

163
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,110
Maybe he was

164
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,160
just joking with you guys.

165
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,350
I thought so

166
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,280
at the beginning,

167
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,790
thinking it was his prank.

168
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,640
However,

169
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,810
we asked him

170
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,690
when he came back.

171
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,950
And he admitted his deed.

172
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,470
We got to know that

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,880
the money he bought the bouquet and gift

174
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,330
for you

175
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,840
was partly from his tuition fee.

176
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,110
And the rest was borrowed from others.

177
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,290
The school urged him to pay the tuition fee.

178
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,260
He couldn't find a way to solve the problem,

179
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,690
so he did this finally.

180
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,150
He's been away for so long.

181
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,040
Is he okay?

182
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,420
Does school know that?

183
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,770
Not yet.

184
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,950
But

185
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,380
he will definitely be expelled from school in this condition.

186
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,680
Expelled?

187
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,650
We don't want to do this to him.

188
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,250
But everyone was

189
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
a bit awkward yesterday.

190
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,410
I didn't sleep until dawn.

191
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,720
But when I opened my eyes,

192
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,020
he was missing.

193
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm really afraid something would happen to him.

194
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,340
and he would do something silly.

195
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,770
I understand.

196
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,700
Well,

197
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,750
please help me explain the situation

198
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,720
with your friends.

199
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,940
I will find him.

200
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,820
OK. OK.

Don't go.

339
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,820
Give the eyebrow pencil back.

340

Wear this.

It is also

347
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,560
the first luxury in my life.

348
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,550
I have named it

349
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,340
"Mini Watermelon".

350
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,060
"Mini Watermelon"?

351
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,310
And this.

352
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,940
I bought this

353
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,450
with my first

354
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,080
contribution fee.

355
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,760
I gave myself a reward with it.

356
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,260
It is Black Chocolate,

357
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,270
nick-named Choco.

358
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,710
This is

359
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
called Little Star.

360
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,730
I really like it.

361
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,450
Look at it.

362
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,460
Isn't it shining?

363
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,510
Isn't it gorgeous?

364
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,370
No.

365
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,490
What are you doing?

366
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,100
I just calculated

367
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,990
the money Panpan owed

368
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,590
in general.

369
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,180
Besides tuition fees,

370
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,750
it's about 50 to 60 thousand.

371
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,270
I just

372
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700
spend as much as I earn

373
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,010
and don't have any savings.

374
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,410
Only these are kind of valuable.

375
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,950
I can only sell them with pain

376
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,020
and use money for emergencies.

377
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,750
It's he owing money. Why is it relevant to you?

378
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,620
That's his problem.

379
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,220
As the saying goes, I'm not a murderer,

380
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,920
but someone was killed because of me.

381
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,580
And

382
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,890
the money he owns

383
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,570
is mostly because of me.

384
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,210
He helped me when

385
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,840
I really needed it.

386
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,520
So, he is my friend.

387
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,460
I must save him.

388
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,810
Alright.

389
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,700
I have a friend

390
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,660
who sells second-hand

391
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,380
luxuries.

392
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
You can put your bags

393
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,400
in my car.

394
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,120
I can send them to him for evaluation.

395
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,980
I will tell you after that.

396
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,440
Is it reliable?

397
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,620
Of course.

398
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,670
Think about it.

399
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,720
If you send the bags

400
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,770
to other stores

401
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,820
for evaluation.

402
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,450
You need at least a few days.

403
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,670
This is my man.

404
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,640
I can rush it.

405
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,230
If everything is all right,

406
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,200
he can transfer money to you tonight.

407
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,250
Tonight.

408
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,810
OK.

409
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,830
Thanks.

410
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,390
I'm not used to

411
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,860
your sudden politeness.

412
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,180
Well.

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,600
The problem of money is settled for now.

414
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,370
What about the person?

415
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,560
Didn't you say that

416
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,670
there's a way to find him?

417
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,550
Tell me.

418
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,470
Do you remember Mr. Chen

419
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,820
we met this morning?

420
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,910
Have any impressions?

421
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,130
He is my father's assistant.

422
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,150
He is a know-it-all.

423
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,510
Please find someone for me.

424
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,920
Which are the social apps

425
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,760
he uses frequently?

426
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,470
Give me his accounts.

427
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,080
I'll try to find them out.

428
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,630
He uses Weibo, Zhihu and Douban

429
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,390
at normal times.

430
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,780
His user ID is

431
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,910
"Mr. Panda".

432
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,640
You may rest assured.

433
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,530
He is very terrific.

434
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,950
Then how do you think

435
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,420
I found Zhao Lei?

436
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,020
It's not like what you think!

437
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,450
That's the only time I checked.

438
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,760
After all,

439
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,770
I haven't fallen in love

440
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,240
with anybody because of you.

441
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,960
I'm sorry about that.

442
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,040
Got it.

443
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,390
There have been no new updates

444
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,860
on his accounts

445
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,500
on these platforms for more than

446
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,590
ten hours since last night.

447
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,980
But I found an account through

448
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,110
the linking function of Weibo.

449
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,460
It could be his alt account.

450
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,250
He tweeted at about 2:00 this afternoon.

451
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,090
Look.

452
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,100
[I don't regret loving you. 
Being with you is the best thing I've ever had.]

453
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,040
He is really a wimpy kid.

454
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,970
It was him who did something wrong,

455
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,430
but he acted as if he was wronged.

456
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,110
Excuse me.

457
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,420
Could you please find his complete address?

458
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,020
Are you still angry?

459
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,130
How could I let it go?

460
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,180
The academic conference hasn't started yet,

461
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,190
but he had already slept in the

462
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,750
same room with that girl!

463
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,500
What,

464
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,060
if this gets out, I...

465
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,740
That'd be a pure shame for me.

466
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,040
Let alone him!

467
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,260
That's no big deal.

468
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,780
It's a positive thing that

469
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,460
male and female students

470
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,720
fall in love with each other and make progress together.

471
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,700
Yes.

472
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,830
Besides,

473
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,340
that girl is a new

474
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,150
graduate student of mine.

475
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,120
She is a nice person.

476
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,450
No.

477
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,220
I'm not trying to interfere with

478
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,730
their private love issues,

479
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,400
right?

480
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,580
I just hope that

481
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,430
they can treasure their own reputations.

482
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,830
Look at our researchers.

483
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,880
There are so many of them who have made achievements

484
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,820
but finally lost their future

485
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,580
just because their personal

486
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,300
lives were exposed and spread

487
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,980
without reason by network media.

488
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,200
You will definitely lose your future

489
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,670
if the media hype your gossip.

490
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,150
Yang,

491
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,950
to tell the truth.

492
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,510
Lanhang is

493
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,510
really promising.

494
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,110
The premise of treasuring his reputation

495
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,660
is that he has a good one.

496
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,810
Look at Minghao,

497
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,280
I don't want to see him at all.

498
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,870
Isn't he in Shenzhen right now?

499
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,840
Why didn't you invite him

500
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,220
over for dinner?

501
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,150
I did. I did.

502
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,910
He is on the way.

503
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,050
All right.

504
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:11,970
By the way,

505
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,310
Yang.

506
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,870
I also invited Lingling.

507
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,380
Who is Lingling?

508
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,310
My student,

509
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,360
the girl who slept with

510
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,370
your son.

511
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:20,790
What!

512
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,810
You... Watch your mouth!

513
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,400
What 'slept with'!

514
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,070
OK, OK.

515
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,040
They didn't.

516
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,170
Didn't.

517
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,270
I'll ask them

518
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,370
where they are.

519
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,400
You are here.

520
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,870
Dad. Professor.

521
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,720
Headmaster Li. Headmaster Zheng.

522
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,820
Professor Yang. Professor Jiang.

523
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,990
Headmaster Li. Headmaster Zheng.

524
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,620
Well.

Li,

538
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,810
I remember that your daughter

539
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,900
will graduate soon.

540
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,580
Next July.

541
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,560
What's her plan?

542
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,450
She told me that

543
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,720
she wants to go to Canada for her master's degree.

544
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,820
I think it's also a good choice

545
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,840
to continue her studies in a domestic university.

546
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,930
It'll cost too much

547
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,530
if she goes abroad.

548
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,700
You're right.

549
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,260
Now I found that

550
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,230
the postgraduate education

551
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,620
in China is no worse than abroad.

552
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,170
Absolutely right.

553
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,190
When we were studying for our master's degree,

554
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,910

555

556

But now,

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,690

562
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,290

00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,830
I won't give up!

700
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,070
Sir,

701
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,800
please send me to Marriott Hotel.

702
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,820
Didn't you tell me that you have a way to find him?

703
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,210
Why haven't we found him

704
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,590
after searching for a whole day?

705
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,179
I didn't expect

706
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,480
your fake boyfriend to hide so secretly.

707
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,489
OK, OK.

708
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,489
That's all my fault.

709
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,800
My fault, okay?

710
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,850
But, there is one more thing.

711
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,490
My friend of a thrift store

712
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,330
gave me a reply.

713
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,760
He had authenticated your bags

714
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,890
and fixed their prices.

715
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,150
He will send you money

716
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,200
if you agree.

717
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,440
[Name  watermelon red handbag  black handbag  
fully-jewelled mini handbag  luxury handbag  limited messenger bag  
imported shoulder bag  Price]

718
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,690
Sure.

719
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,080
Your friend is dependable.

720
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,140
He gave me relatively high prices.

721
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,110
Give me your account.

722
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,670
I'll tell him to send you money.

723
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,390
Thank you very much for that.

724
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,990
Tomorrow,

725
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,510
I'll go to solve the problem of money.

726
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,870
Once the money problem is solved,

727
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,520
Panpan might show up voluntarily.

728
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,910
You're right.

729
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,640
Money is the biggest problem.

730
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,900
He will show up sooner or later

731
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,490
as long as we've solved

732
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,130
the money problem.

733
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,530
But have you thought about

734
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,750
what would you do

735
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,090
after you find him?

736
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,750
I don't know.

737
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,760
I don't know whether we can

738
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,730
still be good friends

739
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,050
after we meet again.

740
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,080
What about you?

741
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,050
What would you do

742
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,390
if you were me?

743
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,850
I think you should figure out

744
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,590
why you made friends

745
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,680
with him.

746
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,550
Why?

747
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,780
I don't know either.

748
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,910
I just think that I feel

749
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,430
relaxed when I get along with him.

750
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,040
He would try

751
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,470
all his efforts

752
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,390
and 200 percent passion

753
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,370
to do whatever

754
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,960
ridiculous things

755
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm trying to do.

756
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,210
You know what?

757
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,690
I think I'm really

758
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,080
good at dating.

759
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,900
As long as I like someone,

760
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,240
I can make clear in ten minutes

761
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,630
what kind of girl

762
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,350
he likes.

763
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,400
Then

764
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,370
I'll change into that kind of girl

765
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,180
and appear in front of them.

766
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,490
But I don't need to do that

767
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,800
in front of Panpan.

768
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,790
I can just be myself.

769
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,860
So,

770
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,180
after he confessed to me,

771
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,070
I didn't refuse him right away.

772
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,730
Because I thought

773
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,330
I might have a little

774
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,760
feeling of fluke

775
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,340
that I could fall in

776
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,070
love with him one day.

777
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,160
You won't.

778
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,190
People will feel entangled

779
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,410
when facing the person they like.

780
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,790
It'd be hard to relax.

781
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,070
Impossible. I hate you so much,

782
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,950
but why am I so nervous

783
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,380
in front of you?

784
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,120
But one thing seems right.

785
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,540
Maybe I just don't

786
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,410
like him that much.

787
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,430
No.

788
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,410
Maybe I,

789
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,770
I haven't fallen in love with him.

790
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,430
Not really.

791
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,780
I actually kind of like him.

792
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,620
You know?

793
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,790
I've been thinking about it all day.

794
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,410
I was wondering why he

795
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,750
changed into such a person.

796
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,270
Why can't he just be himself?

797
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,330
If we, if I,

798
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,050
if I refused him earlier,

799
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,270
could we still

800
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,820
be good friends?

801
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,770
No way.

802
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,740
He'll never

803
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,210
become good friends with me.

804
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,160
He likes me,

805
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,070
so we'll never be good friends.

806
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,880
You drank too much.

807
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,810
Listen.

808
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,280
Don't press me to go home.

809
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,640
I won't go home.

810
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,660
But I want to say thank you

811
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,170
for your company today.

812
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,060
I really don't know

813
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,240
what I would do

814
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,840
today without you.

815
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,770
Lingling is also not here.

816
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,060
You have no need to thank me.

817
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,640
You don't even know

818
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,530
how regretful I am

819
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,830
after searching with you all day.

820
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,020
I haven't written my

821
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,850
product marketing plan yet.

822
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,220
I have to stay up late tonight.

823
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,990
I, Ouyang Yifan,

824
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:24,820
can only stay up late for disco dancing.

825
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,310
I have never stayed up late for work!

826
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,600
I won't poke my nose into other people's business anymore.

827
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,750
What about this?

828
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,360
I'll write it for you.

829
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,520
I am good at writing plans.

830
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:34,710
You?

831
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,350
You're drunk.

832
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,860
Go home quickly.

833
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,710
Go to sleep.

834
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,720
I won't go home.

835
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,370
But you are also

836
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,680
a strange person.

837
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,000
Do you know

838
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,440
what people say about you?

839
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,070
They said you are a playboy

840
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
and easy to fall in love with girls.

841
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,850
You change your girlfriend

842
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,320
as quickly as change clothes.

843
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,050
But why can you be good to me

844
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,360
for such a long time?

845
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,130
Are you nostalgic?

846
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,500
Do I look like a nostalgic person?

847
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,070
I'm not missing the old things,

848
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,100
but the person.

849
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:19,190
♫ We have a blank space between us ♫

850
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,460
♫ Parted by only one wall ♫

851
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,860
♫ Neither of us wanted to climb over ♫

852
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,720
♫ I stand on the terrace of your shadow ♫

853
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,540
♫ Wind blew and sea rippled ♫

854
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,310
♫ Everything was ♫

855
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:47,260
♫ Exactly covered by memories ♫

856
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,260
Bai Lingling,

857
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,460
Lanhang?

858
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,850
What's the matter?

859
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,660
I guess you didn't eat enough,

860
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,260
so I brought you some food.

861
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,560
How do you know that?

862
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,120
I'm just going to order a takeout.

863
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,250
Thank you.

864
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,560
I thought you would

865
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,650
come back late.

866
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,090
Well,

867
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,920
they are still having dinner.

868
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,050
I came back first.

869
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,670
Then, I'll go back to my room.

870
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,390
Thank you.

871
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:22,990
By the way,

872
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,160
how did you reply to his question?

873
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,530
Which question?

874
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,430
Who?

875
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,320
Zheng Minghao's question.

876
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,510
Which one would you choose

877
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,910
if there were only

878
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,810
two men left on earth?

879
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,330
[Yang Lanhang had taken great pains.]

880
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,500
Professor,

881
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,620
I want to take Bai Lingling

882
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,570
with us to the conference in Shenzhen.

883
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,370
She won't take the place of our lab.

884
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,470
I'll pay for all the expenses.

885
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:05,820
Don't look at me like that.

886
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,120
I have no other thoughts.

887
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,830
That's all because

888
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,330
she put forward the technology

889
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,000
of 3D printing to grow cells.

890
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,460
I think it's valuable.

891
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,120
Sure.

892
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,410
Please don't tell her that

893
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,330
I'll pay for the expenses.

894
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,380
And also,

895
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,350
this is her salary this month.

896
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,210
Please transfer it to her.

897
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,770
I

898
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,330
have already submitted the application.

899
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,260
She has been a regular employee

900
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,030
of our lab

901
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,030
since this month.

902
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,090
Her salary

903
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,770
will also be paid by the lab.

904
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,730
Really?

905
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,950
That's great.

906
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,300
Professor,

907
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,320
I still want you to give her this.

908
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,880
Just tell her she performs well

909
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,290
and this is her pay increase.
