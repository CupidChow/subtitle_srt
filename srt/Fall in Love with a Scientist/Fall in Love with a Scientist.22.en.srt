4
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,580
Are you okay, Xiaoxiao?

5
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,660
Xiaoxiao?

6
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,060
I'm okay. I'm okay.

7
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,100
Such a trifle can't scare me at all.

8
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,420
I'm really fine.

9
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,130
What is it?

10
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,740
What is it?

11
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,539
You'd better not see it.

12
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,100
Throw it away.

13
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,579
What is it?

14
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,690
Nothing.

15
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,140
Have you checked the monitor?

16
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,180
I couldn't see anything.

17
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,340
We have voice-activated lights in this building.

18
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,140
And the man came in in the dark.

19
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,020
I can only check with property management

20
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,860
to see if there's any surveillance

21
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,100
inside the elevator.

22
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm sorry, Xiaoxiao.

23
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,380
That's all because of me.

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,420
I got you involved.

25
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Don't say sorry to me!

26
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,700
Pretentious!

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,579
Listen.

28
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,780
I was careless this time.

29
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,540
I'll teach him a lesson

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,980
if he dares to come again!

31
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,390
Come on!

32
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,579
You already turned pale.

33
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,500
So stubborn.

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,100
You need to change a place

35
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,340
to live these days.

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,420
What about living

37
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,700
with your parents?

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,460
No way.

39
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,380
I can't leave you

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,220
alone here.

41
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,220
Its' too dangerous.

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,620
Why don't you stay at my home?

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,980
My parents' house is roomy

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,180
and they seldom stay at home.

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,860
It's also very strictly managed.

46
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,940
Ordinary people can't get in there.

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,820
I don't think that's appropriate.

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,300
Why not?

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,780
Hang, see.

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,870
You can't understand

51
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,460
girl's thoughts.

52
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,610
She hasn't even met your parents yet,

53
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,060
but now you invite her to live in your home.

54
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:16,860
In what identity?

55
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,380
She will see my parents sooner or later.

56
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,460
That's still not appropriate!

57
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,700
What about this?

58
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,540
Since Hang feels worried about you,

59
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,460
what about

60
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,100
my moving to this house?

61
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,090
It will be much safer

62
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,100
if there is a man.

63
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,410
Don't tell me that

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,020
it was you who put the scary thing.

65
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,460
How could I do that!

66
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,780
Look at your expression just now,

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,460
just like a villain

68
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,620
whose trick had worked.

69
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,940
Which trick did I do?

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,300
You...!

71
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,220
Alright. Alright.

72
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,700
You two stop arguing.

73
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,260
How about your negotiations

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,500
with Wang Shu?

75
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,620
I haven't got a result.

76
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,100
He asserted that

77
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,579
they had voted

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,660
to choose the topic.

79
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,060
It was totally because

80
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,420
this thing went viral on the hot topic list

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,780
and they wanted to ride the wave.

82
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,260
As for the contents,

83
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,140
they were offered by the parties themselves.

84
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,950
They were neither inspired

85
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,140
nor embellished.

86
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,220
They didn't even

87
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,060
know it was such

88
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,700
big news before

89
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,980
and thought that they would make a fortune.

90
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,340
Right.

91
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,740
Contact the Shenliu News as soon as possible.

92
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
All conditions can be met

93
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,580
as long as they are willing to

94
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,459
remove the article.

95
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:19,820
OK.

96
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,459
OK. OK.

97
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,730
I'll contact you later.

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,460
My son?

99
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,860
Why did you come so late?

100
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,610
I want to go back to live for a few days.

101
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,940
Why didn't you tell me

102
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,700
in advance?

103
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,970
I haven't even changeg your bed sheet.

104
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,580
Come in. Give me.

105
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,450
No, thanks, mom.

106
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:34,940
Mom,

107
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,780
who were you calling?

108
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,780
Nobody.

109
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,580
Just a company staff.

110
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,940
You don't know his name.

111
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,980
I heard what you said.

112
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,940
You called him to

113
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,060
remove the article

114
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,050
from Shenliu News, right?

115
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,260
It's because I'm worried about you.

116
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,500
Mom, I know you're worried about me.

117
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,180
But I advise you not to do that.

118
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,659
Why?

119
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,500
This can only make the problem

120
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,540
more complicated.

121
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,740
They would feel that

122
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,770
I performed academic cheating

123
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,500
but was actually supported

124
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,290
by shady capital.

125
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,900
The credibility of research institutions

126
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,460
will be further questioned.

127
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,420
Or even worse,

128
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,580
the social evaluation of SP

129
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
may be adversely affected.

130
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,700
You should consider it

131
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,860
more carefully.

132
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,020
Dear son,

133
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
you've got a point there.

134
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,460
It seems that I'm too impatient.

135
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,620
Well.

136
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,420
I'll call back again.

137
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,380
I won't force them to remove the article.

138
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,900
Take it easy.

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,660
I can deal with

140
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,540
my own business.

141
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,820
Don't worry.

142
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,700
And my bed sheet,

143
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,580
I'll change it by myself.

144
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,659
I'm not a kid anymore.

145
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,860
You should go to bed early.

146
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,060
Good night.

147
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,940
Hang.

148
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,620
Don't flaunt your superiority.

149
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,540
You just do it if you can cover the problem.

150
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,820
But if not,

151
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,940
you still have me with you.

152
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,500
I don't care about the so-called credibility

153
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,980
or social evaluation.

154
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,500
I have struggled with my business for so many years.

155
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,980
And now I think everything

156
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,780
will be meaningless

157
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,610
if I can't protect my son

158
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,540
against malicious slander.

159
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,260
Mom.

160
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,900
Thank you.

161
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,780
You can cast away your company,

162
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,780
工but the rest of the staff

163
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,140
can't lose their jobs.

164
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,420
Don't get your head in the clouds.

165
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,570
Don't worry.

166
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm alright.

167
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,100
OK?

168
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,260
OK.

169
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
Cutie.

170
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,580
Do you want to sleep together?

171
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,900
Alright.

172
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,330
Get, get down.

173
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,460
What are you doing?

174
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,580
It's too early.

175
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,100
You finally got up.

176
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,380
I bought a surveillance camera

00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,640
If he'd like to stay

351
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,080
we'll definitely nominate him ,

352
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,430
for the coming election of

353
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,430
Distinguished Young Scholars.

354
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,780
But we didn't expect that

355
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,160
such a scandal to appear.

356
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,840
We don't want to see him

357
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,440
be ruined like this.

358
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,120
Have a look at this.

359
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,400
This is the last quota of the university

360
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,700
to go abroad on an official assignment.

361
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,960
What you should do is just

362
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,550
go back and sign it.

363
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,190
Headmaster.

364
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,450
For the problem

365
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,590
of academic cheating,

366
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,900
how would you

367
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,820
prove that he is innocent?

368
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,830
You don't need

369
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,170
to worry about that.

370
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,560
All you have to do is

371
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,940
sign up and then

372
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,200
return here

373
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,040
for the formalities.

374
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,060
If it's just like

375
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,190
what you said,

376
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,040
you love Yang Lanhang as your own kid,

377
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,970
then I think the most important thing at this time is that

378
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,360
how to cleanse him of the

379
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,160
stigma of the academic fraud,

380
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,010
instead of trying to

381
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,230
get me out of here.

382
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm not that important.

383
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,050
I feel guilty that

384
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,190
you gave me such a heavy stake.

385
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,070
It's true.

386
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,130
You might as well

387
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,020
ask me to take his place for the academic fraud.

388
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,660
If so,

389
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,380
I might feel a little more peace of mind.

390
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,400
What the hell are you talking about!

391
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,160
Just kidding.

392
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,520
Please don't be serious.

393
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,790
Anyway, I won't go abroad.

394
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm not interested in it.

395
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,130
It's too hot for me

396
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,230
to hold something that doesn't belong to me.

397
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
But I won't give to others

398
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,250
what belongs to me either.

399
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,180
I passed the postgraduate entrance exam

400
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,160
with blood, sweat

401
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,510
and tears.

402
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,270
If you think

403
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,320
there is something

404
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,410
concerning fairness,

405
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,210
it's okay for me

406
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,130
to cooperate with all forms

407
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,150
of investigation.

408
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,630
But no matter what the consequence is,

409
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,810
I won't leave Yang Lanhang anyway.

410
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,450
I like him,

411
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,630
I love him,

412
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,050
so I'll consider for him

413
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,150
and do what he likes.

414
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,570
He

415
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,760
had given up

416
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,690
so much for me

417
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,450
but he had never let me go.

418
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,460
So will I.

419
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,770
Why should I let him go?

420
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,670
OK. I finished my words.

421
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,350
We are quite busy in the lab.

422
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,110
I need to go now.

423
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,760
You...

424
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,130
You know know what happened.

425
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
Assistant Chen is awesome.

426
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,280
He had investigated

427
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,620
Tang Shun thoroughly

428
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,800
about his personal information.

429
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,020
He is not on a trip at all.

430
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,280
He just stays at home.

431
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,220
It's of no use to find him.

432
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,020
He can only tell us a pack of lies.

433
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,450
That's a libel,

434
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,130
and he should be punished by the law.

435
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,470
We might as well think about

436
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,530
how we can get him to tell us the truth.

437
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,859
Aren't you dizzy?

438
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,839
Stop writing.

439
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,060
No.

440
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,569
You know what?

441
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,250
I wrote an article about the touching love story

442
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,180
of Lingling and Yang Lanhang.

443
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,319
The backstage data is pretty good.

444
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,290
It already has nearly 10,000 readers

445
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,300
in the past one hour.

446
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,850
Next,

447
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,120
I should continue to write it.

448
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,670
What's the content?

449
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,180
I wrote a story of

450
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,330
a genius scientist

451
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,670
suffering from a serious illness

452
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,220
and a poor girl

453
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,440
with a clever mind.

454
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,130
After seven years of online love,

455
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,730
they experienced nearly 20 years

456
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,490
of entanglement

457
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,460
and finally broke through

458
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,640
the obstacles of reality

459
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,900
and fell in love with each other.

460
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,030
But what greeted them

461
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,290
was a new heated debate

462
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,520
and a criticism from the world.

463
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,710
Why are you laughing?

464
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,980
Just tell me whether you want to see it?

465
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,370
Don't you feel that it's too dramatic?

466
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,720
Dramatic?

467
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,310
Just tell me. You want to see it or not?

468
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,280
I want. I want.

469
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,370
I can't wait to see it.

470
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,550
If this story

471
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,340
was printed in a magazine

472
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,350
ten years ago,

473
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,530
it will definitely be sold out.

474
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,330
Really?

475
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,300
I said it.

476
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,900
What's it?

477
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,540
Nothing special.

478
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,760
I'll get down and see it.

479
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,110
Who?!

480
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,730
Who are you?

481
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,780
Get out of the way!

482
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,450
Back off!

483
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,210
Back off!

484
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,640
Back off!

485
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,920
Are you okay?

486
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,520
Are you alright?

487
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,270
I'm fine.

488
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,110
Just skin trauma.

489
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,160
How could they beat you

490
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,710
to such an extent!

491
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,180
They are villains!

492
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,940
In broad daylight!

493
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,040
Come here.

494
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,180
Come here.

495
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,370
Do you want to lean on it?

496
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,620
What the hell happened?

497
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,970
Where did they come from?

498
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,230
Don't worry.

499
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,210
The automobile data recorder was recorded.

500
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,380
They won't run away.

501
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,320
This is Hang's car.

502
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,590
I guess they mistook me for

503
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,720
Hang just like you did before.

504
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,170
I didn't do that before!

505
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,530
I just threw trash at you.

506
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,750
I didn't hit you.

507
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,550
And I didn't hit you

508
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,980
to such an extent.

509
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,140
I'm so sad.

510
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,900
I haven't met anything good

511
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,240
after meeting you.

512
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,450
But I think it's worthwhile

513
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,200
to see you crying for me right now.

514
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,380
What are you saying!

515
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
My laptop was left there.

516
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,670
I...?

517
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,160
♫ The rain is falling in your balcony ♫

518
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,460
♫ Like an accident ♫

519
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,360
♫ Or a long-practiced love confession ♫

520
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,840
♫ So much words I wanted to say ♫

521
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,180
♫ But I always behaved insincerely ♫

522
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,120
♫ The silence turned into ♫

523
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,640
♫ A dust of past time ♫

524
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,230
Headmaster Zheng

525
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,280
found you in the daytime.

526
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,080
What did he say?

527
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,060
Nothing important.

528
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,370
Just some professional topics.

529
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,590
Now we have

530
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,390
done repeated tests

531
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,570
in different directions.

532
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,040
When we prove that

533
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,300
there is no problem

534
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,260
with this material,

535
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,140
can we prove your innocence?

536
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,400
That can only prove that

537
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,120
there's nothing wrong

538
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,420
with our materials and our

539
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,090
animal testing procedures.

540
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,980
But now they're saying

541
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,370
we faked the experiments.

542
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
In the past,

543
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,120
you would have said,

544
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,960
'Well, we've been

545
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,260
working for nothing.'

546
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,570
We can't think of it that way!

547
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,960
We do repeated tests

548
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:41,930
to prove the safety

549
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,480
of our materials,

550
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,240
right?

551
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
Making experiments don't like making shows.

552
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,310
Also,

553
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,830
we need to guarantee that

554
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,600
our data is safe forever.

555
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,740
We should have confidence.

556
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,920
Did I look like that?

557
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,760
You did!

558
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,810
Wasn't that a good imitation?

559
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,980
You were just like this!

560
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,870
They are Yang Lanhang

561
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,750
and Bai Lingling.

562
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,920
How ridiculous.

563
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,520
She passed the postgraduate exam because of her boyfriend,

564
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,120
but now she should dare to display it

565
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,000
in public!

566
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,340
She is disgraceful!

567
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,010
I read a lot of people online saying that

568
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,730
we were like a tortoise matching a dog.

569
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,740
Can you tell me

570
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,790
which one would you like

571
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,880
if you must choose one?

572
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,830
Must I choose one?

573
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,480
Tortoise has a long span.

574
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,910
It moves slowly

575
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,210
but has a beautiful shell,

576
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,520
which can also be made into Chinese medicine.

577
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,910
Dog.... Its life span is shorter.

578
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,960
But it's fluffy.

579
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,180
So cute.

580
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,650
It's hard for me

581
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,990
to choose.

582
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,340
Then I'll be a dog.

583
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,810
You want to be a dog?

584
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,490
OK. Then I'll be a tortoise.

585
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,280
Sure.

586
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,190
Bye.

587
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,490
Then, I'm leaving first.

588
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,500
Okay.

589
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,970
You should be careful

590
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,230
since you drive home alone.

591
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,240
It's okay.

592
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,090
Bye.

593
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,090
I'll watch you leave.

594
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,360
Okay.

595
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,080
Bye.

596
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,320
Have an early rest.

597
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,570
You sick freak!

598
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,830
Is it you? Is it you?

599
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,920
Nuo, it's me.

600
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,530
It's me.

601
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,180
You... Why are you here?

602
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,170
The netizens can even

603
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,140
find out your address.

604
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,990
I'm a little worried.

605
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,750
Your auntie wanted

606
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,480
to invite you home.

607
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,750
I know you must disagree.

608
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,100
But I feel worried.

609
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,660
So I came to pay a visit.

610
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,100
So...

611
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,120
that car...?

612
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,430
Yes.

613
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,440
During these days,

614
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,590
you've always stayed here?

615
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,180
No. No.

616
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,200
The cousin of your auntie

617
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,440
and I came in shifts.

618
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,060
He came during the daytime.

619
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,360
And I came at night-time.

620
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,560
You...are in such an old age,

621
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,540
why are you still displaying gallantry?

622
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,590
You think

623
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,150
I would feel touched, right?

624
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,950
I don't mean that.

625
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,810
I, I'm afraid that you might have an accident.

626
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,280
If it's really so,

627
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,080
I...

628
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,900
How can I explain this to your mom?

629
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,320
Alright.

630
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,090
You go upstairs.

631
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,350
I'll leave.

632
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,780
You...

633
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,830
Have you eaten anything?

634
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,350
What about

635
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,330
going upstairs and having some water?

636
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,210
Forget it if you don't want to.

637
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,090
I will.

638
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,430
I will.

639
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,300
Be quiet.

640
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,350
Hold on.

641
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,960
Don't...don't grab me.

642
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,710
Be gentle. Be gentle.

643
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,640
Hold on. Hold on.

644
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,280
You're back.

645
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,510
Who's he?

646
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,030
Well.

647
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,600
This is my dad.

648
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,280
And this is Guan Xiaoyu.

649
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,980
Hello, uncle.

650
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:21,890
Hello. Hello.

651
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,730
Hello, uncle.

652
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,830
I'm Guan Xiaoyu's boyfriend.

653
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,670
My name is Ouyang Yifan.

654
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,840
No one will think you are numb even if you keep quiet.

655
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,990
What's wrong with your face?

656
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,330
Could it be that you hit him?

657
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,770
I was a scapegoat.

658
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,110
I just happened to

659
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,290
look pitiful.

660
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,300
Uncle, have a seat.

661
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,760
Don't stand there.

662
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,110
Uncle, sit down. Sit down please.

663
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,590
Thank you.

664
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,560
You must have taken care of

665
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,030
Lingling so much.

666
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,130
It doesn't matter.

667
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,390
Uncle, take a seat first.

668
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,370
Have a seat and I go fetch you some water.

669
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,040
Okay.

670
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,520
Uncle,

671
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,230
why did you come

672
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,320
to pay a visit today?

673
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,930
So that car is yours.

674
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,770
Yes.

675
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,480
It's mine.

676
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,080
Oh my god.

677
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,290
I'm deeply touched

678
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,060
by such deep paternal love.

679
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,440
Maybe next time

680
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,570
when you meet him,

681
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,670
you can smile at him.

682
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,850
I think your father

683
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,610
has been missing it for a long time.

684
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,460
I've heard that

685
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,760
every dad would guard against

686
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,360
his daughter's smile.

687
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,500
And they will strive for it.

688
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,350
I did as what you said.

689
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,330
I smiled at my father.

690
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,480
I didn't expect that he would weep.

691
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,160
At that moment, I suddenly felt that

692
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,470
he seemed old.

693
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,090
Actually, in my childhood,

694
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,620
I always felt my dad

695
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,350
would never age.

696
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,840
But today,

697
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,970
I,

698
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,610
I somehow felt

699
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,170
that he was not so tall

700
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,930
and strong as

701
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,360
I imagined.

702
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,370
He was quite fragile indeed.

703
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,880
Yes.

704
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,860
After we grew up,

705
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,030
our parents aged

706
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,960
before we knew it.

707
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,020
You know, my dad

708
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,000
always called me Nuo.

709
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,800
I felt annoyed

710
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,400
every time

711
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,370
he did,

712
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,680
because he had divorced my mom.

713
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,400
I didn't want him

714
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,450
to call me Nuo.

715
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,040
But I didn't expect

716
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,440
to feel more sorrowful

717
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,760
when he called me Lingling.

718
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,980
You can smile more at him

719
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,790
when you meet him next time.

720
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,190
Okay.

721
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,200
It's getting late.

722
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,540
Have an early rest.

723
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,650
You too.

724
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,040
Good night.

725
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,250
Good night.

726
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,190
And...

727
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,390
I love you.

728
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,910
I love you too.

729
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,890
Alright, have an early rest.

730
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,470
Good night.

731
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,070
Mom,

732
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,080
isn't that enough?

733
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,030
Hang,

734
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,080
it's so late.

735
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,590
Who did you call?

736
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,020
My girlfriend.

737
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,920
Is she Bai Lingling?

738
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,430
Of course.

739
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,030
Now that you love her

740
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,250
and she loves you too,

741
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,550
seek a chance

742
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,600
and invite her home

743
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,700
to have a meal with us.

744
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,120
I'll cook some delicacies for you two.

745
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,010
Really?

746
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,180
Of course.

747
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,270
Alright,

748
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,450
have some hot milk

749
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,370
and then an early rest.

750
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,470
Good night.

751
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,230
Good night.

752
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,260
[Forever is for Ever]

753
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,180
My mom wants to see you.

754
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,440
See you now?

755
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,220
I feel really uneasy.

756
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,390
Yesterday, Headmaster Zheng

757
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,270
told me that for me,

758
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,070
he gave up the chance to

759
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,670
be a lecturer at Huaihai University.

760
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,470
Do you think she wants to talk about this matter with me?

761
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,780
More than that chance.

762
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,860
He gave up

763
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,770
vying for Distinguished Young Scholars as well.

764
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,110
If I were his mom,

765
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,430
I might really want to

766
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,010
break you up.

767
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,440
What should I do?

768
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,740
What should I do?

769
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,250
Don't be anxious.

770
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,450
And you should not deny yourself.

771
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,190
Listen to me.

772
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,320
You are not below him.

773
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,000
You're right.

774
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,770
It's just that

775
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,360
my grades are a little poorer than his.

776
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,250
My achievements are less than his.

777
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,020
My family is somehow poorer than his.

778
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,140
And my background

779
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,000
is somehow complicated.

780
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,100
I'm done.

781
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,040
I am below him

782
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,630
too much.

783
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,140
You see.

784
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,400
For my condition,

785
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,120
I still date Yang Lanhang.

786
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,900
Is it that I don't

787
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,460
have a clear estimation of myself.

788
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,060
No. You're great.

789
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,570
You.

790
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,290
I might as well punch you to wake you up.

791
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,150
Believe me.

792
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:48,720
You should behave

793
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,480
like what you did

794
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,110
to Headmaster Zheng yesterday.

795
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,540
That...that was a special circumstance.

796
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,720
I could not be timid at that moment,

797
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,310
could I?

798
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,020
No.

799
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,580
I think you thought too much.

800
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,140
My auntie is quite nice.

801
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,320
She is your auntie.

802
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,540
Of course, she is nice to you.

803
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,380
It's not that you are dating

804
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,220
Yang Lanhang.

805
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,200
I got an idea.

806
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,840
I pretend to be sick and I won't go.

807
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,640
No.

808
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,690
I still think

809
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,950
sooner or later,

810
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,700
the day of reckoning will come.

811
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,960
Listen to me, you should go.

812
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,380
Come on.

813
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,140
Better a little loss than a long sorrow.

814
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,850
Come on. Get up.

815
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,690
No, what are you doing?

816
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,360
Go. Go. Go.

817
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,170
Pick up a beautiful garment.

818
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,100
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

819
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,790
My dad is not home today.

820
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,590
So there's only my mom,

821
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,150
the housekeeper and me.

822
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,240
Okay.

823
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,370
So you don't need to be reserved.

824
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,670
Just make yourself at home.

825
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,230
Be careful.

826
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,460
Mom, Lingling is here.

827
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,740
Lingling is here.

828
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,080
Come on. Come on. Take a seat.

829
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,840
Hello, auntie.

830
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,220
Ms. Zhang,

831
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,320
bring the fruit here.

832
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,580
Okay.

833
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,150
Pretty girl.

834
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,460
Thank you.

835
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,140
Thanks.

836
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,900
Well, mom,

837
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,870
this is a plant

838
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,080
Lingling selected for you.

839
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,770
I, I

840
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,540
have no idea about whether you will like it or not.

841
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,010
Of course I do.

842
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,810
Plants have long roots

843
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,740
and mean something propitious.

844
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,210
Why don't I like it?

845
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,000
Hang,

846
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,310
you stay with Lingling.

847
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,100
I have specially

848
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,410
cooked soup for Lingling today.

849
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,120
I'm going to see if it is ready.

850
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,170
Auntie,

851
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,190
is there anything

852
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,360
I can do for you?

853
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,160
Look.

854
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,250
Look.

855
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,060
My son is more than

856
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,690
20 years old.

857
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,160
And he has never offered

858
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,170
me some help in the kitchen.

859
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,400
Sure enough, daughter-in-law is more considerate.

860
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,630
Mom,

861
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,440
you might scare her.

862
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,030
Is it that serious?

863
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,880
Lingling, did I scare you?

864
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,680
No. No.

865
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,980
Go, go, go. Go

866
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:43,880
Go.

867
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,860
Go. Go.

868
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,620
Ms. Zhang, you did a great job today.

869
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,550
There's no work for you anymore.

870
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,600
You can go back early.

871
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,440
Okay. Okay.

872
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,110
Thank you for your great work.

873
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:58,870

as long as this has not been figured out,

1046
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,360
you have to suffer shame

1047
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,530
because of it.

1048
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:36,920
Lingling

1049
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:37,930
must be more anxious

1050
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,680
than each of us.

1051
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,030
A clean hand wants no washing.

1052
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,250
There's no use to be anxious.

1053
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,190
Lingling?

1054
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,320
How's it?

1055
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,450
But

1056
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:52,880
I believe

1057
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,850
that Zoey is still alive.

1058
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,070
It must still be there.

1059
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,710
Tomorrow I'll go there again.

1060
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,340
I'll go there tomorrow.

1061
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,140
Let's go there in shifts.

1062
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,190
We can find it sooner or later.

1063
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,370
Okay.

1064
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,550
No going anymore.

1065
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,360
Why don't you want us to go?

1066
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,250
Didn't you notice that

1067
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,350
Zhang was silent?

1068
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,980
We are scientific researchers,

1069
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,290
instead of criminal investigators.

1070
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,500
Each minute should

1071
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,340
be treasured.

1072
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,390
I don't want you

1073
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,910
to waste your time and energy here.

1074
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,530
I don't think it is a waste.

1075
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,380
As long as I can prove your innocence,

1076
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,430
I can even abandon my slumber.

1077
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:35,970
Alright.

1078
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,200
I believe you.

1079
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,340
What about others?

1080
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,770
And I don't

1081
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,770
care about these.

1082
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,240
I know you are for my sake.

1083
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,640
And, the academic board

1084
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,940
has plunged into an investigation, right?

1085
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,700
They will work out the truth sooner or later.

1086
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,600
Then when will they?

1087
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,860
As long as they don't find the truth,

1088
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,450
netizens will

1089
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,710
keep abusing you.

1090
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,150
Abuse? Then just let them abuse.

1091
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,280
They can't harm me physically anyway.

1092
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,580
What's more, I'm not the only victim.

1093
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,170
See,

1094
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,930
you are abused.

1095
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,810
Li Feifei is also abused.

1096
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,440
Zheng....

1097
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,110
Wait a minute.

1098
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,080
It's okay if they abuse me.

1099
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,100
See what relationship we two have.

1100
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,480
Of course, they can abuse me.

1101
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,000
But why do they abuse Li Feifei?

1102
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,170
Who is Li Feifei?

1103
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,100
What's the relationship between you and her?

1104
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,240
Why is she qualified to be abused?

1105
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,370
You, according to your logic,

1106
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,420
why do they

1107
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,300
abuse Zheng Minghao?

1108
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,610
The photo of Zheng Minghao's

1109
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,740
saving a seat in the study room for you

1110
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,000
has...has been exposed.

1111
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,630
Why don't they expose

1112
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,390
the photo of mine?

1113
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,810
I saved a seat for you, too.

1114
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,530
You...

1115
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,330
you lost to him because of your style.

1116
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:27,710
I...?

1117
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,140
When he saved a seat for me,

1118
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,810
he dressed like

1119
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,820
a hot-blooded teenager

1120
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,830
and brought such a big toy bear.

1121
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,550
Of course others would take photos of him.

1122
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,890
Who would notice you?

1123
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:39,510
So you are saying that

1124
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,980
I'm too low-key?

1125
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,670
I prefer low-key people.

1126
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,550
It's good to be low-key.

1127
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,330
Is it?

1128
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,300
Really?

1129
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,050
Alright.

1130
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,020
To be honest, whether Zheng Minghao

1131
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,780
or Li Feifei,

1132
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,990
or anyone else,

1133
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,000
are suffering

1134
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,930
such unexpected accidents because of us.

1135
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,150
Should we send a message to them

1136
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,040
to show our regret?

1137
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,600
You're right.

1138
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,040
But I don't want you to

1139
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,300
send a message to Li Feifei.

1140
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,260
I'll feel jealous.

1141
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,610
Let me do it for you.

1142
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,090
Then, for the sake of fairness,

1143
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,720
let me send a message to Zheng Minghao.

1144
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,660
Okay. Deal.

1145
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,390
Right.

1146
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,780
You should forget about Zoey.

1147
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,950
I have to go there anyway.

1148
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,790
Let me tell you....

1149
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,680
Okay.

1150
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,990
Then I'll go with you.

1151
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,840
Don't get others involved.

1152
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,230
Alright.

1153
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,580
[A card every girl is eager for]

1154
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,890
Auntie actually gave you

1155
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,860
a custom-made Centurion Card

1156
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,410
as a gift for your first meeting.

1157
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,510
Is this rare?

1158
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,360
Just a VIP card anyway.

1159
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:55,780
Free parking

1160
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,590
and a 15 percent discount when shopping.

1161
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,560
Why do they prefer a card

1162
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,190
as a gift?

1163
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,990
Do they

1164
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,960
think it saves space the best?

1165
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,270
I can't afford it

1166
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,190
even if she offers me the best discount.

1167
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,110
I have no money

1168
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,710
and no car either.

1169
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,800
Parking has nothing

1170
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,680
to do with me.

1171
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,570
Here.

1172
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:11,530
You two take it.

1173
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,250
I don't need it either.

1174
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,300
I've already had a lot.

1175
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:15,730
Really?

1176
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,550
Do you two have

1177
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,520
any misunderstanding about this card?

1178
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,790
This is a custom-made Centurion Card of SP.

1179
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:23,750
There's few in total.

1180
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,800
And it is not for sale.

1181
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,990
Auntie didn't mean

1182
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,550
some discounts when shopping.

1183
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,350
You can just take what you want at SP.

1184
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,110
For free.

1185
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,300
Let me have a look.

1186
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,220
You said you don't need it.

1187
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,770
You said it.

1188
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,400
I'll go shopping with you.

1189
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:36,900
I'll go shopping with you.

1190
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,280
With me?

1191
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,030
What about buying

1192
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,750
some clothes for Moustache?

1193
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,940
You are rich!
