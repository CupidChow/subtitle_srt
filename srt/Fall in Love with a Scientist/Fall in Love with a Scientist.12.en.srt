[Episode 12]

4
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,380
I was wondering why you look so familiar.

5
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,860
Are you really Li Feifei?

6
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,940
Are you the guru's

7
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,740
girlfriend?

8
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,700
Have a guess.

9
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,220
Got it.

10
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,090
What girlfriend.

11
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,020
We are just friends.

12
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,100
What friends?

13
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,780
You are a life saver

14
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,979
to me.

15
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,340
Not that much.

16
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,740
I just told her the way

17
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,020
when she was abroad.

18
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,900
That's it.

19
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,100
That's not it.

20
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,500
Let me tell you.

21
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,620
I was shooting a commercial abroad

22
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,020
and I came across

23
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,300
a parade.

24
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,860
I lost my team

25
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,700
in the crowd.

26
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,820
I was wearing

27
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,300
high heels

28
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,020
and had no money.

29
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,260
I didn't have my phone on me, either.

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,060
Luckily, I met Hang.

31
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,100
Or I would be too panicked

32
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,579
to do anything.

33
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,700
So,

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,620
it is very important

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
to learn English well.

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,460
Look at you.

37
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,940
Bai,

38
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,420
is he this cool

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,620
when he is with you?

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,620
He's okay.

41
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,140
Right?

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,940
Okay.

43
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,500
Guru can show you our lab

44
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,900
if you have time.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,220
Is it okay?

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,180
Absolutely not.

47
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,500

48

49

Well...

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,380
Excuse me.

51
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,940
I need to study

52
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,060

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,460
OK.

Bye.

56

Bye.

57

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,180
OK.

60
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,620
Bye, Yang.

61
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,340
Bye.

62
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,940
What's up?

63
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,180
What are you doing?

64
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,820
I need to tell you.

65
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,620
I'm great.

66
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,850
I went to the market today

67
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,460
and bought two bones of cow.

68
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
I'm making soup of bones now.

69
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,420
It will probably be finished

70

after a night.

71

Well,

72
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,180
I will take it to you

73
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,260
before my meeting tomorrow.

74
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,820
Tell me the address quickly.

75
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,339
I broke my brain,

76
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,779
not my legs.

77
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,540
Will the bone soup help?

78
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,540
I have already made it.

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,820
You have to eat it.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,980
Don't talk nonsense.

81
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,180
Give me your address quickly.

if you are not hurt

84

for saving me,

85
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,260
I will never do this.

86

It's super tiring, OK?

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,020
Alright.

88

You are pretty busy lately, right?

89
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,980
Don't come and go everywhere.

90
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,580
The doctor has told me

91
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,740
to recover in a quiet condition.

92
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,370

you will be alright in a few days?

96

I, I don't know.

97
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,580
Since the doctor said it,

98
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,860

So pretty.

I like it very much.

Then I'm relieved.

The shopkeeper of the flower shop

137

is very enthusiastic to him,

138
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,820
and asked him why

139

he didn't buy flowers these days.

140
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,260
I only know it afterwards that

141
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,580
Geng Panpan used to buy

142
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,900
a bunch of fresh red rose

143
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,580
from her

144
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,140
every day.

145
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,340
That is to say,

146
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,900
he has someone in mind.

147
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,010
But, why do I think

148
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,420
he likes you

149

for a long time.

150
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,890
It is natural that

151
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,420
he likes me.

152
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,780
I'm so glamorous.

153
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,100
But I didn't receive the flowers.

154
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,220
So, it's not me.

155
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,900
Gong told me that

156

you are really busy these days.

157
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,700
Have I made you any trouble

158
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,060
by inviting you for dinner

159
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,300
all of a sudden?

160
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,580
No.

Does Bai

have a crush on you?

164
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,840
I feel that she doesn't like me very much.

165
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,020
That probably means

166
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,730
she likes you.

167
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,660
Not possible.

Here.

There is a doggie here.

Why are you here alone?

Look at it.

176
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,220
It needs to go to the hospital.

Let's take it to the hospital quickly.

178

OK.

Hi.

No problem.

Close?

She said that

213
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,260
I showed her the way two years ago abroad,

214

That's Li Feifei!

224
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,100
And I paid for it at last.

225
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,700
Or you would like her to pay for it?

226
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,770
She said she would like to thank me

227
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,460
and treat me to dinner.

228

Shouldn't she

pay for it?

230

You don't understand.

234

No wonder you are still single.

Are you still busy?

you can ask me anytime.

I don't want to ask you.

It's okay if you don't ask me,

250
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
but at least you need to ask someone

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,510
Then,

maybe it's Yang Lanhang.

Certainly.

266

It's a good opportunity.

Then why didn't you ask?

268
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,610
I had a chance to ask,

but

270

She's a famous actress.

274

So, you don't care at all?

Why should I care?

281

It's none of my business.

Right.

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,700
saying that he would buy his girlfriend a gift

356
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,900
with the extra money.

357
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,500
# [13-16床]

358
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,500
Here.

359
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,570
This is his room.

360
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,410
What? You won't get in?

361
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,500
No.

362
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,380
I have some work to do suddenly

363
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,540
and have to go now.

364
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,820
Right,

365
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,860
can you keep me

366
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,660
coming by

367
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,580
a secret?

368
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,260
Thank you.

369
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,260
What kind of girlfriend

370
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,260
is this?

371
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,460
# [13-16床]

372
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,540
Zhang,

373
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,700
is guru having a day-off today?

374
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,930
He has worked without rest for over a month.

375
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,660
Professor has given him two days off.

376
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:57,860
Speaking of this,

377
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,650
it's about guru's birthday.

378
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,580
What do you give him every year?

379
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,260
Tell me and I can have a reference.

380
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,780
Is his birthday coming?

381
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:05,619
When?

382
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,300
What?

383
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:09,670
You, you...

384
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,260
Hold on.

385
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,180
Don't tell me.

386
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,140
If you tell me, I have to give him a gift.

387
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,380
I don't want to.

388
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,300
Why does guru have a friend

389
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,700
like you?

390
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,579
Bai,

391
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,810
do you know guru's birthday is coming?

392
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,340
No.

393
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,100
What?

394
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,330
It's in four or five months.

395
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,700
It's coming soon.

396
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,140
What should we

397
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,020
give him?

398
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,570
We still have four or five months.

399
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,140
Why are you rushing?

400
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,620
We need to give the gift in the end.

401
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,860
I'd rather be early than late.

402
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,540
Are you taking this opportunity

403
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,700
to bribe him

404
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
for taking you to Shenzhen?

405
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,260
Who said so?

406
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
My heart to guru

407
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,450
is so pure.

408
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,290
The God can prove it.

409
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,460
You are so ungrateful.

410
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,260
Guru has helped you so much.

411
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,140
If it were not him, there would not be you.

412
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,650
You need to be grateful.

413
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,580
If it were not him, there would not be me.

414
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Then he is not he,

415
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,980
he is my mother.

416
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,500
Alright, alright.

417
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,090
I know.

418
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,770
Grateful.

419
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,900
Don't worry.

420
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,260
I need to continue my study.

421
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,940
It is OK to print it.

422
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,420
But there are many

423
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,460
potential problems

424
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,970
for your biodegradable stent.

425
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:33,500
First,

426
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,460
how to guarantee the differentiation

427
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
of the cell?

428
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,100
Second,

429
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,180
what to do with the effect

430
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,110
the product of the degradable stent

431
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,060
have to the environment?

432
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,260
Third,

433
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,830
how to control

434
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,300
the mechanical strength

435
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,230
of the growing tissue?

436
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,490
I think you are being fanciful.

437
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:56,820
Dad,

438
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,150
didn't all innovation

439
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,940
come from fancy?

440
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,880
Why do you have such thoughts?

441
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,670
Are you,

442
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,460
are you old?

443
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,460
Well,

444
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,100
how does it relate to oldness?

445
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,180
It is okay to innovate.

446
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,780
But you need to have

447
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,140
theoretical basis,

448
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,980
or it is not science,

449
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,660
it's fiction.

450
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,660
Yes.

451
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,500
Fiction.

452
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,460
Here, I will present you

453
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,770
my research result.

454
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,500
It will astonish you.

455
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,810
No.

456
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,340
It's confidential.

457
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,540
Confidential?

458
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,780
If you don't have it, it's okay.

459
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,140
I won't laugh at you, right?

460
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,100
It's confidential!

461
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,050
I cannot show you even if you laugh at me.

462
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,980
Stop. Don't shout.

463
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,340
Why do you two fight

464
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,380
as long as you meet?

465
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,610
Didn't I set the rule of

466
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,660
no talking work at home?

467
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,170
It's your son who has

468
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,980
some questions for me

469
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,300
It's your husband who is extremely

470
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,380
interested in my study.

471
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,010
Is it sweet?

472
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,940
After the meal,

473
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,820
you two

474
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,500
accompany me to go shopping.

475
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
Why go shopping?

476
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,130
I have a banquet in my Group next week.

477
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,300
It's really important.

478
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,060
You two need to help me

479
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,330
get prepared.

480
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,530
-I will not go. 
-I will not go.

481
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:29,980
You!

482
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,630
Dad.

483
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,380
The fruit is so tasty.

484
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,380
Try it.

485
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,620
Have some more.

486
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,100
It's good for health.

487
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,610
I will read the documents first.

488
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,700
If you see anything good,

489
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,500
just tell me.

490
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,860
What are you thinking?

491
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,740
What?

492
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,940
What did you say?

493
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,740
I said I would read the documents first.

494
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,460
If you

495
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,330
saw something good,

496
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,460
just tell me.

497
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,860
You are so generous to Yang Lanhang.

498
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,820
You came here to buy him a gift.

499
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,300
You are making a huge budget.

500
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,060
It's not about budget.

501
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,700
I'm being grateful.

502
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,500
Think about it.

503
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,330
If he didn't

504
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,020
apply for the sanatorium for grandma,

505
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,900
I need to pay a great deal

506
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,490
for grandma's psychologist.

507
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,580
And he saved grandma's life.

508
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,100
Even if it's not his birthday,

509
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,340
I should thank him.

510
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,340
OK. Let's have a look.

511
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,010
Let's go.

512
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,580
What are you doing?

513
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,300
You are not considering buying this

514
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,020
for Yang Lanhang?

515
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,380
I'm sure he won't like it.

516
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,330
If you want to take a look,

517
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,540
I will accompany you some other day.

518
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,220
How about this?

519
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,420
You go take a look around,

520
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,980
and I will find you later.

521
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,060
I'll call you.

522
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,700
Deal.

523
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,220
Hello,

524
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,890
can I have a look

525
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,580
at this one, please?

526
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,740
Sure. Wait a moment.

527
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:14,900
Thank you.

528
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,930
Here, Miss.

529
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,130
Dad, is it finished?

530
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,380
Not yet. Take it easy.

531
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,180
It will be finished in a minute.

532
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,940
I like this one, too.

533
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,900
This one is nice.

534
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,740
Yes.

535
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,620
OK.

536
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,700
Let's take this one.

537
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,180
I think that color is nice,

538
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,740
and the style is good,

539
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,820
except for its furs.

540
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,300
This wind coat is nice.

541
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,180
# [关潇郁]

542
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,380
That's Nuo.

543
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:43,980
Nuo,

544
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,970
why are you here?

545
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,460
Your father is too happy seeing you

546
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,380
to think clearly.

547
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,580
What else can she do?

548
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,340
Undoubtedly she is buying stuff.

549
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,020
Nuo,

550
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,210
are you here alone?

551
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,780
What do you like?

552
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,980
I can give you advice.

553
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,260
How have you been?

554
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,940
Your father is worried.

555
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,980
He has a lot to tell you.

556
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,060
Let's have dinner tonight,

557
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,740
and we can talk slowly.

558
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,020
Right.

559
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,980
If you like anything,

560
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,850
tell your aunt.

561
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,460
She can give you advice.

562
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,460
She has a good taste.

563
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,020
Only you bumpkin thinks

564
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,420
I have a good taste.

565
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,980
How do I know

566
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,410
what young people like?

567
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:33,860
Nuo,

568
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,980
which do you like?

569
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,700
I'll buy it for you.

570
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,460
No need.

571
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,610
My name is Bai Lingling, not Nuo.

572
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,100
You got the wrong person.

573
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,180
It's the same.

574
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,300
You can name yourself whatever you like.

575
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,620
This looks really nice.

576
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,260
I didn't notice it just now.

577
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,220
Look.

578
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,780
She has a good taste

579
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,620
herself.

580
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,340
I'll pay for it.

581
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Hi. I'll pay the bill.

582
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,420
Hi.

583
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:05,940
OK.

584
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,620
It's fine.

585
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,260
I'll buy it.

586
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,780
Thanks.

587
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,500
OK, Miss.

588
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,740
It's 13,000 yuan.

589
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,100
Let me pay the bill.

590
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,700
No. No.

591
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,570
# [余额不足]

592
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,300
Sorry, Miss.

593
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,090
You don't have enough

594
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,660
money in your bank card.

595
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,620
Use mine.

596
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,500
No. I mean it.

597
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,300
I got the wrong card.

598
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,580
I'll look for another one.

599
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,170
Hey,

600
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,940
I know you have money.

601
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,690
Save your money

602
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,170
to buy some tasty food.

603
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,380
No. I...

604
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,260
I'm looking for a new card.

605
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,060
Stop looking for it.

606
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,500
I have your card.

607
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,330
There it is.

608
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,380
The code is your birthday.

609
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,180
Lingling,

610
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,380
is this your boyfriend?

611
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,340
Yes.

612
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,770
Great.

613
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,900
Let's have a meal together.

614
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,740
No need.

615
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,100
Miss. Your coat.

616
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,900
Thanks for what you did.

617
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,090
I feel kind of embarrassed

618
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,700
that you saw this.

619
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,260
Who are they?

620
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,740
I heard them call you Nuo

621
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,220
when I came in.

622
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,580
Never mind.

623
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,740
I'm just asking.

624
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,940
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

625
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,890
I'll tell you.

626
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,300
The man is my father.

627
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,020
The woman is my step-mother.

628
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,860
My name

629
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,460
was Shi Nuoling.

630
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,460
After my parents divorced,

631
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
I didn't want to bear his family name.

632
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,450
So I changed my name into Bai Lingling.

633
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,060
That's all.

634
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,620
You seem to have a poor relationship.

635
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,940
It's not a poor relationship.

636
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,340
In fact, we barely have connections.

637
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,540
The service counter is over there.

638
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,020
Let's return

639
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,820
this coat.

640
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,540
Why?

641
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,940
It's a gift from me.

642
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,100
No.

643
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,980
This... This is valuable.

644
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,620
Consider it as a gift

645
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,540
to celebrate you passed your postgraduate entrance exams.

646
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,540
You don't need to do this.

647
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,300
I'm OK with

648
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,690
my pullovers.

649
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,620
They are quite comfortable.

650
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,260
Really.

651
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,820
If I wear

652
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,140
such a valuable coat,

653
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,860
I will feel

654
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,100
uncomfortable,

655
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,940
and I will be afraid of making it dirty

656
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,460
or staining it.

657
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,980
Sometimes,

658
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,140
expensive things are not always the best.

659
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,820
The best is what suits you.

660
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
Expensive things are not always the best.

661
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,020
The best is what suits you.

662
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:31,970
Oh,

663
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,060
why is the code of your bank card

664
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,060
my birthday?

665
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,500
You need to think about every aspect if you decide to put on a show.

666
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,340
So I changed it in advance.

667
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,620
It's fine if you don't want to

668
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,900
accept my gift.

669
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,300
Let me treat you to dinner.

670
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,620
I have always wanted to make an appointment,

671
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
but I never made it.

672
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,140
What do you say?

673
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,340
OK.

674
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,460
I happen to have several

675
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,140
questions about my major

676
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,180
to consult you.

677
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,660
Is that her?

678
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,740
Why are you here?

679
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,820
Buying clothes.

680
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,350
Hang,

681
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,710
honestly,

682
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,150
I don't have much time to indulge myself.

683
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,180
I feel eased and free

684
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
only when

685
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,500
I'm with you.

686
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,020
What happened?

687
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,300
Your parents will

688
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,380
cut their ties with you?

689
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,500
Go to hell.

690
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,130
My dad wants me back in his company.

691
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,680
There will be a gala dinner at SP Group next week.

692
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,700
My dad plans to

693
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,850
introduce me to everyone officially.

694
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,140
What about our company?

695
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,420
Don't worry.

696
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,490
I can manage both.

697
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,620
Actually, my dad doesn't

698
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,820
need me much.

699
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,890
He just wants to keep an eye on me,

700
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,340
in case I cause any troubles.

701
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,460
I think this is the first time

702
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,550
I hear Ouyang

703
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,860
talking so much.

704
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,500
You are not going to the lab?

705
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,870
What lab?

706
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,100
You think

707
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,500
I'm Yinfan, right?

708
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,600
So you are...

709
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,510
You are...

710
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,540
You are Ouyang Yifan.

711
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,000
You two look exactly alike.

712
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,540
As a matter of fact,

713
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,660
I endured many hardships

714
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,300
because of you.

715
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,320
Your friend Guan Xiaoyu,

716
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,620
she's got a sense of justice.

717
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,980
I heard

718
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,340
about that thing.

719
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,220
She is a little bit

720
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,180
impulsive indeed.

721
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,420
But she did it

722
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,740
for me.

723
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,180
Anyway,

724
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,260
I apologize.

725
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,580
I'm very sorry.

726
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,850
Forget it.

727
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,020
Let bygones be bygones.

728
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,540
You don't need to apologize.

729
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,500
You two are very close.

730
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,550
Does she listen to your words?

731
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,780
Can you make an arrangement?

732
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,580
Tell her to

733
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
dump the little boy.

734
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,340
and be with me.

735
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,860
I don't think I can arrange this.

736
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:23,920
It's OK.

737
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,970
Let's friend each other on WeChat.

738
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,520
I'll scan your QR Code.

739
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,260
Come on.

740
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,350
OK. OK. OK.

741
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,570
Scan. Scan. Scan.

742
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,150
I...

743
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,930
# [添加到通讯录]

744
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,260
Your profile photo is so cute.

745
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,100
You think so?

746
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,400
I think it's very cute, too.

747
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,700
I've been using it for years.

748
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,260
Yang,

749
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,850
we haven't friended each other.

750
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,110
Come on. Scan.

751
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,340
He is not important.

752
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,980
You keep an eye on Guan Xiaoyu for me.

753
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,410
Once she breaks up with that boy,

754
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,250
you tell me immediately.

755
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,590
I'll come to her right away.

756
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,990
No problem.

757
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,600
But I'm curious about something.

758
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,800
You seem to have made

759
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,060
many girlfriends,

760
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,580
why won't you

761
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,250
let Xiaoxiao go?

762
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,940
Compared with

763
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,020
other girls I met, I think

764
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,530
she is...

765
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,560
Nothing.

766
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,570
I...

767
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,920
I just need to wipe out

768
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,430
the only stain

769
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,900
in my love history.

770
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:41,950
Yes.

771
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,500
Stain.

772
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,950
Panpan,

773
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,140
why are you here?

774
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,440
I left the hospital.

775
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,080
The doctor said

776
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,640
you need to rest for several days.

777
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,320
I thought it would cause you trouble

778
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,370
to pick me up.

779
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,940
Let's go inside.

780
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,000
What?

781
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,100
Don't you like the bracelet

782
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,530
I gave to you?

783
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,719
I never wore it.

784
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,230
Tomorrow you can return...

785
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,070
If you don't like it,

786
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,540
I can exchange it for another one.

787
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,210
Do you like me?

788
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,590
Yes.

789
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,400
I didn't know

790
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,290
those roses were from you

791
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,100
until yesterday.

792
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,780
Yes.

793
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:08,890
OK.

794
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,040
It's normal

795
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,010
that you like me.

796
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:14,810
We don't need to

797
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,190
discuss it.

798
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,080
But...

799
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,930
Why are you standing there? Come here and sit.

800
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,600
OK. OK. OK.

801
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,450
But,

802
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,380
there is one thing

803
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,970
we need to talk about.

804
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,050
Just relax yourself.

805
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,520
You want to be courageous to pursue love.

806
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,120
I support you.

807
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,950
But

808
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,880
you are a student.

809
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,230
The money you spent

810
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,230
is from your family.

811
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,540
You should do what's within your capability.

812
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,800
Do you think

813
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,090
I will be happy

814
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,230
when I know you saved the money

815
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,330
of your hospitalization expenses

816
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,540
to buy me a gift?

817
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,220
What hospitalization expenses?

818
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,320
I already know it.

819
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,450
Stop pretending.

820
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,300
This is why you

821
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,030
didn't want me to see you

822
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,320
or pick you up.

823
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,400
You should have been able to

824
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,620
live in a better ward in the hospital.

825
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,880
But you didn't

826
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,120
because of that bracelet.

827
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,630
I'm a man.

828
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,640
I'm not fragile.

829
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,520
Meanwhile,

830
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,950
every ward looks the same to me.

831
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,660
Look,

832
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,580
I'm better now.

833
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,450
That's not what I mean.

834
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,280
I think it's the thought that counts.

835
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,540
Not money.

836
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,180
Xiaoxiao, don't be mad.

837
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,350
I like you

838
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,440
and I want to be nice to you.

839
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,630
I don't know what else

840
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,970
I can do.

841
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,100
You...

842
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,450
Will you be my girlfriend?

843
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,750
About this,

844
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,680
I can't tell you right now.

845
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,630
But I think you are a good guy.

846
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,750
So,

847
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,800
how about this?

848
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,690
We'll try it.

849
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,030
Don't

850
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,800
always think about spending money on me.

851
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,180
Use your heart

852
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,400
to pursue me.

853
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,080
I will just

854
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,220
wait and see.

855
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,280
What do you think?

856
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,310
I called Doctor Li

857
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,310
yesterday.

858
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,780
He said your grandmother is in good condition.

859
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,050
Oh,

860
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,230
I have something

861
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,660
to tell you.

862
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,170
It's about the way of

863
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,440
seeding heart valve cells.

864
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,740
I have some

865
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,590
whimsical ideas.

866
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Tell me.

867
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,830
What do you think

868
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,330
of 3D printing?

869
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,420
This is what I'm thinking.

870
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,280
Maybe we can use,

871
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,110
for example,

872
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,550
MRI or

873
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,040
CT

874
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,740
to obtain the shape of the heart valves

875
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,780
of the patient in advance.

876
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,120
Based on this shape,

877
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,640
we can design its stent

878
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,260
and then we can print

879
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,560
the cells and stent.

880
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,160
What do you think...

881
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,950
You and I have the same thoughts.

882
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,790
I was also thinking about 3D printing,

883
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,680
and I have started

884
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,600
modeling recently.

885
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,690
If you are interested,

886
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,830
you can come to my house.

887
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,840
My dad is an expert in this field.

888
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,040
In fact, I went home

889
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,400
to discuss with him.

890
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,380
But my mom dragged me out to go shopping with her

891
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,760
in the middle of the discussion.

892
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,090
You have a good family relationship.

893
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,310
Yes.

894
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,790
My mom said she strived to make money

895
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,760
just to become a strong backing

896
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,770
of my dad.

897
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,160
My dad was crazy about scientific researches

898
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,630
when he was in school.

899
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,850
He spent most of his time

900
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,070
in labs.

901
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,000
He had rough years in the beginning,

902
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,760
unable to get fund for his projects.

903
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,110
My mom thought

904
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,740
he couldn't continue like this.

905
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,740
It's better relying on yourself than asking for help from others.

906
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,540
So she decided to

907
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,840
venture into a business.

908
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,780
It turned out that her business got better and better.

909
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,710
And my dad stepped up efforts to

910
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,720
win several scientific research awards in a row,

911
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,510
possibly because he's afraid that he wouldn't

912
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,980
have a say in the family.

913
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,710
It's nice.

914
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,720
Your parents' love with mutual accomplishments

915
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,400
and mutual support

916
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,000
is really nice.

917
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,780
Yes.

918
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,160
Although they always

919
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,420
quarrel with each other,

920
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,670
they know each other better than

921
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,990
anyone in the world.

922
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,960
I always think

923
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,520
if only I can

924
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,740
live like them

925
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,450
with my wife in the future.

926
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,010
A female star should make

927
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,020
lots of money, I guess.

928
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,040
Li Feifei.

929
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,520
Isn't she your girlfriend?

930
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,700
Who told you that

931
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,790
she's my girlfriend?

932
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,430
I don't like her at all.

933
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,860
What's more, what I said has nothing

934
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,620
to do with money.

935
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,850
She is Li Feifei.

936
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,360
She is gorgeous.

937
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,070
Yang,

938
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,420
are you not very

939
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,970
clear about your positioning?

940
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,260
Here.

941
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
I already have someone I like.

942
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,030
I... I'll do it.

943
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,080
It's fine.

944
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,340
I like cutting meat.

945
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,520
Well...

946
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,740
This... This is my fork.

947
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,810
Go ahead with your cutting.

948
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,660
Thanks.

949
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,550
What about you?

950
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,870
Do you have someone you like?

951
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,300
I won't call him someone I like.

952
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,560
He is my boyfriend.

953
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,570
What kind of person is he？

954
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,990
My boyfriend

955
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,630
is a

956
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,330
funny, knowledgeable,

957
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,090
and kind person.

958
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,190
He is very thoughtful

959
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,750
and he always

960
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,750
sticks to his own principles.

961
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,060
He will

962
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,160
never slack off

963
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,880
and is very positive.

964
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,600
Anyway, he is a

965
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,200
very, very nice guy.

966
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,220
I was praising my boyfriend。

967
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,950
Why are you so glad?

968
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,090
I...

969
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,390
I feel happy for you.

970
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,790
Thanks.

971
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,010
# [杨岚航的想象世界]

972
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,270
The degradation

973
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,530
and physical behavior of materials.

974
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,500
Don't read it while you're walking.

975
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,440
# -太危险了
-和化学性质有关

976
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,530
Polymer...

977
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,070
Are you alright?

978
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,460
I'm OK. I'm OK.

979
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,170
Thank you.

980
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,390
Bai, let's go and have a meal.

981
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,310
I need to attend the self-study class.

982
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,150
Forget about your self-study.

983
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:39,990
Let's go and have a meal.

984
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,580
Come on.

985
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,300
You are really....
