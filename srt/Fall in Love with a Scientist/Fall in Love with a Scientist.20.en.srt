00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,690
You think I want to

180
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,570
stay here?

181
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,250
I can't go back.

182
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,480
Hang said their lab

183
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,150
has an after-class academic

184
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,880
seminar at home.

185
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,520
If I go back now,

186
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,940
I will not only interrupt them,

187
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:09,910
but also hinder the progress

188
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,380
of the society and mankind.

189
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,930
I can't do that.

190
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,590
Let's watch a movie.

191
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,910
Do you like horror movies?

192
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,370
Take it easy.

193
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,330
Careful.

194
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,170
Here.

195
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,690
Careful. Careful.

196
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,830
I know Lanhang is good at cooking.

197
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,790
I didn't expect Lingling

198
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,140
to be a good cook.

199
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,610
Here.

200
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,950
I think they say you'd better

201
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,630
find someone who is complementary to yourself.

202
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,100
You are outdated.

203
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,280
Who said they have to be complementary?

204
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,580
Kid, you first.

205
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,840
Why?

206
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,480
It seems Bai really considers

207
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,610
herself as the hostess.

208
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,080
What are you talking about?

209
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,630
Do you believe I and Yang Lanhang

210
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,680
will double kill you?

211
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,030
Choose your words carefully.

212
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,490
Here, Jing.

213
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,620
Come on. Sorry.

214
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,770
Let's celebrate and

215
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,659
hope you can double kill.

216
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,550
And let's hope everyone

217
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,860
can find the loved one.

218
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,200
Every Jack has his Jill.

219
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,290
-Cheers. Cheers.
-Great.

220
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,920
Cheers.

221
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,010
Cheers. Cheers.

222
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,520
Cheers.

223
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:03,960
Don't drink too much.

224
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,350
Come on.

225
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,730
Have some dishes.

226
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,570
They taste better when they are warm.

227
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,080
Come on.

228
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,090
I think this fish is nice.

229
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,390
I'll have some.

230
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,770
Go ahead.

231
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,530
Here, shrimp paste.

232
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,630
I specially made it for you.

233
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,090
Thanks.

234
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,980
You have some.

235
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,070
You too.

236
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,870
Bai,

237
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:19,920
the fish you made

238
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,220
tastes like take-out.

239
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,450
Put down your chopsticks. Stop eating.

240
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,460
Here.

241
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,299
Just put there.

242
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:36,760
Come here.

243
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,900
Help me with my sleeve.

244
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,580
Thank you.

245
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,350
I invited you guys,

246
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,150
but you bought the food ingredients

247
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,200
and you cooked the meal.

248
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,180
And now you are washing dishes.

249
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,310
You are my girlfriend,

250
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,950
not here to do things for me.

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,250
What are you thinking about?

252
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,100
I just think

253
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,520
you don't feel well recently,

254
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,740
and I want you to get more rest.

255
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,700
Just wait.

256
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,500
When you recover,

257
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,260
I'll let you know

258
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,890
who is the real boss.

259
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,780
Really?

260
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,650
OK. Then...

261
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,620
I'll keep you company.

262
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,190
I'm really happy today.

263
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,540
There have never been

264
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,750
so many people in the house.

265
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,810
Every dish you made

266
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,950
is also delicious.

267
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,580
And I like them.

268
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,750
Although I always said I'm a genius,

269
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,430
I just

270
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,280
said it casually.

271
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,760
I don't make as much money as my mom.

272
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,140
I'm not as good as my father

273
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,570
in scientific research achievements.

274
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,170
I'm not the best

275
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,390
among the peers.

276
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,480
But fortunately,

277
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,160
my eyes are sharp,

278
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,810
finding you to be my girlfriend.

279
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,870
One and only, and the best.

280
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm flattered.

281
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,790
I'm not as good as you said.

282
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,580
Alright. Alright.

283
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,460
Don't wash it.

284
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,640
You are almost breaking the cup.

285
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:02,940
Come.

286
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:03,990
Come.

287
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,840
I think I can't

288
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,680
let my girlfriend

289
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,650
do housework anymore.

290
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,450
Because it will waste too much water.

291
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,890
Wait.

292
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,020
You tell me honestly.

293
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,330
Did you Google

294
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,430
romantic words?

295
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,030
You just reminded me

296
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,950
that you confessed

297
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
your feelings to me.

298
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,940
That's the shame of my life.

299
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,150
Don't mention it again, OK?

300
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,740
No.

301
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,790
At least I want to

302
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,300
do what I wanted

303
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,060
to do.

304
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,140
Will you let me wash dishes or not?

305
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,240
There are so many to be washed.

306
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,500
You just go out first, out.

307
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,070
Don't wash them.

308
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,350
It's getting late. You...

309
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,210
You should stay.

310
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,530
Wait. Stay?

311
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,290
Am I

312
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,810
sleeping here today?

313
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,420
Ouyang and Guan Xiaoyu

314
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,470
are in your house now.

315
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,070
So I'm thinking,

316
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,380
should we give them

317
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,520
a chance?

318
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,600
Don't wash them.

319
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,940
I will

320
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,670
wash them later.

321
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,310
[So that's what it is, Qianchuan.]

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,790
Oh man.

323
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,590
I've watched

324
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,770
this movie for three times.

325
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,670
I'm immune, OK?

326
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,090
I...

327
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,850
Am I not allowed to be scared?

328
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,190
Why did you want to watch

329
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,170
a horror movie if you are scared?

330
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,230
Am I not qualified to

331
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,950
watch a horror movie for being scared?

332
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,330
Don't you know that

333
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
the more one is scared,

334
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,980
the more he wants to watch a horror movie?

335
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,990
Why don't you just go back to watch it

336
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,370
by yourself if you are scared?

337
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,850
I can't go back,

338
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,070
because Bai Lingling hasn't come back yet.

339
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,160
Does it matter

340
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,000
if she comes back

341
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,010
or not?

342
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,080
If she doesn't come back,

343
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,340
that means she is at my home.

344
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,230
Why should I go back?

345
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,040
They are in love,

346
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,050
and I just stand there applauding?

347
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,680
Fine.

348
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,860
Watch the movie by yourself.

349
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,200
I need to go to my room and sleep.

350
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,880
I can't help falling asleep.

351
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,890
Don't. Don't. Don't

352
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,200
I... I...

353
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,550

How about my coming back at once?

375

a yacht license.

Or seaside resort?

383
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,160
I think this is also good.

384
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:12,960
But...

385
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,290
I let you sleep on the bed,

386
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:18,750
so can you answer

387
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,100
my questions seriously?

388
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,080
You didn't sleep all night.

389

Aren't you sleepy?

390

I didn't sleep

last night,

392
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,560
because I was thinking

393
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,280
about this thing.

394
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,660
We've been together

395
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,290
for almost six months.

396
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,430
It's not right to stay in the lab

397
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,270
every day, right?

398
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,190
So I'm thinking

399
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,990
how we can date

400
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,000

often eat, go shopping,

404
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,210
and watch movies during their date.

405
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,900
Isn't it exaggerated that you

406
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,750
get her on a yacht in the beginning?

407
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,360

409

530
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,640
Which one?

531

What?

532

It's not in the right shape.

535

Don't look at it.

536
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,400
Alright. I will stop.

537
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,210

and give it to you as a gift.

Well, thank you.

543

You are welcome.

The maze just now

547
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,940
is quite simple.

548
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,410
I just walk out of it without any effort.

549
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,930

552
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,010
the maze is hard?

553
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,770
I'm quite smart, OK?

554
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,760
Well,

555
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,500
don't be that serious.

556
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,150
We scientists

557

are just serious and accurate,

558
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,500
right?

559
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,430
The situation is like this.

560
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,400
What about your side?

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,620

00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,260

566

everything goes well.

567
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,830
However, we still need to be alert.

OK.

You didn't sleep for the whole night again?

You are transferring from one side to another.

It's so tiring.

584

Would you like to tell the truth to your father?

585
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,790
I don't have

any credit from my dad.

for being too comfortable in the past two years.

He didn't have formal birthdays

606

as he was abroad in the past years.

Now that he is back,

608
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,710
I think we should

609
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,680
show some warmth to him.

610
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,110
I will book a restaurant tonight.

No.

He doesn't need your warmth.

614
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,290
Alright.

615
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,950
Other processes should catch up.

616

Mine is almost done.

617
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,180

He has one for a long time.

621
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,710
It's Cui Jing in his lab.

622
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,550
Did he tell you that?

623
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,440
He doesn't

talk much.

625
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,490
How could he tell me that?

626

Of course I

701
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,610
and I'm not willing to teach him step by step,

702
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,370
I still

703
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,840
prepared a cake for him.

704
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:00,630
And put it

705
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,890
in the back of the car with some ice.

706
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,950
It's all I can do.

707
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,610
I...

708
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,790
This...this is mine.

709
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,750
Hello, Lingling.

710
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,690
I'm not coming back tonight.

711
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,190
I'll be here for Yang Lanhang's birthday.

712
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,260
They are spending the night there?

713
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,350
I have guessed it.

714
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,030
Great.

715
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,420
It's good to spend the night together.

716
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,210
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

717
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,500
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

718
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,320
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

719
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,550
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

720
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,900
Hold, hold on.

721
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,580
Today is my birthday.

722
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,920
You don't know it?

723
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:58,510
No, well.

724
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,430
Does Yifan prepare

725
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,960
this cake?

726
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,560
I should thank him for the reminder.

727
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,650
But luckily,

728
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,660
I have made it.

729
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,250
Hurry up.

730
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,170
Hurry up and make a wish.

731
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,890
Thank you.

732
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,110
OK.

733
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:11,990
Hurry.

734
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,960
I will make a wish.

735
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,790
I hope

736
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,050
our material

737
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,270
can go to the market as soon as possible.

738
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,660
So, Lingling's grandma

739
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,540
and other patients

740
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,710
who need it

741
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,270
can perform the operation

742
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,320
and become better.

743
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,170
The second wish.

744
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,430
I hope

745
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,000
people I love

746
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,630
can be safe

747
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,730
and healthy.

748
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,640
The third wish.

749
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,770
It's okay. You should stop now.

750
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,580
I know the third one.

751
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,550
It must be

752
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,760
being with me forever,

753
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,350
right?

754
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,230
Well,

755
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,200
you don't need to make a wish to candles.

756
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,170
You just need to make a wish to me.

757
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,780
Maybe I can help you realize it.

758
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:54,870
OK.

759
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,210
Don't waste your chance.

760
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,470
Hurry up and make another one.

761
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,320
I...

762
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,500
I really don't know what to make.

763
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,130
It's okay.

764
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,850
You just say it in your mind.

765
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,450
Bai Lingling be young forever.

766
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,590
Young forever.

767
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,410
Bai Lingling be young forever.

768
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:15,700
Right.

769
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,770
Young forever. Did you finish it?

770
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,230
Yes.

771
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,730
OK.

772
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,380
Happy birthday!

773
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,550
Happy birthday!

774
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,990
Thank you.

775
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,640
Actually, I haven't spent

776
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,690
a formal birthday for many years.

777
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,360
Your birthday

778
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,740
is important.

779
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,010
I will spend it with you

780
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,310
in the future, every of it.

781
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,570
OK.

782
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,920
We will spend

783
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,840
all the important

784
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,680
days together.

785
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,070
Like your birthday,

786
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,910
my birthday,

787
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,340
Christmas, Valentine

788
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,390
and New Year.

789
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,940
And Women's Day,

790
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,820
Labor Day

791
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,040
and Children's Day.

792
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,240
What is this?

793
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,430
I was so rushed today,

794
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,780
so I just fold

795
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,160
this for you,

796
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,170
Great.

797
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,260
Together with the cake,

798
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,530
it means you will start your voyage with blessings.

799
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,330
It even has a meaning.

800
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,810
If we meet any problems

801
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,790
in the future

802
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,290
that you feel difficult,

803
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,300
you can tear this up.

804
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,429
There is an answer in it.

805
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,620
There won't be such a day.

806
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,929
That's even better.

807
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,460
I hope you

808
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,270
never tear it up.

809
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,650
Because I spent much time folding it.

810
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:19,830
I won't.

811
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,520
Happy birthday.

812
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,070
Thank you.

813
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,389
Thank you for accepting me,

814
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,610
and forgiving me.

815
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,170
It's like a miracle

816
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,510
meeting you.

817
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,699
I'm so happy every day.

818
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,719
I should also thank you.

819
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,110
I'm so happy

820
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,830
every day with you, too.

821
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:53,389
I also think

822
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,110
you are my miracle

823
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,370
and my hope.

824
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,550
Right.

825
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,110
When

826
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,790
did you fall in love with me?

827
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,430
Honestly,

828
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,820
I don't know.

829
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,790
When I realized I did,

830
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,980
it had been a long time.

831
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,290
I need to confess a thing.

832
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,310
My favorite movie

833
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,280
is not Before Sunrise.

834
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,080
Well,

835
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,390
I tried to

836
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,920
find a topic to chat with you,

837
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,530
so I copied the note of Guan Xiaoyu.

838
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,250
Is there any chance that you like

839
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,920
After Dusk?

840
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,760
I never watched this.

841
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,700
Actually,

842
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,510
no matter it is dawn or dusk,

843
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,450
it is too short for me.

844
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,940
What I want is

845
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,040
every moment.

846
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,660
So, Yang Lanhang

847
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,500
doesn't know

848
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,670
it is his birthday today.

849
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,930
Lingling doesn't know, either.

850
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,620
And you tell me

851
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,750
they are spending the birthday together on the sea.

852
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,940
They are both smart.

853
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm sure they can find the clue soon.

854
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,210
Why don't you just tell them?

855
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,480
It would be less interesting.

856
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,950
It's a big misfortune

857
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,520
that Yang Lanhang

858
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,450
has a cousin

859
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
like you.

860
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,310
Ouyang,

861
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,790
my work is almost done.

862
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,220
I can go home after that.

863
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,830
Are you free tomorrow, Ouyang?

864
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:35,670
Yes.

865
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,700
Lingling said a

866
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,750
good fiction movie is newly on.

867
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,930
She intended to watch it with me.

868
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,370
And I have bought the tickets.

869
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,680
But she has something to do suddenly,

870
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,830
so I'm wondering if you would like...

871
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,710
OK.

872
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,290
OK.

873
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,520
OK.

874
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,960
I work for two companies at daytime.

875
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,220
Taking care of my dad's side

876
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,350
and managing the company for Yang.

877
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,490
He is dating his girlfriend

878
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,240
at night at home,

879
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:11,870
and I cannot go back

880
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,180
and almost sleep on the street.

881
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,480
Where can you find a better cousin?

882
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,980
What?

883
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,910
What misfortune?

884
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,590
It's a fortune,

885
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,220
OK?

886
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,130
When did you sleep on the street?

887
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,030
Didn't I save you?

888
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,290
Where are you now?

889
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,040
Saving me?

890
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,360
I just sleep on your couch.

891
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,740
You didn't even give me a blanket.

892
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,840
I almost got a cold.

893
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,560
Didn't I get you a blanket?

894
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,030
I...

895
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,380
OK.

896
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,370
Even if I didn't give you a blanket,

897
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,010
so what?

898
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:34,970
Don't you come from a wealthy family?

899
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,190
You can live at a hotel.

900
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,030
Why do you sleep at my place?

901
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,670
You don't have money, right? I invite you...

902
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,640
Strange...

903
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,480
to come to my house and you have so many complaints.

904
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,890
You even blame me for not giving you a blanket.

905
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,750
It's good enough to give you the couch,

906
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,900
OK?

907
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,400
Interesting.

908
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,240
You don't have money, right?

909
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,240
Take away all these money.

910
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,510
And give my bags back

911
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,600
starting from tomorrow.

912
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,470
Where does so much money come from?

913
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,520
I have lots of money.

914
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,450
I have saved it for long.

915
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,710
For long.

916
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,740
Why do you return 10 thousand yuan to me

917
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,010
at a time?

918
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,360
Ri, right.

919
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:14,910
Why?

920
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,010
I just don't want to

921
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,190
spend it at a time.

922
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,740
What?

923
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,370
No.

924
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,420
You just want to see me more.

925
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,980
No. You think too much.

926
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,820
Guan Xiaoyu,

927
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,460
it's not direct at all. It's not like you.

928
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,570
Who is indirect?

929
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,470
I need to tell you.

930
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:27,980
Don't pretend

931
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,150
to know me.

932
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,740
I...I...

933
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,710
Just go back

934
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,210
to your five-star hotel.

935
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,390
You liked me for a long time, right?

936
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,520
No. Who likes you?

937
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,360
You just like me.

938
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,960
Get away.

939
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,670
Why don't you admit it?

940
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,300
What should I admit?

941
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:37,680
I...

942
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,780
♫ Honey ♫

943
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,830
♫ I don't intend to be silent ♫

944
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,460
♫ Don't break the wall ♫

945
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,720
♫ I'm afraid ♫

946
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,800
♫ I will overthink after your glance ♫

947
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,620
♫ Actually ♫

948
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,630
♫ I have much more to say ♫

949
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,280
♫ Like the great weather ♫

950
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,180
♫ Or can we ♫

951
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,360
♫ Sit by the seaside? ♫

952
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,010
No way.

953
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,450
I...I will

954
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,920
change the password tomorrow.

955
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,270
Then,

956
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,630
what about now?

957
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,360
Call the

958
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,870
unblanking company now.

959
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,640
What time is it now?

960
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,110
They should be sleeping.

961
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,880
What about coming with me?

962
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,120
OK. Let's go.

963
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:00,750
Drag.

964
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,350
Don't touch me.

965
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,350
Let's go.

966
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,570
Where are we going?

967
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,390
Are we going to Yang Lanhang's house?

968
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:29,860
I'm just

969
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,030
living there temporarily.

970
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,260
It's not good to bring someone else.

971
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,480
Let's go to a hotel.

972
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,290
Hotel?

973
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,460
Right.

974
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,930
I will open a room for you

975
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,360
and you can spend the night there.

976
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,700
I will pick you up tomorrow morning

977
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,690
and find someone to open the door.

978
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,370
OK.

979
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,440
Go inside.

980
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,470
Right.

981
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:22,940
You should

982
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,340
take some responsibility for this.

983
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,550
It has nothing to do with me.

984
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,930
Call me with the phone

985
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,650
in the hotel after

986
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,440
you are awake tomorrow morning.

987
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,160
I will pick you up.

988
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,880
Dial one for my home.

989
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,760
Rest early. Goodnight.

990
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,600
Hello.

991
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,750
I just realize that

992
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,540
you should have

993
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,300
no clothes for change.

994
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,310
I have bought you some

995
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,570
from the store casually,

996
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,080
and have asked the waiter to put it at your door.

997
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,030
I got it.

998
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,370
Thank you.

999
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,280
Why didn't you

1000
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,240
push me away just now?

1001
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:09,780
Hello.
