[Episode 10]

4
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,100
Aren't you busy there?

5
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,180
My work is never done,

6
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,740
but you are more important than my work.

7
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,100
Don't you want to see me?

8
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,860
It's just a little sudden.

9
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,420
Not at all.

10
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,740
I‘ve thought about it over and over again.

11
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,980
Maybe I'm a little greedy after all.

12
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,860
Of course I hope

13
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,820
you can put aside all external factors

14
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,860
like education background and appearance

15
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,180
and only love my soul.

16
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,500
But I also hope that

17
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,180
you can accept all of me

18
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,660
besides my soul.

19
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,930
I hope you still like me

20
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,260
after you see me.

21
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,700
So when are you going back?

22
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,260
Provisionally, next week.

23
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,260
I'll let you know the exact date

24
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,420
in advance.

25
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,220
Next week is okay.

26
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,140
I still have some time to buffer myself.

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,140
Me too.

28
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,220
To be honest, I'm really nervous.

29
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,340
Yeah.

30
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,579
I'm nervous, too.

31
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,450
See you next week.

32
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,380
OK.

33
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,780
Interesting.

34
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,420
Now I think

35
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,820
your little boyfriend

36
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,899
is more adorable.

37
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,579
You bet.

38
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,459
Do you know that?

39
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,540
Most of the boys

40
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,140
in love put a lot of

41
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,060
emphasis on how much they pay out.

42
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,100
After doing some trivial things,

43
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
they are going to boast about themselves like,

44
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,980
'Look how nice I am to you!';

45
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,620
'How much I've done for you!';

46
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,420
''How much I love you!'

47
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,340
or 'How great I am!'

48
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,380
and so on,

49
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,380
which makes girls

50
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,220
feel guilty.

51
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,020
But look!

52
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,500
He didn't!

53
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,659
He insisted on explaining it to you

54
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,180
that it was all because of himself,

55
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,940
so you don't need to

56
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,140
feel guilty at all.

57
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,290
He's very protective

58
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,100
of your emotions.

59
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,940
And also,

60
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,060
he always shows you

61
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,260
a positive attitude

62
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,620
in your relationship.

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,260
That's what it means

64
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,620
to love someone.

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,900
He's always like this.

66
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,060
I've gotten used to it,

67
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,220
so I didn't pay much attention.

68
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,700
Well, if you put it that way,

69
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,540
I think there's something wrong with him.

70
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,620
The man could be a liar

71
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,660
if he talks

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,060
so skillfully.

73
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,460
Are you still suspicious of him?

74
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,260
I believe him.

75
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,620
I believe that he

76
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,340
can't be Ouyang Yifan.

77
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,220
But after all, it's online dating.

78
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,730
Listen to me carefully.

79
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
It's online dating anyway.

80
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,860
We can't be too cautious or prudent.

81
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,140
I see.

82
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,700
I don't care if he wants to

83
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,100
cheat my feelings,

84
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,540
as long as he doesn't cheat me out of my money.

85
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,260
You are quite broad-minded.

86
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,620
I'm serious.

87
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,500
Think about it.

88
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,740
It's commonplace that we modern people

89
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,850
fall in love and break up.

90
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,620
Well, you will be sad when you break up.

91
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,460
That's to say,

92
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,260
every time you're in a relationship,

93
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,690
there will be a risk of breaking up.

94
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,820
And it's a high risk.

95
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,620
You're gonna feel sad

96
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,780
no matter you fall in love,

97
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,860
break up or get cheated.

98
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,220
It's just kind of normal.

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,980
We shouldn't be bothered by

100
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,860
this kind of normal.

101
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,780
Right?

102
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,340
Breaks up with me and makes me sad,

103
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,180
never mind.

104
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,540
Cheat my money, no way.

105
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,220
Why?

106
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,780
I will not only be sad

107
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,020
but also be poor if he cheats on my money.

108
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,500
You are pretty rational.

109
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,220
But

110
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,980
money can't solve all the problems.

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
You should take me with you

112
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,020
next time you

113
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,220
meet him.

114
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,380
I should be your gatekeeper.

115
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,180
I don't need it!

116
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,980
I'm not a fool.

117
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,980
None of the girls are smart

118
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,860
when they are in love.

119
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
They all become fools.

120
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,060
Trust me.

121
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,620
OK. We'll talk about it later.

122
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,100
I haven't asked you,

123
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,940
what happened to you?

124
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,700
Didn't you go out early?

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,180
When did you come back?

126
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,140
And sleep in your clothes!

127
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,060
Where did you go?

128
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,620
Don't mention it.

129
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,890
What?

130
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,250
They are twins.

131
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,900
When did you...?

132
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,380
Are, are you pregnant?

133
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,940
What are you thinking!

134
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,100
I mean, twin brothers!

135
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,820
It's only....

136
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,780
You look quite....

137
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,260
And you've already know their gender?

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,260
Bai Lingling,

139
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,100
I mean Ouyang Yifan.

140
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,220
He has a twin brother!

141
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,380
Don't tell me that you

142
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,060
have seen my elder brother!

143
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,410
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,660
Don't you know that?

145
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,130
Didn't your mother tell you

146
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,180
that I have a twin brother

147
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,860
when you went that blind date?

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,860
I do have a brother.

149
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,380
Are you kidding me?

150
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,300
Think back to it.

151
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,060
Did he always answer you with

152
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,659
'Yes' or 'Huh'

153
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,570
no matter what you said?

154
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,300
I didn't expect that

155
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,620
he could not only help me get rid of

156
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,659
bad relationships

157
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,820
but also find my true love.

158
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
I love him so much!

159
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,820
You go away!

160
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
I don't want to see you anymore.

161
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,980
Go, go, go!

162
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,100
You are

163
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,220
such a ruthless woman!

164
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,740
I've saved you a couple of times.

165
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,940
Don't you feel grateful

166
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,820
to me?

167
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,500
You are ruthless!

168
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,700
Go away, quickly.

169
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,490
I don't want to see your face.

170
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,380
I hate you!

171
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,180
Why should I leave?

172
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,940
I rented this room.

173
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,940
I will sleep here.

174
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,460
You...!

175
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,059
Just like what I said,

176
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,450
you'll meet a ghost sooner or later

177
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,659
if you always walk too much at night.

178
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,860
Are they really twin brothers?

179
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,419
I've never seen

180
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,380
twin brothers in reality.

181
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,780
Do they look the same?

182
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,810
I found that they are not so similar

183
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,420
when I see their photos.

184
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,380
But I had never

185
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,500
thought of it.

186
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,060
Well, forget it.

187
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,210
Never mind.

188
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,900
He didn't do anything to you,

189
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,500
right?

190
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,020
But I'm still angry.

191
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,940
I feel angry when I think of this.

192
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,620
Look,

193
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,380
Panpan hasn't answered my phone call yet.

194
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,740
He must have been mad at me!

195
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,210
[Professor Jiang]

196
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,100
Hello, Professor.

197
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,340
Congratulations, Bai Lingling.

198
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,860
Your score on the preliminary exam is very high,

199
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,060
and your graduation thesis is also of high quality.

200
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,050
Thank you, professor.

201
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:26,930
Well,

202
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,660
I still keep your

203
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,540
undergraduate diploma.

204
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,820
Don't you want to take it back?

205
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,220
Of course I do!

206
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,540
I,

207
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,900
I really want it!

208
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,580
Look,

209
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,380
Professor, I...

210
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,180
took the exam

211
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,220
and meanwhile, rewrote my thesis.

212
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,220
I lived like I was dying.

213
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,010
How could I not want it back?

214
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,220
Don't say it like that.

215
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,660
You had a narrow escape from death.

216
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,580
Alright. Professor,

217
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,740
I think you didn't call me here

218
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,740
just to praise me.

219
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,140
Here is the thing.

220
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,410
As things should be,

221
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,540
it's three months away of the first day of school.

222
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,900
I ask you here today

223
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,380
because I want you to

224
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,940
choose your research project ahead of time.

225
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,220
You can start your research earlier

226
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,540
if you learn about it earlier.

227
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,780
Look.

228
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,660
Hi, Professor!

229
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,300
Hello.

230
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,060
This is the material

231
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,020
I want you to work on.

232
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,850
Metamaterials?

233
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,540
Yes.

234
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,500
Metamaterials

235
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,780
are composite materials

236
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,460
with artificially designed structures

237
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,740
that exhibit extraordinary

238
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,860
physical properties

239
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,100
not found in

240
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,100
natural materials.

241
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,090
A feasibility study was done

242
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,180
according to the research direction.

243
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,780
These plans were

244
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,740
initially formulated.

245
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,970
You can take it away

246
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,300
and read it carefully.

247
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,580
Search for some relevant information.

248
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,700
Okay.

249
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,620
No problem.

250
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,140
Are you free tomorrow?

251
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,700
Tomorrow? What for?

252
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,460
Please tell me.

253
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,580
Here's what happens.

254
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,740
Now we

255
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,460
have a physical experiment

256
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,380
on oxidation resistance.

257
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,420
Originally, Yu Shuang was in charge.

258
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,180
He is one of my

259
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,300
graduate students now.

260
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,380
But our school

261
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,740
has assigned him

262
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,290
to go to Shanghai with me

263
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,900
to attend a seminar tomorrow.

264
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,540
But

265
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,620
this experiment

266
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,740
can't be delayed anymore.

267
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,100
So....

268
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,540
Professor,

269
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,100
that's okay. I will handle it.

270
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,740
Don't be in such a rush to say yes.

271
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,420
This experiment is not difficult.

272
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,700
But

273
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,660
you need to go through

274
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,780
100 hours of standing by

275
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,100
the device continuously

276
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,300
in case something goes wrong.

277
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,380
Professor,

278
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,140
do you know that

279
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,420
I slept less than ten hours a week

280
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,580
when I prepared for the postgraduate entrance exam.

281
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,180
This....

282
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,170
Just tell me

283
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,140
how to do it.

284
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,620
Sure.

285
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,210
He'll be back

286
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,060
the day after tomorrow at the latest.

287
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
All you have to do is

288
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,780
keep an eye on it for the first 30 hours.

289
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,580
No problem.

290
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,410
Alright. Deal?

291
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:41,980
That's it.

292
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,500
Deal.

293
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,140
We count on you.

294
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,850
Goodbye, Professor.

295
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,190
OK.

296
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,220
Are you really going to

297
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,940
that old lab?

298
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,980
Do you still remember

299
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,300
the story of the old lab

300
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,140
that we knew when we first entered our university?

301
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,740
Aren't you scared?

302
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,540
Why should I be scared?

303
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,940
We scientific researchers

304
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,940
are staunch materialists

305
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,820
who are not afraid of these rumors.

306
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,260
Where are you going?

307
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,420
I have to go to a planning meeting first.

308
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,380
And then

309
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,060
I should go to school and find Geng Panpan.

310
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,020
I need to invite him to dinner to apologize.

311
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,580
Who knows if Ouyang Yifan

312
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,370
had bullied him!

313
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,500
He's been acting with me

314
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,500
for more than half a year.

315
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,980
We are friends of life and death.

316
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,860
I would never

317
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,780
burn my Bridges.

318
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,050
Please come in.

319
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,900
You are here.

320
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,580
Hello.

321
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,300
Hello. Sit down and wait for a while.

322
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:42,860
OK.

323
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,220
Hi.

324
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,060
Excuse me,

325
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,780
I wanna ask,

326
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,620
could you please

327
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,860
call Geng Panpan in 302 for me?

328
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,140
OK. Wait a second.

329
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,980
Sure. Thank you.

330
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,500
Thank you....

331
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,820
I'm the roommate of Geng Panpan.

332
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,580
Are you Guan Xiaoyu?

333
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,620
Yes.

334
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,780
Where is he?

335
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,740
I called him,

336
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,540
but he didn't answer.

337
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,610
He, he is in hospital.

338
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,220
Hospital?

339
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,470
[Xiaoxiao]

340
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,740
Hello, Panpan.

341
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,860
I'm outside your dormitory right now.

342
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,820
Your roommate told me that you are in hospital.

343
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,860
What happened?

344
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,220
Which hospital? I'll go visit you.

345
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,460
That's OK.

346
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,700
I, I'm fine.

347
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,460
Are you mad at me?

348
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm sorry.

349
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,860
I drank too much yesterday.

350
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,540
I didn't know

351
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,420
I was drinking spirits.

352
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,060
What the hell happened to you?

353
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,260
I'm not mad.

354
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,620
I didn't tell you because I don't want you to worry about me.

355
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,730
I'm fine, really.

356
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,300
Just mild concussion.

357
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,620
The doctor said I'd be

358
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,340
discharged in a few days.

359
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,820
Concussion?

360
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
That's too awful!

361
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,420
What happened to you?

362
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,290
Why did you have concussion?

363
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,620
Was it Ouyang Yifan?

364
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,500
I'll seek revenge on him.

365
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,140
No, no.

366
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,300
No.

367
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,100
I went to the bar

368
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,940
to look for you that night

369
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,620
when I saw that

370
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,020
Ouyang Yifan was going away with you.

371
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,660
I ran out in a hurry,

372
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,380
but was knocked down

373
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,420
by a reversing car

374
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,140
in an unguarded moment.

375
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,660
I fell on the ground

376
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,090
and got hit on my head.

377
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,220
Are you an idiot?

378
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,860
Why were you so careless?

379
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,460
I was afraid something would happen to you.

380
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
So I didn't think that much.

381
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,020
What would happen to me!

382
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,660
He dare not do anything evil to me.

383
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,660
Tell me.

384
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,780
Which hospital are you in?

385
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,940
You really don't need to come.

386
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,980
I'm a little tired.

387
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,010
Then I'll hang up.

388
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,410
Listen,

389
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,300
I'm magnanimous.

390
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,060
You may rest assured.

391
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,380
I told you that we are friends,

392
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,460
then we'll be friends forever.

393
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,460
Come on,

394
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,580
I'll drink it for worship.

395
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,700
You can't drink any more, right?

396
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,180
I'll help you.

397
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,900
All right. You've drunk too much.

398
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,570
I'll send you home.

399
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,410
No!

400
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,660
Bartender!

401
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,180
One more glass!

402
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,580
Quickly!

403
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,340
Go, go. Let's go home.

404
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,060
One more glass.

405
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,580
Another bar, okay?

406
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:42,940
Go.

407
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,330
Why are you so heavy!

408
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,540
Me?

409
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,340
Where are you taking her?

410
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,500
She's drunk. I'll send her home.

411
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,700
Let me send her home.

412
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,100
Imp,

413
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,370
I know

414
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,420
what you are thinking.

415
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,140
Get out of the way.

416
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,260
I'm her boyfriend.

417
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,540
I'll send her home.

418
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,900
You're addicted to acting!

419
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:04,940
OK.

420
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,300
Just ask her

421
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,380
whether she'd like to go with you.

422
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,500
Xiaoxiao,

423
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm Panpan.

424
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,980
Let me send you home.

425
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,100
You're finally here.

426
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,660
You know what?

427
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,460
You

428
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,620
are my best,

429
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,660
best friend.

430
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,620
Best friend.

431
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,420
You.

432
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,820
Let's go.

433
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,340
See?

434
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Drink more.

435
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,990
[Gate of Heart]

436
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,700
[Forever is for Ever]

437
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,339
Are you tired?

438
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,859
No. I already have some preparation.

439
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,940
Well.

440
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,660
You scared me!

441
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,860
You scared me!

442
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,540
Why are you laughing

443
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,700
at 3:30 a.m.?

444
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,820
What are you doing?

445
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,460
I am spending time with my girlfriend

446
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,380
on her experiment.

447
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,580
Aren't you cooking?

448
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm cooking.

449
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:05,900
But my girlfriend

450
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,020
is in the lab right now.

451
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,340
This is the first time

452
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,300
she's performed an experiment alone.

453
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,410
I'm a little worried about her,

454
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,290
so I want to accompany her remotely.

455
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,740
You can go to the lab

456
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,900
if you worry about her.

457
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,260
You are her

458
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,580
senior fellow apprentice.

459
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,640
That's reasonable for you to see her.

460
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,810
I can't.

461
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,460
Then you can chat with her.

462
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,500
I can't.

463
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,780
You can't do this,

464
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,690
and that.

465
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,060
Just cooking?

466
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,860
Hang,

467
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,660
I think you should confess.

468
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,060
It'll be good if you can go on with your relationship.

469
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,180
If you can't,

470
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,300
just turn to another one.

471
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,620
You stay up so late every day.

472
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,260
I'm worried about your health.

473
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,540
I see.

474
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,140
As a man who likes her,

475
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,420
I worry about her and

476
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,700
I'm afraid that she'd be too tired.

477
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,780
And I even want to

478
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,780
help her complete the experiments.

479
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,300
But as a qualified researcher,

480
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,140
I know that

481
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,900
she must go through

482
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,140
this process by herself.

483
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,180
Every one of us should

484
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,180
go through the process by ourselves.

485
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,500
Some of these experiments

486
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,250
take 30 hours,

487
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,890
and some 50 hours,

488
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,340
or even 100 hours.

489
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,460
When I was in Europe,

490
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,140
I saw one of my friends spend

491
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,020
10,000 hours on anti oxidation.

492
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
The sadness

493
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,380
and loneliness

494
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,020
can only be digested by herself.

495
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,300
All we can do is

496
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,580
wait for her at the finish line.

497
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,810
If she can't even

498
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,020
get through these 30 hours,

499
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,260
it would be hard for her

500
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
to really understand this occupation.

501
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,660
It was also her first lesson

502
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,860
from Professor Jiang.

503
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540
What if

504
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,260
she can't understand your thoughts?

505
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,300
Couldn't you

506
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,250
give her some hints

507
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,500
privately?

508
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,740
No.

509
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,860
What I should do

510
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,580
is to wait for her at the finish line

511
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,900
and prepare some small surprises

512
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,060
for her.

513
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,940
I suspect you are not 26

514
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,860
You are 62 instead.

515
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,380
Nonsense.

516
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,700
Well, I won't go to sleep.

517
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,210
You can sleep in my bed.

518
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,380
OK.

519
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,500
Come on.

520
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,620
Don't come over!

521
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,660
Don't come over!

522
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,420
I could tell her that it's professor

523
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,100
asked me to bring her some food.

524
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,340
Bai Lingling.

525
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,900
Bai Lingling.

526
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,690
Stay there.

527
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,220
Stay there.

528
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:28,820
Stay there.

529
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,020
Slow down. Slow down.

530
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,300
Go back. Go back.

531
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,340
Hold the railing.

532
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,020
Keep down. Keep down.

533
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,460
Alright. Wait for me.

534
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,900
You can tell me if you stay here overnight.

535
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,020
I didn't know you were inside

536
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,500
when I locked the gate.

537
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,500
I'm sorry.

538
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,860
I would be more careful later.

539
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,620
Thank you, sir.

540
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,420
It's okay.

541
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,660
Are you okay?

542
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,820
I didn't jump yet.

543
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,580
Then why did you climb over the railing?

544
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,540
I thought you were going to

545
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,260
jump down.

546
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,380
If I was committing suicide,

547
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,340
why would I choose the second floor?

548
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,020
So why did you stay there?

549
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,940
I was performing an experiment.

550
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,260
It would take me 30 hours.

551
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,140
And I haven't finished it yet.

552
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,060
30 hours?

553
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,100
No chat anymore.

554
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,620
I need to

555
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,570
buy some rat poison.

556
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,820
Rat poison?

557
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,660
Aren't you in Shenzhen?

558
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,980
Why are you back?

559
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,820
A venture capital firm

560
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,500
is interested in our products.

561
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,340
So we made an appointment this noon.

562
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,490
I'm afraid I would be late to take the early flight.

563
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,940
So I took a high-speed train last night.

564
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,580
See, is this a chance

565
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,500
god offers me?

566
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,620
He asked me here to rescue a beauty.

567
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,660
Forget it.

568
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,380
What about accepting me?

569
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,370
No. No. No.

570
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,020
You...if you are

571
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,620
still here tonight,

572
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,700
I might invite you for dinner.

573
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,820
If you invite me for dinner,

574
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,620
I can stay here.

575
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,540
I can leave tomorrow.

576
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,340
Men should focus on their business.

577
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:01,940
Okay?

578
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,020
Focus on your business.

579
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,540
Just a meal.

580
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,970
Rat poison and mouse-trap.

581
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,850
Almost there.

582
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,660
Yang Lanhang.

583
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,140
I'm done.

584
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,140
I'm done. I'm done.

585
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,210
Yang,

586
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,580
why are you here?

587
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,970
You haven't had breakfast yet?

588
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,500
I didn't eat, either.

589
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,620
It looks quite delicious.

590
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,220
Can I have one?

591
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,300
Yang, what about going back?

592
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,580
I can handle these.

593
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,020
Yang, I was wrong.

594
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,060
I know I should not

595
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,380
leave the lab.

596
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,450
But...I have just been absent

597
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,540
for a little while.

598
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,060
I...I was going to buy

599
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,780
some rat poison.

600
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,220
There is a rat in the lab.

601
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,300
It's no more than one hour.

602
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,780
Yang, I was wrong.

603
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,300
I'm sure

604
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,780
I won't make it again.

605
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,980
Only for your absence

606
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,220
during the experimentation?

607
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,860
And I should not play the trick

608
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,540
to install a camera here.

609
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,890
Yang,

610
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,340
I know I was wrong.

611
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,540
You won't tell Professor Jiang, will you?

612
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,620
It's so hard for me to join you.

613
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,260
I'm afraid that the professor would kick me out

614
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,700
if he knows that.

615
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,140
So, ever since your stepping in,

616
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,810
you haven't asked me

617
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,180
if the experiment is okay.

618
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,320
You are here anyway.

619
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,710
What problem could there be?

620
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,780
So,

621
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,570
compared with

622
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,580
your master's degree,

623
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,460
your satisfying report cards

624
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,180
and your promising future,

625
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,980
this experiment

626
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,940
matters nothing, right?

627
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,940
I...I put a camera....

628
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,540
Bai Lingling,

629
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,130
why on earth do you

630
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,140
pursue a master's degree?

631
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,490
To become better, of course.

632
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,420
And then?

633
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,980
To have a satisfying resume

634
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,740
and gain higher income?

635
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,740
Right?

636
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
So is there anything wrong with it?

637
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:10,940
No.

638
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,700
There's nothing wrong.

639
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,180
What's wrong with him?

640
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,140
Why is he mad at me

641
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,820
in the early morning?

642
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,380
And he wasted food.

643
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,220
I'm down.

644
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,410
I sneaked away in the experimentation

645
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,220
and was actually caught by Yang Lanhang.

646
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,940
We have agreed to turn the page.

647
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,700
But I don't know how

648
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,780
I have offended him again.

649
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,130
I just don't know why.

650
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
It's not his experiment anyway.

651
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,980
Why was he so angry?

652
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
It seems that

653
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,780
I can't make friends with him anyhow.

654
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,100
Do you think

655
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,820
he'll tell this

656
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,780
to the professor?

657
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,640
[Off]

658
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,140
I'm back, Lingling.

659
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,140
Good job.

660
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
Is there anything wrong with it?

661
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,020
No. Everything goes well.

662
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,300
Here. This is the record.

663
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,500
That's great.

664
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,900
This means a lot to me.

665
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,100
It's late.

666
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,450
Hurry home and have a good rest.

667
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:20,930
Okay.

668
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,220
Yu,

669
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,100
emm...

670
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,980
Has the professor told you something?

671
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,060
No.

672
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,330
Then,

673
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,780
I just want to know

674
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,460
if

675
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,420
there's been someone like me

676
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,540
that has passed the reexamine

677
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,900
but was still refused

678
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,980
before?

679
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,900
Usually,

680
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,980
no.

681
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,940
But it was by no means zero.

682
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,580
Hold on.

683
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,060
Why are you here?

684
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,580
Didn't you say that you'd like to invite me for dinner?

685
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,420
You forgot?

686
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,130
I kept the bill anyway.

687
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,860
Remember to pay me.

688
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,260
I see.

689
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,340
Alright, you've sent them here.

690
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,340
Why don't you leave?

691
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,380
It's enough that you refused me.

692
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,260
You needn't be so ruthless, need you?

693
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,770
Just kidding. Eat together.

694
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
Why is a boy here?

695
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,420
Come on. Ask him out.

696
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,530
I haven't made up yet.

697
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
It's me.

698
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,860
Zheng Minghao.

699
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,300
It's you.

700
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,020
Why not tell me earlier?

701
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,540
What will we eat?

702
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,940
Could you two please

703
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
show me some respect?

704
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,220
Sauerkraut fish?

705
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,580
You bought it?

706
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,060
Great. I like Sauerkraut fish best.

707
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,220
Nice. Nice.

708
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
You two, don't eat.

709
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,780
I'll go brush my teeth.

710
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,780
Don't eat. Wait for me.

711
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,700
Okay. Okay.

712
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,340
-Thanks. 
-Go. Go. Go.

713
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,620
What happened yesterday?

714
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,420
Nothing special.

715
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,180
Yesterday, after the experiment,

716
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,740
I wanted to go out.

717
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,020
But the gate was locked.

718
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,060
I was so nervous that

719
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,450
I was about to jump from the second floor.

720
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,740
Luckily, Minghao arrived.

721
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,940
Jump from the second floor? Are you crazy?

722
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,140
Am I brave?

723
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,540
Are all experiments

724
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,740
so tiring?

725
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,450
It actually needs

726
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,340
more than 30 hours.

727
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,170
30 hours is normal.

728
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,300
Some might need 100 hours.

729
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,380
And I was just

730
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,370
helping monitor that.

731
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
So tiring.

732
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,660
How could you girls

733
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,730
get so tired?

734
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,180
He's right.

735
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,100
Girls will soon look old

736
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,180
if they stay up late so often.

737
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,740
You'll easily get wrinkles.

738
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,140
Look at Yang Lanhang.

739
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,730
Although he is in his twenties,

740
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,700
he looks like

741
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,300
a middle-aged man.

742
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,140
Am I right?

743
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,420
Do you even want to

744
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,540
have a date with a middle-aged man?

745
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,580
I was drunk at that time.

746
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,140
Alright. Alright.

747
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,100
I was finally able to pursue a master's degree,

748
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,620
right?

749
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,540
I can't quit midway

750
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,380
and resign.

751
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,060
It's normal in this field.

752
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,740
Why not?

753
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,340
What should I do if I quit?

754
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,500
Live on air?

755
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,860
I can support you.

756
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,420
No.

757
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,380
I was saying...

758
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,500
Have you thought of

759
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,660
the Zhenghong Group?

760
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,780
What do you mean?

761
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,900
Owed by the Zhenghong Group,

762
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,090
a newly developed company

763
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,860
running electronic materials

764
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,780
is advertising

765
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,060
for staff.

766
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,980
I happened to see the advertisement

767
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,340
and thought of her.

768
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,460
So I asked that.

769
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,300
No.

770
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,270
I finally passed the exam.

771
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,340
I should strive to

772
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,170
get a master's degree anyway

773
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,180
even though it is hard.

774
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,860
But you should also think over

775
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,370
why you chose to

776
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
pursue a master's degree.

777
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:34,920
Bai Lingling,

778
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,540
why on earth did you

779
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,300
strive to be

780
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,460
a post graduate student?

781
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,340
It must be easier for a graduate student

782
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,980
to find a good job than a bachelor.

783
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,770
You're right.

784
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,450
The reason why I supported you to

785
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,860
pursue a master's degree is to

786
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,060
wish you more choices.

787
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,060
And now, you have a choice.

788
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,700
Don't you go?

789
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,180
It makes sense.

790
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:58,980
Lingling,

791
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,460
think of those rich guys.

792
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,900
For example, Bill Gates

793
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,890
and Jobs,

794
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,300
both of them dropped out

795
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,100
after gaining admission to their universities.

796
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,220
Alright. Alright.

797
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,250
I'll think it over.

798
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:10,900
Let's eat first.

799
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:11,700
Eat first.

800
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,610
That...

801
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,180
Minghao,

802
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,750
thank you.

803
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,050
Are you busy these days?

804
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,730
I have an important deed

805
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,140
to discuss with you.

806
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,860
Don't be upset.

807
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,540
Have some snacks.

808
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,460
Come on. Have one. Have one.

809
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,380
Cheer up. Cheer up.

810
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,380
Bite me.

811
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,780
I agree with Zheng Minghao.

812
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,780
You are anxious to work.

813
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,300
Isn't that you want to earn money

814
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,100
and create a better life for yourself

815
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,210
and your grandma?

816
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,620
If you choose the master's degree,

817
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,180
though your effort for the last half year

818
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,020
has paid off,

819
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,420
I think it is not worthwhile.

820
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,340
It still takes another few years.

821
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,020
What if you can't find

822
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,970
such a good job anymore

823
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,300
when you graduate?

824
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,500
It is a big loss.

825
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,940
What's more,

826
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,540
microelectronic material

827
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,100
is somehow similar to

828
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,580
your major, right?

829
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,260
I have no idea.

830
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,060
But I think the Zhenghong Group

831
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,380
is a really good choice.

832
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,260
If you join them now,

833
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,570
you will be a founding member.

834
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,900
And when this group

835
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,260
developed,

836
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,980
you might be a millionaire.

837
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,940
Bai Lingling,

838
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,300
only imagination is enough to excite me.

839
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,980
When you become a millionaire,

840
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,060
don't forget to support me.

841
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,300
I might have to think twice.

842
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,700
You're so heartless.

843
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,370
It really bothers me.

844
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,860
Look at my boyfriend.

845
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,180
What happened to him?

846
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,100
I've sent a lot of messages to him.

847
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,580
But he has disappeared for two days.

848
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,260
He totally ignored me.

849
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,820
I was still thinking about

850
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,460
asking for his advice.

851
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,100
So what I said just now

852
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,220
is no advice.

853
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,130
Yes. Yes. Yes.

854
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,210
Great advice for me.

855
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,460
I suddenly got

856
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,820
a great job offer.

857
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,180
I am somehow hesitant.

858
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,260
If I choose it,

859
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,460
I might have to quit pursuing a master's degree.

860
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,460
I need your advice.

861
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,860
Don't forget to reply when you see it.

862
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,940
Alright, leave him alone.

863
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,300
Have some drink?

864
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,240
Okay.

865
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,060
I won.

866
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,180
Go, go, go. Go fetch it.

867
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,970
You should admit defeat.

868
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,140
What type do we have?

869
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,260
Let me see.

870
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,820
Lemon,

871
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,420
passion fruit....

872
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,370
Passion fruit! Passion fruit!

873
