Do you want to come with me

353
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,060
and wash your face at my place?

354

[Nursing Assistant]

355
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,740
Hello.

356
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,380
I'm a patient

357
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,180
and I need nutrition.

358
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
What's this?

359
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,180
Is this for human?

360
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,130
Granny Wu,

361
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,100
this is...

362
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,860
Who is granny?

363
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,420
Do I look that old?

364
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,340
Sis.. Sister.

365
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,180
This was

366
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,220
paired by

367
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,340
a professional nutritionist.

368
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,460
There are vegetables and meat, and it's well balanced in nutrition.

369
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,530
Look,

370
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,180
other patients have the same food as yours.

371
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,460
Others are others.

372
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm not one of the others.

373
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,620
I'm telling you,

374
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,460
my family

375
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,930
is rich.

376
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,940
We even use chicken soup

377
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,780
to cook eggplants,

378
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,540
stewing with soft fire.

379
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,420
Look at this,

380
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,700
it's for beggars.

381
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,100
Take it away.

382
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm not eating it.

383
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,940
Wu Chunhua,

384
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,260
what are you doing?

385
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,540
That's enough.

386
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,820
Miss Hu, I'm sorry

387
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,460
that

388
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,660
she caused you trouble again.

389
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,740
Take it away.

390
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,260
See?

391
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,580
I never touched it.

392
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,290
Don't charge me for it.

393
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,220
Thanks.

394
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,460
Take it away, sorry.

395
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,300
I'm done here.

396
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,940
Thanks.

397
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,700
Sorry.

398
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,820
Look at me,

399
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,740
Wu Chunhua.

400
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,140
Alright.

401
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,420
Well,

402
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,380
what are you thinking?

403
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,380
Do you have to

404
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,100
call me over

405
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,580
just for this?

406
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,620
Is this not serious enough?

407
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,140
I asked them about the food.

408
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,420
It costs as much as 50 yuan a day.

409
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
I just can't eat it.

410
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,740
50 yuan a day.

411
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,380
It costs 1,500 yuan a month

412
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,460
just for meals.

413
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,250
This is crazy.

414
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,780
You should cancel the meals and get a refund.

415
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,860
So be it.

416
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,300
What will you eat if I cancel the meals?

417
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,580
You can't just eat

418
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,300
steamed buns here every day.

419
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,100
My steamed buns

420
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,300
are delicious

421
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,700
with this eggplant sauce.

422
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,140
You need to taste it, come on.

423
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,579
I don't want to.

424
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,339
Try it, just one bite.

425
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:07,940
I don't want to.

426
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,460
So ungrateful.

427
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:11,700
OK.

428
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,220
Let's see what else do I have.

429
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,770
Look at this.

430
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,500
Do you want it?

431
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,290
Where did you

432
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,900
get this?

433
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:22,660
You just asked the nurse to

434
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,940
take away your meal.

435
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,180
Where did you get this drumstick?

436
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,099
I exchanged my eggplant sauce for it.

437
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,260
I know you love meat.

438
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,740
Look at you,

439
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,500
with your internship stuff and graduation exams,

440
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,620
you are skinny now.

441
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
Try this.

442
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,740
No.

443
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,700
I don't believe

444
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,140
that someone would want your eggplant sauce.

445
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,740
So ungrateful.

446
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,860
Forget about it.

447
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,380
I'll save it as my midnight snack.

448
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,620
You are really noisy.

449
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,900
Don't mind her.

450
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,820
You shouldn't eat these things day after day.

451
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,820
I still got things to do at the university,

452
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,020
so I have to go now.

453
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,090
Call me

454
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,820
if you need anything.

455
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,140
Everything will be fine.

456
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,420
Anyway,

457
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,580
I will go home

458
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,940
in several days.

459
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,900
What are you talking about?

460
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,250
You can't go back.

461
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,730
Why not?

462
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,980
I'll be sick staying here even if I'm not.

463
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,620
You can't go home now.

464
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm telling you.

465
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,460
I found an expert

466
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,780
specializing in heart diseases through the Internet,

467
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,460
and I made an appointment for you.

468
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,300
You should go

469
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,260
and then

470
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,140
you can go home.

471
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,940
I'm afraid you are thinking too much.

472
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,020
Relax.

473
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,780
I'm tough.

474
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,140
I will not leave you alone

475
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,850
like your mother did.

476
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,700
You are talking nonsense.

477
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,740
I'm going to the restroom

478
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,300
and I'll talk to you when I'm back.

479
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,420
Awesome.

480
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,680
Don't clamp me.

486
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,180
In this cartoon,

487
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,980
every character

488
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,860
has a bunch of

489
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,570
partners

490
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,380
or friends.

491
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,930
So I...

492
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,620
I want to make a friend.

493
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,500
Good.

494
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,500
You should have thought about this earlier.

495
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,620
Don't be like your father,

496
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,020
staying in the lab all day long

497
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,580
and becoming numb.

498
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,100
You should go out

499
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,580
with your friends when you're not busy,

500
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,900
chatting, eating,

501
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,370
drinking, or watching movies.

502
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,620
This is how a relationship

503
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,890
is established.

504
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,100
Right?

505
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:08,940
OK.

506
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,340
The key

507
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,340
is your heart.

508
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,820
You need to open your heart.

509
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,020
I understand.

510
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,130
What?!

511

She failed the thesis defense.

512

No wonder she looked

513
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,940
so sad today.

514
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,940
Why?

515
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Do you know why?

516
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:29,980
Who?

517
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,980
Tell me his name.

518
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,780
I'll check

519
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,260
his background

520
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,580
to see if he's really something and ...

521
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,500
My god.

Yang Lanhang.

524
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,260
Really?

525
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,180

and has received so many awards.

529
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,620
He is a total genius...

530
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,220
You are back.

531
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,540
What are you doing?

532
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,980
Nothing. I was talking about the weather.

533
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,820
Are you OK?

534
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,060
I'm fine.

535
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
What could possibly go wrong.

536
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,500
So...

537
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,860
How about your thesis defense?

538
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,540
I know it.

539
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,100
I know I'm kind of

540
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,850
influential

541
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,100
in this university.

542
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,460
You all know what happened

543
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,100
so quickly.

544
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,660
So what are you

545
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,940
going to do next?

546
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Your grandmother is here

547
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,740
and it will cost you much in the nursing home.

548
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,500
If you can't obtain the graduation certificate,

549
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
it will be difficult to become a regular employee from your internship.

550
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,740
You have worked overnight

551
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,500
for one month,

552
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,290
and your body is worn out.

553
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,340
You can't give it up.

554
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,580
I'm thinking

555
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,820
I will wait for Mr. Jiang

556
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,820
tomorrow morning,

557
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,580
and I will beg him

558
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,820
with my sincere words and feelings

559
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,100
to see if

560
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,660
he will make an exception.

561
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,220
If he says no,

562
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,980
my internship will really be all for nothing.

563
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,900
It won't.

564
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,220
I think it will work.

565
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,700
Do you have any money left on you?

566
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,170
I'm telling you,

567
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,900
I've sold many novels lately.

568
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,100
I've made much money.

569
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,940
You know

570
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,780
how easy it is to spend money for me.

571
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,180
How about leaving them at your place?

572
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,900
Guan Xiaoyu.

573
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,900
I'm telling you,

574
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,580
if you make money,

575
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,020
I'm happy and proud of you.

576
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Keep them to yourself.

577
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,140
Why are you giving me?

578
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,100
Rest assured.

579
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,380
I have money.

580
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,500
Really?

581
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,660
I don't believe it, let me check.

582
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,100
Let me check.

583
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,140
Why do I lie? Unbelievable.

584
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,740
So much money.

585
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,460
What an age to keep money as cash?

586
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,180
But having money is good enough.

587
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,860
Having money is good enough.

588
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,860
Having money is a relief.

589
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,260
Lingling.

590
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,160
[Holding flowers]

591
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,500
Beauty,

592
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,860
my phone is out of battery.

593
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:31,860
Can I borrow your phone

594
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,540
to make a phone call?

595
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,860
Want to go for a ride?

596
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,780
This car is not mine.

597
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,850
That car is mine.

598
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,730
Hop in.

599
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,900
How about it?

600
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,220
Nice.

601
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,180
See, there's fish.

602
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,540
Look at this.

603
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,660
It's us!

604
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,620
Nice, right?

605
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,540
Do you have a crush on me?

606
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,860
Why do you make a doll of me?

607
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,210
What are you talking about?

608
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,270
This is the house

609
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,940
you rented for your creation.

610
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,050
Why do you spend so much money

611
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,500
to renovate?

612
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,540
This will be

613
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,060
our house.

614
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,820
But my mom only gave me the down payment.

615
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,810
I still have to

616
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,860
pay the loan every month.

617
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,220
But let me show you

618
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,820
a surprise.

619
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,420
Our...

620
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,100
Come.

621
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,460
Look, what do you think?

622
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,540
Come.

623
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,100
And this one.

624
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,220
What do you think?

625
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,060
This is your room.

626
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,500
Wait a minute, Guan Xiaoyu.

627
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,730
Our house?

628
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,540
My room?

629
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,500
What are you talking about?

630
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,500
We are graduating, aren't we?

631
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,220
We are moving out of the dormitory.

632
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,170
Instead of renting someone else's house,

633
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,380
you can rent mine,

634
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,300
and help me share a little bit of the rent.

635
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,660
OK?

636
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,340
Rest assured.

637
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,660
I will give you a discount.

638
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,660
Guan Xiaoyu,

639
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,530
whatever you say,

640
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,260
I know that

641
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,100
you’re just trying to make me feel good about

642
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,540
taking advantage of you.

643
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,460
Let me tell you something.

644
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,340
I'm out.

645
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,980
Don't say no just yet.

646
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,180
My house is really great.

647
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,820
You are so good at cooking.

648
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,810
I can still

649
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,180
eat and drink with you.

650
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,740
I’m happy just thinking about it.

651
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,580
I don't want to live alone.

652
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,660
I’m afraid of the darkness at night. Live with me.

653
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,260
Don't.

654
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,100
OK.

655
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,100
Don’t be a baby about it.

656
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:39,900
Let me ask you something.

657
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,180
How much is the loan

658
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,060
each month?

659
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,500
For real,

660
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,740
with the relationship we have,

661
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,980
you have to talk about money with me.

662
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,420
You are being a drama queen.

663
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,250
You're going to stay here.

664
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,420
How about this.

665
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,700
You pay for the water and electricity bill.

666
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,180
OK?

667
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,020
And

668
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,460
if someone is at the door,

669
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,540
you have to open it for me.

670
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,380
You will become

671
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,650
the first human shield

672
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,500
to keep back my many suitors.

673
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,580
What are you talking about?

674
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,020
No.

675
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,020
I will give you 2000 yuan.

676
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,100
That will make me satisfied.

677
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,820
That's it.

678
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,620
That's it, I'm so happy.

679
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,020
OK, that's a deal.

680
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,380
Let's go back to the dorm.

681
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,420
Let's move today.

682
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,380
Today?

683
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,060
I'm afraid that you would change your mind.

684
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,980
Let's move now.

685
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,340
Let me tell you,

686
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,130
you’re certainly up to no good with me.

687
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,900
No.

688
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,340
Well,

689
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,220
I will go change first.

690
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,660
I have been wearing this for the entire day.

691
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,380
That's a deal.

692
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,420
Go.

693
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,100
Thank you.

694
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,380
Love you.

695
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,890
I will go change first.

696
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,140
Go.

697
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,060
I'll go change, don't go.

698
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,940
Wait here for me.

699
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,090
Don't run around.

700
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,380
Wait for me.

701
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,300
Be right back.

702
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,620
Hello, please enjoy.

703
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,780
Thank you.

704
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,580
Oh right.

705
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,940
For real?

706
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:58,980
For real.

707
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
I wish

708
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,810
this had happened a little earlier.

709
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,460
A girl that pretty

710
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,170
slipped right out of my hand.

711
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,260
What are you talking about?

712
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:19,900
Nothing.

713
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,460
You know.

714
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Aunt called me

715
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,370
for half an hour today.

716
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,980
She made thousands of requirements.

717
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,060
Saying that you are in bad shape.

718
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,900
And you had a long flight.

719
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,220
Let me take good care of you.

720
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,570
Have some more of this.

721
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,700
She knows that we are meeting?

722
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,180
Didn't she suggest you

723
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,260
to tag along?

724
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,300
Yes.

725
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,100
I pretended not to hear it.

726
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,020
Did you bring

727
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,780
what I asked you to bring?

728
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,500
Here.

729
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,380
Business license.

730
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,060
Contract Seal, official seal, corporate seal.

731
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,100
And a receipt.

732
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,700
They are all here.

733
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,540
And there is also

734
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,340
a transfer order list.

735
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,500
So you can count and store things

736
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,510
on your way back.

737
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,990
[Business License]

738
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,050
Let me show you something else.

739
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,190
Look.

740
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,580
This is the work place

741
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,250
I found for you.

742
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,350
Look at the environment.

743
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,530
This stair.

744
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,120
Doesn’t it have texture

745
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,260
and elegance?

746
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,610
No need to show me.

747
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,440
If you like it, then that's fine.

748
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,130
No.

749
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,430
It's your working place.

750
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,190
You have to take a look.

751
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:20,650
No.

752
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,070
Your working place.

753
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,200
If you like it, then that's fine.

754
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,640
What do you mean?

755
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,490
Yinfan and I

756
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,500
have actually voted.

757
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,650
It's you

758
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,700
who will be the CEO of our company.

759
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,710
We wanted to

760
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,260
count you in when voting,

761
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,420
but we are only three people.

762
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,150
So the majority rules.

763
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,180
There’s no need to bother.

764
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,080
My own brother

765
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,140
set me up.

766
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,580
An able man is always busy.

767
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,010
Unbelievable.

768
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,720
This is the ID card

769
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,690
of your rented house.

770
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,280
I will send you

771
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,120
the address and the code soon.

772
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,380
I don’t understand you.

773
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,310
I thought

774
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:56,850
you have decided to move out.

775
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,030
Do you still need to trap your aunt?

776
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,920
Otherwise, my mother won't say yes.

777
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,100
And I didn't lie.

778
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,610
I do want to make a friend.

779
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,090
You should though.

780
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,180
You have nearly no friends.

781
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,860
A girlfriend.

782
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,760
What?

783
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,030
You freak are falling in love?

784
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,390
Are you

785
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,190
studying the Love Guide

786
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,070
that I give you?

787
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,170
You are moving today!

788
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,850
Things you don't want

789
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,020
can be kept for me.

790
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:29,990
OK.

791
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,110
What the heck, Bai Lingling.

792
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,000
When did you decide to

793
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,390
get master's degree behind my back?

794
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,630
What book?

795
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,540
I have not seen it before.

796
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,320
That's not mine.

797
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,780
That's your handwriting.

798
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,360
Nice try.

799
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,420
Bai Lingling.

800
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,160
I love you.

801
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,820
Bai Lingling.

802
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,090
I love you.

803
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,620
Wow.

804
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,610
So do you like it?

805
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,450
I know,

806
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,790
I know the graduation thing is

807
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,180
kind of a big bummer to you.

808
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,520
But that's OK.

809
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,360
But I've got

810
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,040
the admission letter

811
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,750
from the Top 500.

812
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,010
Even if you don't graduate,

813
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,640
that's OK.

814
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,860
I can support you.

815
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,800
Lingling.

816
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,190
Please believe me.

817
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,370
I will

818
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,500
make your life better.

819
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,380
Lingling..

820
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,730
I really really really love you.

821
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,360
Be my girlfriend, will you?

822
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,830
Be his girlfriend!

823
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,520
Be his girlfriend!

824
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,070
Be his girlfriend!

825
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,130
Sorry.

826
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,020
I told you before.

827
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,450
I don't really like you.

828
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,040
But you always say

829
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,860
you want a keeper

830
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,690
to be your boyfriend.

831
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,420
That man doesn't have to be handsome

832
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,340
or rich.

833
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,340
You know.

834
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,890
The first time that

835
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,560
I heard this from you,

836
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,610
I was convinced that

837
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,190
you were

838
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,850
the soul mate that I've been dreaming about.

839
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,840
I know.

840
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,070
I did say that.

841
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,510
But that keeper

842
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,380
is not you.

843
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:17,800
But,

844
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,560
but

845
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,900
I'm the one you are looking for.

846
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,740
Am I?

847
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,460
I've

848
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,560
met with

849
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,940
all of your requirements.

850
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,240
Am I

851
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,220
not good enough for you to like me?

852
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,940
You are really not the one.

853
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,330
Sorry.

854
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,420
I don't really have feelings for you.

855
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,380
Well,

856
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,690
I will go first.

857
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,030
Don't forget to

858
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,160
blow off the candles

859
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:37,920
in case of safety.

860
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,220
I'll leave these to you.

861
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,270
That's kind of embarrassing.

862
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,080
Sorry.

863
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,440
Why did she leave?

864
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,850
Online relationship.

865
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,030
Online relationship is unreliable.

866
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,000
Any kind of relationship

867
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,760
has its

868
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,810
success rate.

869
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,900
So some of us

870
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,580
are going to find true love online.

871
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,550
Others

872
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,830
will be single

873
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,940
forever in real life.

874
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,820
That's the same.

875
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,470
Being single in not such a big deal.

876
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,060
Who is single for life?

877
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,630
I like her.

878
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,570
But you don't even know

879
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,790
if she is human or not.

880
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,280
Well,

881
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,280
an interspecies relationship

882
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,090
is also beautiful.

883
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,410
As long as that's her.

884
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040

she blocked you?

886
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,080
Maybe

887
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,070
she had a new boyfriend already.

888
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,140

you have been back for a long time.

892
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,630

Yes I did.

Is that a girl? Is she pretty?

I have some tips.

Also, you are a novice.

That's another factor.

That's OK.

908

Everything is fine now.

1054
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,400
[The truth is]

1055
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,800
I'll give you one last chance.

1056
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,440
Frank.

1057
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,740
Frank.

1058
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,600
I must come back to China.

1059
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,450
Someone is waiting.

1060
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,430
Good.

1061
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,150
Frank!

1062
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,330
Frank.

1063
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,050
It's their idea.

1064
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,250
It has nothing to do with me.

1065
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:35,840
Are you OK?

1066
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,770
I'm good.

1067
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,740
He's such a funny guy.

1068
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,670
Not bad acting.

1069
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,970
Because I want you to stay.

1070
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,230
That's good man.

1071
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,700
Because

1072
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,670
I want you to stay.

1073
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,550
I even think

1074
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,150
how good for you if you say yes.

1075
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,580
Finally yeah.

1076
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:50,960
Follow me.

1077
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,220
I'll show you.

1078
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,730
Follow me, follow me.

1079
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:01,760
Oh my gosh.

1080
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,160
It's really good.

1081
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,390
[Forever is for Ever]

1082
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,120
[Study hard. Wait for me to come back. I’ll do what I promised you, wait for me.]
