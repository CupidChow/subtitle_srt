The so-called  bioreactor

Experiments is usually

10
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,900
multidisciplinary.

11
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,020
It's normal to

12
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,060
see something rare.

13
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,380
But I have made up my mind that

14
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,250
as long as I still work

15
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,340

You are only responsible for logistics.

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,740
Who on earth is he?

354
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,700
What's wrong with this name?

355
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,100
I feel really sorry.

356
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,780
I didn't expect

357
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,820
such a misunderstanding.

358
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,210
You see,

359
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,340
we haven't made

360
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,660
any substantial progress yet.

361
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,820
So could you please not tell

362
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,940
that girl

363
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,700
I am Forever is for Ever?

364
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,460
Don't mention that name?

365
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,580
Alright. Alright.

366
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,220
I...I won't. I won't.

367
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,930
I'll shut up.

368
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,300
Be quiet.

369
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Shut up.

370
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,460
I'll tell her

371
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,540
I didn't use that account at all.

372
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,980
I had sold that online.

373
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,940
As for the buyer,

374
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,900
I have no idea about who he is.

375
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,140
Thank you.

376
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,570
My dear cousin. My dear cousin.

377
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,220
What are you doing?

378
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,090
I am calculating for Bai Lingling

379
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,780
how she can get

380
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,420
the best seat

381
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
and how to make it efficiently.

382
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,820
The study room for

383
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,660
postgraduate entrance examinees

384
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,700
will be open tomorrow.

385
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,220
Although it is in a summer vacation,

386
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,690
many students stay in the university.

387
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,020
So I guess it is

388
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,260
not easy to get a seat.

389
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,020
As there were 600 students

390
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,860
registering for the exam last year,

391
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,700
we assume that

392
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,980
there're 650 this year.

393
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,620
A half of that

394
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,220
is 375.

395
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,300
There are

396
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,940
60 desks in the study room.

397
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,220
Each desk is equipped with four seats.

398
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,290
That is, 240.

399
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,020
I think seats near the entrance

400
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,260
is easiest to get though,

401
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,540
it should be annoying, too.

402
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,060
So we take no account of those.

403
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,420
Lingling,

404
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,140
why haven't you gone to the study room yet?

405
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,360
You can't get a seat if you are late.

406
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,700
It's okay.

407
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,260
I'll go

408
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,350
after I finish this.

409
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,900
If you find it

410
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,620
too much,

411
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,960
talk to me.

412
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,550
We can arrange it for you.

413
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,740
Anyway, preparing for exams is more important.

414
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,880
Thank you.

415
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,690
Hurry over after you finish this.

416
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,570
Bye.

417
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,310
[This is Lingling's seat.]

418
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,240
Lingling, here.

419
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,930
This one. This one.

420
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,070
Excuse me.

421
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,310
Is this my seat?

422
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,360
Yes, I reserved it for you.

423
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,470
Why are you here?

424
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,640
Luckily, I have reserved

425
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,030
a seat for you.

426
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,130
They are so crazy.

427
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
Well,

428
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,030
I'm sorry, Minghao.

429
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,970
I just got

430
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,390
the good news you said.

431
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,650
And you lied to me

432
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,420
about Dong Chao's having a girlfriend.

433
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,970
I didn't lie to you.

434
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,740
-Dong Chao is such a.... 
-Shh,

435
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,420
he really has a girlfriend now.

436
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,390
And he is

437
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,990
showing off to me every day.

438
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,370
So annoying.

439
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,670
Well,

440
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,230
thank you.

441
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,740
It's okay.

442
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,800
I was afraid to bring you pressure if I say it.

443
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,440
Since you have decided to pursue a master's degree,

444
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,240
I will definitely support you.

445
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,250
Alright,

446
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,640
I need to go now.

447
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,430
Remember,

448
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,730
both seats are yours.

449
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,120
One for your stuff,

450
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,380
And the other for yourself.

451
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,940
Is, is that okay?

452
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,290
Study hard.

453
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,800
I will come to fetch you for lunch later.

454
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,550
Come on!

455
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,360
Take, take this away.

456
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,700
Take it with you.

457
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,660
How adorable. Come on!

458
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,630
Leaving, bye.

459
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,960
I will leave for a while.

460
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,260
Where to go?

461
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,200
Study room.

462
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,670
To check the occupation of seats.

463
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,060
Why are you sitting there?

464
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,320
You have taken the wrong seat.

465
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,370
This is your seat.

466
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,750
Why are you here?

467
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,260
I....

468
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,980
Is there any difference between these?

469
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,900
This is

470
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,540
the best one from divination.

471
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,180
You even know divination?

472
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,780
Change your seat. Be quick.

473
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,980
No, no, no.

474
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,990
I will handle it myself.

475
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,750
Change it. Change it.

476
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,430
I, I will change it myself.

477
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,570
I will change it myself.

478
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm sorry.

479
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,480
Why are you here?

480
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,450
This is my seat.

481
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,040
So, it is you who took my seat.

482
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,090
What yours or mine? Tongue-twister?

483
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,490
his and that

484
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,960
are both mine.

485
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,710
It's okay. Stop arguing.

486
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,350
Here, you sit here. I will leave.

487
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,740
You sit there.

488
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,340
We can talk about it outside.

489
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,910
There were many people present last time,

490
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,590
and I didn't say it directly

491
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,810
because I care about

492
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,990
Lingling's feelings.

493
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,540
I don't like you.

494
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,390
You made Lingling postpone her graduation.

495
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,020
Do you think

496
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,700
you can get away with it？

497
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,270
You need to pay for it.

498
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,030
Lingling and I

499
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,540
have agreed to

500
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,930
turn the page over long ago.

501
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,360
That's between you and her, not you and me.

502
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,370
What's your role

503
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,550
in this issue?

504
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,900
Who are you?

505
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,990
I,

506
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,150
I'm a good friend of her.

507
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,760
Then I have a closer relationship

508
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,950
with her than you do.

509
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,650
Zheng Minghao,

510
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,920
what are you doing?

511
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,980
Are you crazy?

512
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,320
Look,

513
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,200
who

514
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,340
is closer to her now?

515
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,890
Aren't you naive?

516
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,530
Look who she is protecting.

517
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,670
Alright, alright.

518
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,060
Well,

519
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,110
apologize.

520
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,500
Why do I need to apologize?

521
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,760
It's he who said....

522
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,350
What did he say?

523
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,660
He said....

524
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,810
I don't think I'm wrong. It's his fault.

525
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,320
But I saw you

526
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,240
beat him first.

Apologize to Yang.

528
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,210
I won't.

529
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,580
Enough. Apologize,

530
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,440
and we can have lunch together. My treat.

531
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,810

Without him?

535
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,820
OK, OK. Apologize.

536
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,270
I'm sorry.

537
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,790
It's over now. Let's go and have lunch.

538
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,970
I'm sorry. Sorry.

539

I just don't want you to

Minghao,

546
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,230
thank you

547
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,290
for reserving the seat for me.

548
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,600
I didn't sleep well

549

550
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,700

And that will be solved.

You need to sleep more.

You really don't have to do this.

I just want to

Minghao,

564
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,380
I

565
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,440
regard you as

566
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,710
a good friend of me.

567
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,930
But just a friend.

Why?

569
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,880
Because I have someone in mind.

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,940
So what?

571
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,330
Who says that I cannot like you

572
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,090
since you like someone else?

573
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,260
You are right.

574
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,510
I have dreamed of the confession scene

575
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,060
to you for so many times.

576
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,200
But none of them is like this.

577
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:41,970
None of them is as desperate

578
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,650
as this one.

579
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,530
I'm so desperate to

580
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,830
tell you.

581
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,570
Bai Lingling, I like you.

582
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,260
I really really like you.

583
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,280
I like you so much that

584
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,750
I think I would definitely regret

585
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,480
if I didn't say it out.

586
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,580
Thank you for your crush.

587
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,620
But I cannot

588
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,550
pay you back。

589
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,470
But I understand every word

590
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,540
of you.

591
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,590
I wasn't able to get up today,

592
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,550
because

593
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,360
I didn't sleep well last night.

594
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,290
I got to know that the one I like

595
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,680
had someone else in mind.

596
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,950
Frankly, I felt

597
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,260
really upset at first.

598
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,520
However, like you just said,

599
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,160
it doesn't matter.

600
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,560
It's my choice to like him,

601
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,740
and it has nothing to do with him.

602
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,460
So,

603
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,020
I cannot persuade you to

604
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,750
give up now.

605
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,430
Because if I were you,

606
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,950
I would not give up.

607
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,160
Bai Lingling,

608
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,340
I'm not here to be your listener.

609
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,310
I don't want

610
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,780
your empathy, either.

611
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,180
I need you to look at me.

612
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,440
OK.

613
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,160
You love him.

614
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,670
You are not willing to give up.

615
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,890
Then do you know who he is?

616
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,250
Does he deserve your love?

617
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,190
What do you mean?

618
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,700
Your net friend

619
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,250
is just a jerk.

620
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,020
I have checked his account on Gate of heart.

621
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,650
According to the invitation code of alpha test,

622
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,380
I'm pretty sure that

623
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,920
he is someone I know.

624
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,690
His name is Ouyang Yifan.

625
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,620
You should have heard

626
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,370
this name, right?

627
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,630
I think I don't need to

628
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,100
say much about what kind of person he is.

629
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,990
Lingling,

630
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,040
I think it is reasonable

631
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,300
that you would like him

632
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,090
as he has

633
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,930
no other skills

634
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,530
than chasing girls.

635
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,220
You are so pure

636
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,070
and easy to be tricked.

637
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,830
Impossible.

638
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,900
I have known him for six years.

639
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,180
If, if he wants to cheat me...

640
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,520
It's not worth it

641
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,280
to take so much time.

642
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,540
What does he want from me?

643
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,090
You are just one of the little fish

644
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,690
in his net.

645
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,860
You just happen to

646
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,290
break into his net,

647
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,550
and he just

648
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,360
flirted you without extra effort,

649
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,020
but you took it seriously.

650
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,600
Lingling,

651
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,420
think over it.

652
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,400
You have known each other for six years,

653
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,980
but why doesn't he come to see you?

654
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,230
Because he is abroad.

655
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,490
Why doesn't he

656
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,870
add you to friends on WeChat?

657
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,830
I can invite him

658
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,670
for a meeting now.

659
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,760
Can you believe that?

660
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,280
Lingling,

661
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,460
if you have met

662
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,350
the right person,

663
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,280
I would send my wish.

664
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,000
I can hold all the words

665
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,680
in my heart.

666
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,100
I won't say anything

667
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,610
and be your friend forever.

668
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,670
But it is different now.

669

How can I

670
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,320
allow the girl I love

671
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,910
to fall in love with a jerk?

672
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,370
I have known him for six years.

673
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:51,800
I know

674
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,310
how he is.

675
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,910
There must be some misunderstandings here.

Never mind.

you are not the

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,460
we need to ask Ouyang Yifan out

702
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,420
and talk about it face to face.

703
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,190
You ask him out.

704
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,980
I won't do it.

705
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,659
Why?

706
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,199
No reason.

707
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,920
You know him

708
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,760
right?

709
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,639
You can ask him alone.

710
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,540
Alright.

711
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,670
I will.

712
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,850
You.

713
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,679
Smells so good.

714
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,780
I'm a good cook, right?

715
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,600
I was eager for the crayfish

716
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,900
for a long time.

717
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,000
I know auntie is the best!

718
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,130
You really

719
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,219
know how to

720
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,530
flatter people with words.

721
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,210
It's so strange.

722
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,630
Twins

723
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,470
as you

724
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,610
and Yinfan,

725
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,990
why are you two

726
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,590
so different?

727
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,930
Perhaps

728
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,240
I have taken all the

729
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,330
verbal quota

730
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,340
God gave my mom.

731
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,530
It's all here.

732
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,080
Mom, I'm back.

733
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,260
You are back, babe.

734
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,900
Come, come here.

735
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,630
What's wrong with your mouth?

736
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,560
What?

737
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,570
Did you have a fight?

738
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,160
Let me have a look.

739
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,300
Are you OK?

740
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,010
I'm good.

741
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,070
Don't make a fuss.

742
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,410
He looks good.

743
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,460
Nonsense.

744
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,300
You definitely think

745
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,230
I'm making a fuss.

746
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,020
Do you know how my baby boy

747
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,780
grow up?

748
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,160
How much time have you devoted to his growth?

749
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,300
Well....

750
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,180
Auntie, auntie.

751
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,060
My uncle

752
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,150
knows indeed that

753
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,370
This family all depends on you.
-Dad.

754
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,170
Well, you...

755
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,980
Did you get beaten, son?

756
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,660
It's over when it starts.

757
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,090
That's good.

758
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,320
It's better to deal with

759
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,580
things without fighting.

760
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,390
But if you got provoked,

761
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,450
you must defeat him.

762
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,050
I'm good, dad. Let's have dinner.

763
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,780
Listen to him.

764
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,950
Is this what a father

765
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,960
should say?

766
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,260
Encourage his kid to have a fight?

767
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,190
What kind of education style is that?

768
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,960
It's enough.

769
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,090
Son, be quick.

770
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,600
Come, and have a seat.

771
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,660
I'm good, mom.

772
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,430
What should I say?

773
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,570
I have made an appointment for you

774
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,870
with Doctor Li as soon as you came back,

775
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,260
but you didn't go.

776
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,770
And now,

777
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,410
you fought with someone.

778
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,460
Don't you know your own condition?

779
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,110
I really worry about you.

780
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,050
Are you going only if I go with you?

781
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,880
Auntie, I can accompany him.

782
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,800
I have much time.

783
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,350
Yes, mom.

784
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,900
Ouyang can be my company.

785
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,460
You should take good care of him, then.

786
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,300
Yes, madam.

787
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,260
Xiaoxiao.

788
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,630
I'm going to bed.

789
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,770
What time is it now?

790
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,150
It's only seven.

791
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,460
I will go to bed.

792
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,760
What are you doing?

793
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,410
I really don't know

794
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,420
Ouyang is your man.

795
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,220
I have cut it off completely

796
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,270
after I know that.

797
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,070
I didn't even accept the flowers.

798
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,680
It, it's true.

799
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,070
I didn't come to ask you this.

800
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,960
What are you working about?

801
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,900
Then, what would you like to talk about?

802
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,130
Have you seen him and

803
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,310
told him not

804
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,740
to contact me anymore?

805
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,210
Yes.

806
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,630
What did he say?

807
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,570
He didn't admit it and tried to play the fool.

808
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,250
He has never

809
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,300
admitted that

810
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,020
he is Forever is for Ever, has he?

811
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,960
It seems like that.

812
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,930
Show me his Moments of WeChat.

813
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:43,920
Here.

814
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,750
He never deletes his moments.

815
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,060
You can find all

816
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,270
the pictures of him.

817
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,900
Look.

818
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,830
[Moments of Ouyang Yifan]

819
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,650
You are not angry, are you?

820
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,940
Do you want to scare me to death?

821
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,620
Where is your laptop?

822
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,340
Laptop?

823
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,400
I need to use it.

824
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,200
What are you doing?

825
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,730
[Forever is for Ever]

826
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,880
[Forever is for Ever]

827
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,430
Haven't you deleted all of those?

828
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,020
Deleted them in the hard disk.

829
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,070
And I still have a backup.

830
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,300
It's not him.

831
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,300
Are you sure it's not him?

832
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm sure.

833
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,660
Look.

834
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,180
Ouyang Yifan is accustomed to

835
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,100
adding an emoji or icon

836
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,530
at the end of his sentence.

837
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,910
However, Forever is for Ever

838
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,660
[Forever is for Ever]

839
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,740
scarcely uses emojis.

840
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,630
If

841
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,510
what Zheng Minghao said was true,

842
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,190
that is, he just flirted with me casually,

843
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,160
there is no need to

844
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,870
take six years

845
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,430
to pretend to be someone else for me.

846
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,390
How tiring.

847
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,080
And from another perspective,

848
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,850
I think Ouyang Yifan

849
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,940
is not a womanizer anyway.

850
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,620
If he was,

851
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,720
he would not post moments every day

852
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,470
and always expose

853
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,110
his privacy.

854
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,370
Think about it.

855
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,720
He is not mysterious at all

856
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,390
in this case.

857
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,820
How could he catch...?

858
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,850
You are great, Bai Lingling.

859
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,980
Women in love are

860
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,200
really different.

861
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,090
You are like a detective.

862
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,980
But it doesn't make sense.

863
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,120
How do you explain that?

864
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,140
He refused you so soon

865
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,520
after I warned him.

866
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,200
It's so coincidental.

867
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,760
He didn't refuse me.

868
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,270
I thought he did,

869
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,580
and I presumed that

870
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,090
he might

871
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,810
have someone else in mind.

872
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,160
I thought about it for a whole day after that.

873
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,340
It's not his fault. It's mine.

874
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,220
I have had a crush

875
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,990
on him for six years,

876
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,040
but I have never

877
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,840
expressed my feelings.

878
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,310
How can I blame him

879
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,740
for not

880
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,680
understanding me

881
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,640
and my feelings?

882
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,190
Oh my god.

883
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,730
If Zheng Minghao

884
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,590
heard that,

885
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,060
he would be so upset.

886
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,580
Anyway, I'm relieved now.

887
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,630
And I hope

888
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,270
he can be relieved soon.

889
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,840
You make sense.

890
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,400
However, if you were true,

891
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,790
Forever is for Ever has already

892
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,390
had someone in mind.

893
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,440
What are you gonna do?

894
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,120
Are you flying to Europe

895
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,420
to get him back?

896
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:41,640
If you really

897
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,430
decide to do it,

898
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,690
I will definitely be your side,

899
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,740
and will book the ticket for you now.

900
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,470
But, you are not likely to do that.

901
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,570
It's like parachuting.

902
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,680
You need to make a decision,

903
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,710
jump or step back.

904
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,310
It's difficult to stand on the verge.

905
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,160
Maybe it's better to

906
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,370
consider the ones closer to you.

907
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,010
I think

908
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,560
Zheng Minghao is really nice.

909
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,580
At least he is

910
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,790
a real man,

911
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,890
and he loves you so much.

912
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,900
I just don't know why

913
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,580
you don't like him.

914
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,900
We need to be realistic.

915
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,420
If you are caught by the rain

916
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,430
sometime in the study room,

917
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,280
can Forever is for Ever

918
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,120
send you an umbrella?

919
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,590
If you are sick,

920
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,690
can he take care of you?

921
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,050
When you are upset,

922
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,270
can he

923
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,870
give you a hug to comfort you?

924
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,350
He can't, can her?

925
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,240
But Zheng Minghao

926
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,760
can give you all these above.

927
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,350
If you

928
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,160
really want to refuse him,

929
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,800
you don't have to be

930
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,600
that cold.

931
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,870
You can save

932
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,100
a possibility for yourself.

933
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,440
Actually,

934
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,580
I understand

935
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,350
what you said.

936
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,380
If I really

937
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,750
need someone

938
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,340
to send me an umbrella on rainy days,

939
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,070
give me pills when I'm sick,

940
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,080
and give me a hug of love

941
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,300
when I am sad,

942
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,410
I could have

943
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,820
chosen Wang Tao.

944
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,460
I don't have to wait till now.

945
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,670
Although

946
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,350
I don't know

947
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,610
what to do now,

948
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,270
I think

949
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,360
I will jump

950
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,410
sooner or later.

951
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,090
I just like him.

952
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,980
I like him.

953
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,460
Even if he did nothing,

954
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,470
I would still like him.

955
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,630
You, you...

956
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,920
Alright, jump, jump then.

957
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,600
You won my support.
