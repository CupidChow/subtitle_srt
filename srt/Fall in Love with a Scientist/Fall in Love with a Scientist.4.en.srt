179
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,300
Three months...

180
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,380
Three months of probation period.

181
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,770
Still not good.

182
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,540
I will change another one.

183
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,780
Your clothes are really not good.

184
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,620
After three months,

185
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,140
the system would ask

186
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,210
if both parties are willing

187
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,540
to meet offline,

188
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,740
like adding Wechat.

189
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,140
If both are willing,

190
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,100
the system would

191
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,620
lock the two accounts together.

192
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,340
If not,

193
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
you can delete him

194
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,260
directly from your list.

195
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,770
It's like

196
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,380
nothing has ever happened.

197
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,800
No, no, no.

198
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,260
There is a bug in the design.

199
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,920
Why do you only think about shortening,

200
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,060
and no lengthening the period?

201
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,020
Some people are really slow in a relationship.

202
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,230
I know a friend

203
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,630
who loved a person secretly for six years,

204
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,300
and didn't confess it.

205
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,460
Don't look at me like that.

206
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,580
Alright, I will tell you the truth.

207
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,300
It's Guan Xiaoyu.

208
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,700
Let me tell you.

209
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Don't think

210
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,860
she is faithless

211
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,220
as she changes boyfriends very often.

212
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,900
Actually, she can love someone

213
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,060
for a long time.

214
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,620
Never try to ask her.

215
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,940
She has her own persona.

216
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,180
She would be upset if you ask her.

217
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,940
Try this, and this.

218
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,250
What does it mean?

219
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,220
What?

220
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,740
Nothing.

221
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,460
So, what indeed

222
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,610
are you two going to do?

223
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,460
Lingling is going to

224
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,060
work in Yang Lanhang's laboratory.

225
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,660
I am choosing clothes for her.

226
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,300
Right.

227
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,140
Since Yang Lanhang

228
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,100
looks down upon me,

229
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,140
I will go and upset him.

230
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,820
Did you pass the interview?

231
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,540
How could he let me pass?

232
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,140
This is not important.

233
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,580
The important thing is

234
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,900
to be pretty,

235
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,540
and astonish him.

236
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:44,980
Come quickly.

237
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,220
Take the outside one off,

238
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,220
and try this fast.

239
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,370
It's not good.

240
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,500
Ugly.

241
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,140
Close the door.

242
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,100
Why are you still here?

243
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,620
Ultrasonic resonance spectrum,

244
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,820
and mould measurement technology

245
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,020
were first applied to measure

246
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,340
the mechanical property of superconductors

247
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,420
at low temperature.

248
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,500
I see.

249
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,700
After the resonance frequency of samples are measured

250
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,060
in the ultrasonic basementï¼Œ

251
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,770
the elastic modulus

252
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,340
of the material can be known.

253
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,180
I see.

254
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,900
Guru is guru.

255
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,420
Mr. Zhang,

256
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,820
the next is left to you.

257
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:38,980
OK.

258
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,460
OK. Let's continue.

259
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,060
Yang,

260
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,620
are you not feeling well?

261
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,780
Would you like to have some water?

262
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,500
Thank you.

263
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
I'm about to graduate from

264
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,180
School of Materials Science this year.

265
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,220
I'm Lu Qing.

266
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,500
OK.

267
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:49,070
[Biosafety Laboratory, Staff Only]

268
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:55,330
[Huaihai Biotech]

269
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,490
Zhang,

270
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,250
It's not what you are thinking.

271
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,099
I didn't imagine Yang

272
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,819
is so playful.

273
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,660
Are you the new colleague?

274
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,420
Hello.

275
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,460
I'm Bai Lingling.

276
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,260
Hello. Hello.

277
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:37,940
Mr. Zhang.

278
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,580
Mr. Zhang.

279
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,300
We meet again.

280
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,900
-Bai... 
-Bai Lingling.

281
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:46,820
Right.

282
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,580
Are you the new

283
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,260
part-time colleague?

284
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,540
It's me.

285
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,380
Hello everyone. I'm Bai Lingling.

286
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,180
We

287
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,220
will be colleague afterwards.

288
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,100
Nice to meet you.

289
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,700
OK.

290
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,660
I will make

291
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,500
a brief introduction for you.

292
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,300
The lead of the laboratory

293
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,100
is Professor Jiang.

294
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,660
He's not here today.

295
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,370
I'm the research team leader,

296
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,380
Zhang Yi'an.

297
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,580
Mr. Zhang.

298
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,140
Come.

299
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,740
You have

300
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,980
met him before,

301
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,700
the deputy team leader,

302
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,300
Yang Lanhang.

303
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,540
This is

304
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,980
our youngest member, Zhai Qingyi,

305
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
a sophomore of School of Materials Science,

306
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
and he will be a junior next semester.

307
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,810
He is the famous future star of the school,

308
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,460
a genius only second to Yang Lanhang.

309
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,500
You are not second to him.

310
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,380
I don't allow you to talk about

311
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:30,980
our guru like that.

312
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,300
Alright, alright.

313
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,540
This is Jing.

314
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,940
She is the assistant of Ouyang.

315
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,100
Ouyang is not here today.

316
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,580
You will see him if there is chance.

317
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,980
That is the recorder,

318
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Liu Yuxin.

319
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,220
I will take you to get the uniform.

320
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:48,980
OK.

321
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,580
Let's go.

322
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,060
Your work is not complex,

323
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,500
mainly about cleaning,

324
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,100
clearing and sorting out the waste of the experiments,

325
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,700
and cleansing

326
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,700
and maintaining

327
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,220
the public experimental equipment.

328
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,180
Right.

329
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,700
Our laboratory

330
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,820
has a flexible

331
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,940
work schedule.

332
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,300
We might do experiments

333
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,460
till late at night.

334
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,260
So, we can

335
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,780
come a bit late.

336
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,940
So, it's okay for you

337
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,020
to get prepared before eight every day.

338
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,220
My work is cleaning, right?

339
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,780
Yes.

340
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,380
Professor arranged it.

341
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,660
Don't you know it before you came?

342
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,780
Actually,

343
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,580
there are cleaners

344
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,540
for the building,

345
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,570
but they are only responsible

346
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,580
for the public area.

347
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,180
The laboratory

348
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,380
is not for them.

349
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,100
So, we tend to find

350
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,020
some students with relevant background

351
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,700
or colleagues

352
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,770
to help with cleaning and maintaining.

353
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
I, I'm a cleaner

354
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,140
with a relevant education background, right?

355
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,620
As long as you have your thought,

356
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,260
you can learn a lot here.

357
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,180
Come on.

358
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,140
Right,

359
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,740
this is the key of your locker,

360
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,220
No. Five.

361
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,460
Zhang,

362
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,700
I would like to ask

363
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,180
how much do I get paid?

364
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,140
Don't you know it before

365
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,940
you came?

366
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,220
I'm not sure as well.

367
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,660
Maybe when you get the salary,

368
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,580
you will know it.

369
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:24,940
Today,

370
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,340
the laboratory is not busy.

371
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,860
You can go back and rest early.

372
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,010
Remember to

373
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,140
get prepared

374
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,100
before eight tomorrow.

375
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,180
What?

376
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,580
Cleaner?

377
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,260
I feel like

378
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,100
an idiot

379
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,540
standing there wearing like this.

380
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,380
What's wrong

381
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,420
with your net friend?

382
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,020
Do you think he is sent by

383
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,180
Yang Lanhang to trick you?

384
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,140
Not possible.

385
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,340
Not that far.

386
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,740
It is because of

387
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,820
Professor Jiang.

388
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,820
He can't

389
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,820
know Yang Lanhang.

390
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:01,860
I curse Yang Lanhang

391
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,820
in front of him every day.

392
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,020
He even curses him with me.

393
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,780
He would not

394
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,260
have done that.

395
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,820
I think you should send a message

396
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,530
and ask him.

397
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,020
What is going on?

398
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,060
OK, I will ask him.

399
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,660
I went to the laboratory today.

400
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,060
Why didn't you tell me

401
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,780
the work is cleaning?

402
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,780
This is just on the surface.

403
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,890
Actually,

404
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,780
there is not much to do with cleaning.

405
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,020
When I didn't have experiences before,

406
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,300
I could not enter the laboratory,

407
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,580
I used the same method then.

408
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,060
What's that!

409
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,380
You dare tell me

410
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,970
he understands you.

411
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,940
I think you are not

412
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,980
in the same channel.

413
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,970
You entered the laboratory

414
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,260
to support the family.

415
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,340
He thought you did it

416
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,540
because you are diligent and aspiring.

417
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,540
Is this what he should say?

418
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:01,940
Of course,

419
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,700
I will not question

420
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,940
your love of six years.

421
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,220
But in this case,

422
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,100
I think it is very unreliable.

423
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,900
Listen to me.

424
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,620
Cancel the

425
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,180
access card tomorrow.

426
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,940
I don't believe that

427
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,580
you can't find a good job.

428
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,660
No.

429
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,700
Why not?

430
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,740
Do you want to go

431
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,060
to clean the lab for them?

432
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,540
Cleaning is also a job.

433
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,340
What's more,

434
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
he took the trouble to

435
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,380
arrange this job

436
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,620
for me.

437
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,420
I can't walk away

438
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,620
after working for just one day.

439
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,340
It's not right.

440
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,580
You need to think it over.

441
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,020
Yang Lanhang is in the lab, too.

442
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,300
It's not a big deal.

443
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,220
What's he going to do with me?

444
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,100
Anyway,

445
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,580
I have different ways to deal with him.

446
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,780
I guess you just want to work there.

447
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,700
This is my plan.

448
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,500
I will

449
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,180
work diligently

450
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,740
for this month.

451
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,620
When I receive the money,

452
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,540
I'll leave.

453
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,410
In this way,

454
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,500
neither of us

455
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,620
has to lose face.

456
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,980
You must like him so much

457
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,380
that you even agree to this.

458
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,460
I have an experiment now,

459
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,010
about an hour.

460
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,320
[Forever is for Ever]

461
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,380
Is it OK if you stay up late

462
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,740
and wait for me?

463
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,260
Why are you laughing?

464
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,340
I'm still here.

465
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,260
Let me see

466
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:16,930
what spell he

467
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,060
has cast on you.

468
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,140
I'm going to bed now.

469
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,620
Good night.

470
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,610
What? What time is it?

471
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,620
Are you planning on

472
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,460
enjoying romance with your boyfriend

473
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,700
without me interrupting?

474
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,010
I'm just sleepy.

475
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,500
Bye.

476
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,900
Just go. Don't laugh.

477
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,620
This is a normal procedure.

478
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,100
I need to thank him.

479
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,300
Zheng Minghao,

480
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,540
I have to remind you.

481
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,020
If you don't take

482
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
actions now,

483
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,100
Bai Lingling will be someone else's girlfriend,

484
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,460
and I think she is going to be crazy.

485
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:51,980
Crazy.

486
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,020
Let me help you, guru.

487
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,220
It's OK.

488
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,020
I got it.

489
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,490
Not a big deal. My pleasure.

490
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:03,940
Guru, what do you

491
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,620
think of

492
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,380
the new girl?

493
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,340
What I think is not important.

494
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,620
It's important that

495
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,210
she does what she should do

496
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,300
in the lab.

497
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,180
Right, right, right.

498
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,340
You are right.

499
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,820
Lanhang,

500
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,980
Leo is coming tonight.

501
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,220
Would you like to join us to grab a drink?

502
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,780
He is not going to lousy places

503
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,060
like a bar.

504
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,500
I happen to have a date.

505
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,380
I'll take a rain check.

506
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:29,980
Zhang,

507
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,940
what is guru planning to do?

508
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,660
Do you have any idea?

509
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,220
Go home cooking.

510
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,460
When we were abroad,

511
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,260
he always said he needed

512
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,300
to go home early to cook.

513
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,700
Cooking?

514
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
He can cook?

515
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,260
I thought

516
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,500
scientific researchers

517
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,220
are projected as a group of people

518
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,260
who can't take care of their daily life.

519
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,180
How come he can cook?

520
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,020
He's always a freak.

521
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,860
Now I'm offering you a tip.

522
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,020
Control yourself.

523
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,980
Control what?

524
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,300
You're acting like

525
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,820
you are a big fan of him.

526
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,980
I'm telling you,

527
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,330
Lanhang hates this.

528
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,010

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,190
would feel awkward

699
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,830
if she doesn't like him.

700
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:55,960
The same to your question.

701
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:57,730
Really?

702
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,360
This is how you think?

703
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,770
Breakfast.

704
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,290
I just answered your question,

705
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,760
so I'll take this.

706
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,520
Thank you.

707
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,320
Do you really think like that?

708
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,870
My God. My God. My God.

709
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,720
Because you said

710
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,400
you wanted to watch movies

711
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,120
with the one you like.

712
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,950
What kind of tone?

713
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,560
What type of liking?

714
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,970
As a friend?

715
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,280
I'm thinking too much?

716
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,650
Do you need to get up so early

717
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,210
to clean the lab?

718
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,260
I have done my work

719
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,690
and I'm back now.

720
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,460
Food.

721
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,250
Let me try some.

722
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,140
This is good.

723
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,280
Where did you buy these?

724
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,920
Yang Lanhang gave it to me.

725
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,690
Despite his personality,

726
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,460
he is good at cooking.

727
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,420
Not bad.

728
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,150
You know what?

729
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,740
They worked until

730
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,040
2:00-3:00 a.m. last night,

731
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:20,930
he still insisted in

732
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,320
making breakfast on his own.

733
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,170
To some extent,

734
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,680
this guy is scary.

735
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,900
Why did he give you breakfast?

736
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,250
Asking for help

737
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,780
bout some relationship issues.

738
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,710
I gave him some tips.

739
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,850
He seems to

740
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,980
have few friends.

741
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,120
So he had to ask me.

742
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,880
Poor guy.

743
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,310
Yesterday, you said you'll help me find a job.

744
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,570
How did that go?

745
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,170
You figured it out?

746
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,520
According to my observation,

747
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,270
I think

748
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,870
doing cleaning

749
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,040
is not very tiring.

750
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:57,670
So

751
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,220
I can

752
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,440
have another job.

753
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,670
OK. Leave it to me.

754
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,020
You need to figure out

755
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,950
the problem

756
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,300
in the lab today, OK?

757
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,360
Hi.

758
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,030
Hi.

759
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,950
So she thinks I'm a flirtatious man,

760
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,520
and I'm touched by myself.

761
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,830
Let's go over there.

762
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,520
Zhang,

763
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,200
I think you are quite familiar with guru.

764
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,500
Why don't you join him

765
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,380
for the meal?

766
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,990
First of all, call me Mr. Zhang.

767
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,580
Mr. Zhang.

768
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,550
Secondly,

769
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,720
I never ate with him

770
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,690
when we were abroad.

771
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,640
Why?

772
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,160
Because I feel depressed

773
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,060
when I eat with him.

774
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,590
My doctor told me

775
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,470
I should stay pleasant

776
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,610
when eating.

777
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,640
Look.

778
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,740
That seat is available.

779
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,210
Do you want to take it

780
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,430
to see how you'll feel?

781
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:25,910
No.

782
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,560
Geniuses are lonely.

783
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,620
He shows his demeanor of a guru

784
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,090
by just sitting there.

785
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,450
I can't ruin

786
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,560
his charm of loneliness.

787
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,300
I...

788
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,850
I just watch.

789
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,410
Mind if I join you?

790
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,330
OK.

791
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,010
OK.

792
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,110
I'm full.

793
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,260
Take your time,

794
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,480
I'm full, too.

00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:35,880
Professor.

796
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,180
Where is that

797
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,110
Bai Lingling?

798
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,580
She arrived at the lab

799
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,090
before 7:00 a.m.

800
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,400
I noticed that she

801
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,240
didn't sleep well last night,

802
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,250
so I told her to go back to rest

803
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,420
after she finished her work.

804
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,400
Today's young people

805
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,360
are all the same.

806
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,670
They don't sleep at night,

807
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,590
and don't get up in the morning.

808
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,980
So irresponsible.

809
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,280
They are nothing like us.

810
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,550
If you didn't ask,

811
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,600
I would never allow her to come.

812
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,330
Just now, colleagues in other labs

813
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:00,960
asked me

814
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,880
why we can

815
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,440
have a special cleaning staff.

816
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,080
They wonder if she was specially approved by the school.

817
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,470
What did you tell them?

818
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,990
What can I say?

819
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,430
I just gave them an excuse

820
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,480
to fool them.

821
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,040
I can't tell them you are paying her.

822
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,720
Please keep this between us.

823
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,200
Fine.

824
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,210
I understand.

825
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,400
You think you are responsible

826
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,620
for the delay of her graduation,

827
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,920
and you feel sorry.

828
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,510
But you really

829
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,820
don't have to do this.

830
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,080
Not really.

831
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,800
I think she is gifted,

832
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,990
and will become successful

833
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,860
if she is well cultivated.

834
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,950
Fine.

835
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,460
You win.

836
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,900
