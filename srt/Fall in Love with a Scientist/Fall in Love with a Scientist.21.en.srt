178
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,140
Here.

179
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,770
OK.

180
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,460
Of course the body was burned.

181
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,500
It's been few days.

182
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,540
Otherwise it would be stinky.

183
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,370
There are many monkeys in the Monkey Mountain.

184
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,340
They fight.

185
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,260
So things like this do happen.

186
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,380
This is the normal state

187
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
of the nature.

188
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,860
I don't know why

189
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,210
it gets so much attention.

190
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,140
It puts the pressure

191
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,260
on us, too.

192
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,220
Did the fight between it and other monkeys

193
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,180
cause...

194
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,420
Maybe.

195
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,540
I don't really know.

196
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,820
Then do you know

197
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,860
which day it...

198
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,740
These two or three days.

199
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,290
You have to go to the Monkey Mountain.

200
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,500
I don't really know, either.

201
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780

It's our experiment subject.

203
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,700
It died.

204
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,340
Why did no one

205
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,220
notify us?

206
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,900
I said I was new here.

207
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,900
I don't know.

208
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,100
What about the person in charge before?

209
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,700
Then I don't know, either.

Hello.

I want to ask you

221
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,500
about Zoey.

222
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,380
Eel?

223
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,460
What eel?

224
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,540
Zoey.

225
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,380
That monkey

who was operated.

227
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,340
Do you know?

229
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,140
What monkey?

230
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,700
A macaque.

231
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,540
Do you know about macaques?

232
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,420
Macaques?

233
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,660
They are all the same.

234
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,140
Who know which one is Zoey?

235
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,620
Excuse me.

236
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,220
They are basically the same.

237
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
The zoo don't know a thing

238
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,380
about Zoey's death.

239
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,860
They don't know whether it's because of the fight

240
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,660
or something else.

241
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,820
No information whatsoever.

242
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,060
Not to mention its body

243
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,900
was cremated.

244
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,700
We can't dissect and investigate, either.

245
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,360
What we know for sure is

246
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,140
Zoey's death time.

247
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,340
Three days ago.

248
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,980
It has surpassed

249
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,180
the observation period of our experiment.

250
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,140
Which means our experiment's

251
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,660

252
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,580
is all good.

253
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,900
So don't worry.

254
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,660
But just to be safe,

255
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,630
we have to

256
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,240
further investigate

257
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,700
other animals in our experiment

258
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,780
to confirm the valve material.

259
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,300
If there are other problems,

260
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,700
we have to increase the samples of the test.

261
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,420
We will also

262
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,620
do a comprehensive checkup

263
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
to all clinical patients

264
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,360
extend their observation period,

265
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,780
and increase the number of checkups.

266
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,820
We have to make sure to detect the problems and solve them

267
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,860
as early as possible.

with such a massive discussion,

00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,860
even the public opinion is almost one-sided.

279

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,859
But as they always say,

355
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,660
if you care so much, you will be panicked.

356
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,540
The man in charge is always confused.

357
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,780
Don't put pressure

358
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,500
on yourself too much.

359
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,380
Your grandma

360
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,140
is fine.

361
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,220
The earphones that Yang gave me

362
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,500
are also good.

363
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,140
The music quality is terrific.

364
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,180
I often

365
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,340
listen to it.

366
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,180
I can't hear

367
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,420
the outside world with these earphones.

368
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,860
I don't

369
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,300
receive their things randomly.

370
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,540
I know you are

371
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,650
in a relationship.

372
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,900
I took him as a family member, so I took it.

373
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,060
OK.

374
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,580
That's all right.

375
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,220
He should be

376
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,980
filial to you.

377
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,220
I want to listen to it, too.

378
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,900
Don't think too much.

379
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,060
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

380
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,740
I won't

381
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,940
die randomly.

382
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,820

Right?

386
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,860
If we can't make it today,

00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,690
we will make it tomorrow.

388

If tomorrow doesn't work,

we will make it next year.

Didn't you say

396
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
Zoey passed away three days ago?

397
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,300
Why did the zoo

398
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,140
and Mr. Tang

399
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,900
said to the press

400
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,860
Zoey passed away

401
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,620
four months ago?

402
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,660
What?

403
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,660
He said,

404
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,780
Zoey is dead

405
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
during the observation period.

406
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,060
He said you were worried about

407
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,660
the lack of living samples of animal experiments,

408
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,820
so you give them hush money.

409
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,820
They kept this thing down.

410
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,660
We can't tolerate academic fraud.

411

how his previous articles

were posted?

421

I heard that Yang Lanhang's

private life is somehow messed up.

423
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,140
A female student in his school

424
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,020
was so bad at academic performance that

425
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,100
she couldn't get her diploma.

426
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,300
After dating with him,

427
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,460
she got the eligibility for master study.

428
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,180
Where does his power come from?

429
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,740
If he can even alter the experiment result,

430
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,260
he can do anything then.

431

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,900
that girl is innocent.

Yes.

Monkey Mountain in the zoo

442
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,180
is not some

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,100
important area.

No one pays attention.

Maybe we can go back to our school

and do our experiment in the old experiment building.

523

We are students of the school

and have paid for out tuition fee.

525
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,060
There is no reason for

Or...I borrow it from you.

703
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,260
What? Borrow?

704
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,820
Borrow it?

705
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,500
I will give it back to you soon.

706
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,300
I...I will take good care of it.

707
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,660
It's okay. I will take good care of it.

708
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,180
Just go back.

709
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,140
Woofy.

710
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,460
Miss Li,

711
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
why are you here?

712
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,020
Hang met some problems.

713
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,020
I definitely need to come.

714
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,980
And

715
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,420
send Woofy here.

716
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,700
Woofy?

717
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,620
What Woofy?

718
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,500
Yes, Yang Woofy.

719
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,260
It is the dog

720
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,420
Hang and I got by the roadside.

721
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,860
I believe Hang will cheer up soon

722
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,580
with the companion of Woofy.

723
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,500
OK.

724
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,060
Do you have anything else?

725
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,380
If not, I will go inside first.

726
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,180
Good Woofy.

727
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,010
You are back.

728
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,940
Why do you buy so much?

729
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,980
Let me help you.

730
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,820
Let me help you.

731
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,300
No need.

732
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,380
Just play with Woofy.

733
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,220
Woof, Woofy.

734
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,660
You mean it.

735
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,500
Yes, it also has a family name.

736
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,780
It's called Yang Woofy.

737
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,700
It's your son.

738
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,420
Yang Woofy.

739
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,420
Really?

740
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,100
It should be Li Woofy.

741
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,060
What son?

742
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,900
My wife has already been angry.

743
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,420
How can I play with my son?

744
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,100
Don't say things like that.

745
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:08,940
Don't abandon

746
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,300
your dog son for me.

747
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,340
It's okay. I will help you.

748
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,700
Would you like to hold it?

749
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,060
I don't know that

750
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,780
you like animals so much.

751
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,100
I always like animals,

752
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,580
but I don't have a chance to raise one.

753
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,180
And Li Feifei just

754
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,700
showed up suddenly

755
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,140
and brought it here.

756
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,260
I thought

757
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,980
you may also like animals,

758
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,820
so

759
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,380
I borrowed it from her.

760
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,380
Borrow?

761
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,570
Yes.

762
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,740
Didn't she say it was

763
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,460
saved by you two together?

764
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,060
Yes.

765
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,180
Partly.

766
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,780
We just met it at that time.

767
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,780
It was injured.

768
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,940
And Ouyang showed up later.

769
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:48,980
So I asked Ouyang

770
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,380
to take them to the animal hospital.

771
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,580
It was injured.

772
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,780
Poor thing.

773
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,100
Come.

774
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,180
Be careful.

775
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,100
It has good temper.

776
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,140
You are nice.

777
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,100
You two play together.

778
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,860
I will handle this.

779
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,260
OK.

780
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,900
I will leave it to you.

781
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,980
Pork rib soup?

782
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,410
Yes.

783
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,180
Woofy.

784
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,770
Li Woofy.

785
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,889
[Shenliu News]

786
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,449
Hello.

787
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,739
I would like to see

788
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,060
Editor Wang Shu.

789
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,580
Do you have an appointment?

790
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,690
No.

791
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,020
But he knows me.

792
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,500
I was an intern for him.

793
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,540
My name is Guan Xiaoyu.

794
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,900
OK. Wait.

795
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,380
Hello, Editor Wang.

796
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,139
Miss Guan Xiaoyu

797
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,659
is here to see you

798
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,380
for some important things.

799
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,179
OK. Understand.

800
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,130
I will tell them.

801
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,860
I'm sorry, Miss Guan.

802
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,460
Editor Wang is in a meeting now.

803
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,659
He is not available to see you.

804
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,980
Please leave.

805
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,820
Not willing to see me?

806
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,219
Then I will stay here

807
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,420
and see when he will come out.

808
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,660
I just don't believe it.

809
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,820
It has just been one year. How could he be so arrogant?

810
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,660
He has forgotten that

811
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,700
I used to charge his car every day.

812
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,220
Charge his car?

813
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,900
Of course.

814
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,380
He bought a new car

815
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,100
and told me

816
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,420
to charge his car every day.

817
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,300
Charge my car for me.

818
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,170
There

819
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,340
were two interns then.

820
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,020
One was responsible for his take-aways.

821
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,660
The other

822
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,580
was in charge of topping up for his phone.

823
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,900
We never asked him to pay us back.

824
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,180
Then you must know his car.

825
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,560
Certainly.

826
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,980
I can recognize it even if it has turned into ashes.

827
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,170
Just say it earlier.

828
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,240
Come.

829
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,120
Woofy, look.

830
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,170
It's food.

831
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,640
Shake hands.

832
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,770
Food, food.

833
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,720
Coming.

834
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,760
Where's Hang?

835
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,910
Coming.

836
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,800
Come.

837
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,110
Woofy.

838
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,950
Thank you.

839
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,340
I will pay for your renting Woofy.

840
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,520
How could I accept your money？

841
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,710
What's more, we found Woofy together.

842
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,760
If you like,

843
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,220
I can often take it here and you can play with it.

844
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,570
It's not proper.

845
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,230
Woofy is still little.

846
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,260
If the environment always changes,

847
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,390
it will lack sense of security.

848
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,100
If we want to have a pet,

849
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,710
we can save one.

850
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,900
OK. Bye, Woofy.

851
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,620
It's Li Woofy.

852
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,630
Don't get it wrong.

853
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,550
Bye, Woofy.

854
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,810
Let's have the soup.

855
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,570
Bye.

856
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,870

Bai Lingling, let's have a talk.

00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,620
I will

860
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,420
wait for you at the nearby cafe.

See. Did I say it wrong?

868
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,640
We go back，

869
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,350
have dinner,

870
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,360
have some milk tea

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,850

873
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,170

00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,110
Hello.

878
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,720
You hit my car.

879
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,710
Wang Shu has knocked off work.

880
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,530
Move.

881
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,670
Let me be straight.

882
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,020
How did you

883
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,700
tell me then?

884
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,840
You said you have a boyfriend

885
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,900
and would never

886
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,880
like Yang Lanhang.

887
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,900
What's happening now?

888
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,540
You are hypocritical.

889
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,340
You just...

890
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,140
I know what you want to say.

891
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,910
Actually, you are right.

892
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,930
Of course I'm right.

893
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,860
I believed you,

894
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,990
paint your eyebrows,

895
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,460
and gave you an eyebrow pencil as a gift.

896
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,770
I was too naive.

897
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,660
Miss Li.

898
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,870
I really appreciate you.

899
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,050
The eyebrow you paint for me

900
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,350
was really nice.

901
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,150
However,

902
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,830
there is some misunderstanding here.

903
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,010
Let me explain.

904
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,520
The situation is different now.

905
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,820
I didn't know that

906
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,040
he was my boyfriend.

907
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:28,880
Enough.

908
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,960
I don't want to listen to

909
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,490
your illogical explanation.

910
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,090
I'll be straight to you.

911
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,480
I invited you out today

912
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,540
to ask you to leave him.

913
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,290
Why don't you talk?

914
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,390
Shouldn't you

915
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,820
offer a deal at this situation?

916
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,140
You are with him for money as expected.

917
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,450
Partly.

918
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,380
Actually,

919
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,470
I was so bored

920
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,600
in the lab.

921
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,740
It is rare for me

922
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,790
to be in such a scene.

923
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,750
I'm quite excited.

924
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,800
We can follow

925
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,980
the normal rule.

926
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,280
You don't have to

927
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,790
jibber-jabber here.

928
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,830
I think you are clearer

929
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,910
with the situation than I am.

930
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,210
If it

931
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,560
keeps this way,

932
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,940
Yang Lanhang's

933
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,200
profession

934
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,630
will be at a danger stage.

935
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,270
He needs people like me

936
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,700
to be with him.

937
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,350
I have tens of millions of fans,

938
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,510
so I'm important

939
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,940
to the trend of public opinion.

940
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,350
I can easily

941
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,270
change the public opinion

942
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,410
with a simple repost.

943
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,790
You?

944
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,270
What can you do for him?

945
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,840
You are right.

946
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,930
I cannot

947
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,020
do anything for him.

948
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,280
He doesn't

949
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,290
need me to, either.

950
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,810
In case

951
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,780
he really

952
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,760
meets any problem one day,

953
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,910
his parents are still there.

954
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,670
There is no need for us

955
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,680
to worry about him here.

956
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,570
What's more, as you said,

957
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,110
you have so many fans on Weibo

958
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,090
and you are pretty,

959
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,290
and paint good eyebrows.

960
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,260
What's the meaning for you

961
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,780
to sit here

962
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,000
and talk to me for him?

963
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,590
Let's finish here.

964
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,520
I'm done.

965
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,530
Yang Lanhang

966
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,950
has just finished the surgery

967
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,350
and needs to rest early.

968
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,020
I

969
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,450
need to be back and sleep with him.

970
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,460
Bye.

971
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,080
Why are you here?

972
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:35,970
You said

973
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,060
you were out for the trash.

974
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,570
And you didn't take it with you

975
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,830
and it's been a while.

976
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,170
So, I came to check.

977
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,270
I was busy

978
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,950
quarreling with the actress.

979
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:45,840
How's it?

980
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,680
Did you win?

981
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,520
Quarreling with me,

982
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,650
I must win.

983
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,320
I win

984
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,410
every time.

985
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,100
My girlfriend is bravo.

986
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,610
Didn't you want to know

987
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,960
how we quarreled?

988
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,930
You can say it if you want.

989
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,070
It's okay if you don't want to.

990
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,590
I definitely want to say it.

991
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,110
What's the smell?

992
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,040
Yes.

993
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,660
[Yang Lanhang, shame of scientists, asshole, shameless, fake....]

994
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,100
[Get lost! Gross, murderer, Yang Lanhang.]

995
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,100
You hit my car?

996
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,900
Yes.

997
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,740
What?

998
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,160
Then why your car is good?

999
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,780
How can I hit it with my car?

1000
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,110
It's too costly, bro.

1001
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,870
What? You did it deliberately?

1002
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,560
You are so busy.

1003
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,820
If I don't do this,

1004
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,870
how can I get to see you?

1005
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,590
Right?

1006
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,690
What do you want?

1007
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,300
Relax, bro.

1008
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,770
Let's have a talk.

1009
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,980
Bai Lingling,

1010
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,810
when can you get back?

1011
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,070
Xiaoxiao,

1012
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,460
I will not

1013
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,970
go back tonight.

1014
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,240
What's wrong with him?

1015
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,500
I'm concerned about

1016
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,060
Yang Lanhang.

1017
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,070
His corridor

1018
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,960
was being painted by someone deliberately,

1019
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,520
saying some horrible words.

1020
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,860
So serious!

1021
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,830
Then, his address must be exposed.

1022
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,270
Are they insane?

1023
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,990
They can do some other things

1024
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,460
if they have the time.

1025
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,910
Ouyang Yifan should be back.

1026
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,850
I will open the door.

1027
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,400
Go for it.

1028
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,000
It seems to be the delivery.

1029
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,330
There is still delivery at night?

1030
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,260
Seems to be yours.

1031
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:54,730
Delivery.

1032
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,070
What time is it now?

1033
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,120
It is still delivered.

1034
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,590
What's in it?

1035
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,070
[Bai Lingling]

1036
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,670
