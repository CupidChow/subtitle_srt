00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,610
and that of former heart valves?

178
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,970
The difference is here.

179
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,260
Granny Wu,

180
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,540
Look.

181
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,400
[Construction of Engineering Heart Valves: Current Situation and Prospect]

182
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,580
The difference is here.

183
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,940
This is beyond my comprehension.

184
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,820
Doctor Li,

185
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,100
I can't understand this.

186
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,540
But I trust you.

187
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,610
Just tell me.

188
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,220
Should I sign it?

189
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,460
Whatever it is,

190
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,460
I'll do as you say.

191
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,820
Now is not the time for signing.

192
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,380
I thought signing is necessary before an operation.

193
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,540
I know it.

194
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
My granddaughter

195
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,340
should be here

196
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,220
since this is important.

197
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,740
Yang went to look for her

198
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,580
and they will be here soon.

199
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,700
What are you doing?

200
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,740
You're here.

201
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,570
Wu Chunhua.

202
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,140
Wu Chunhua.

203
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,220
Why are you here?

204
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,370
What are you doing?

205
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,580
Your grandmother

206
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,220
asked me to bring you here.

207
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,540
When did you...?

208
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,820
Was it the new year celebration?

209
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,180
Yang will tell you

210
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,060
about this later.

211
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,420
Now that you are here,

212
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,540
you should know this.

213
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,010
I have approved, anyway.

214
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,140
What have you approved?

215
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
An operation.

216
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,540
Replacing heart valves.

217
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,780
Look at this.

218
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,530
[Construction of Engineering Heart Valves: Current Situation and Prospect]

219
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,100
What heart valves?

220
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,620
Look,

221
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,940
your grandmother wants to

222
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,860
participate in our clinical trial.

223
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,980
But the clinical trial is....

224
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,740
I disagree.

225
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,500
Why do you disagree?

226
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,500
It's not your operation.

227
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,860
It's mine.

228
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,220
Do you know what

229
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,860
a clinical trial is?

230
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,660
I will have this operation.

231
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,220
Do you know

232
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,340
what a clinical trial is?

233
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,980
I said no. Period.

234
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,100
I said yes. Period.

235
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,420
I trust Yang

236
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,580
and I trust Doctor Li.

237
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,620
What's wrong with you?

238
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,260
You trust them

239
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,780
instead of me?

240
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,740
Yang Lanhang,

241
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,060
what did you tell her?

242
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,460
She fears operations the most.

243
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,340
You can come at me

244
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,570
if you are not satisfied with me.

245
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,210
She is old.

246
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,780
Almost 70 years old.

247
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,700
Will you save it, OK?

248
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,460
You...! You...!

249
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:31,970
Go.

250
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,660
You...

251
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,980
Let's go. Just go.

252
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,540
Listen to me.

253
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,860
Do you know how long

254
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,010
this heart will keep me alive?

255
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,820
I need this operation,

256
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,740
immediately.

257
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,820
Do you know that I

258
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,220
just want to sleep well?

259
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,140
I just want to live at my own will.

260
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,420
Do you know that?

261
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,100
Grandma.

262
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,619
Grandma, it's fine.

263
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,460
Let me explain to Lingling.

264
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,260
Why did you bring me here?

265
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,500
Do you know why I

266
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
brought you here?

267
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,260
This is the place where

268
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,780
your grandma almost jumped down the other day.

269
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,330
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,540
I came to find Doctor Li that day,

271
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,460
because we were having discussions

272
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,900
about our scientific research.

273
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,260
It's classified,

274
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,180
so we decided to meet

275
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700
in that meeting room.

276
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,100
It is on the top floor

277
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,340
and needs an in-house lift

278
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,890
to get there.

279
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,300
So usually no one

280
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,260
will show up there.

281
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,460
But I saw

282
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,700
an old woman

283
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,180
stumbling her way up.

284
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,020
In the first place,

285
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,900
I thought she was lost.

286
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,260
So I followed her.

287
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,820
I didn't know her

288
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,620
to be your grandmother.

289
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,610
Granny.

290
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,500
Granny.

291
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,740
Granny, calm down.

292
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,700
Step aside.

293
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,620
Leave me alone.

294
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,420
Let go of me.

295
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,700
Calm down, granny.

296
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Let me die.

297
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,500
Granny, just calm down.

298
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,090
Granny.

299
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,300
It's alright. It's alright.

300
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,740
It's fine.

301
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,060
Granny, it's OK.

302
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,580
Granny, calm down.

303
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,700
Everything is fine.

304
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,300
It's fine.

305
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,900
No way.

306
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,420
Why did she do that?

307
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,740
Just because of a cellphone?

308
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,060
She wants to die

309
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,300
just because of a cellphone?

310
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,060
You must be lying.

311
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,260
We've been good.

312
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,860
She did run away

313
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,180
on that day

314
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,420
because of a cellphone,

315
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,660
and we've never had

316
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,620
another fight

317
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
since that day.

318
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,980
I don't believe it.

319
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,740
You never saw her swear at people.

320
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,580
It's true. She...

321
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,580
she is quite energetic

322
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,020
when she swears at people.

323
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,020
I don't have to lie to you.

324
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,700
If you don't believe me,

325
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,220
you can check the surveillance video.

326
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,500
As for the reason,

327
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,860
it's not about the cellphone.

328
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,220
Actually, I think...

329
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,140
I think your grandmother is

330
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,660
suffering from deep depression.

331
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,700
I knew a case

332
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,900
from the Internet.

333
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,220
After a granny

334
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,220
took her grandson

335
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,620
to the kindergarten in the morning,

336
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,260
she released the gas when she got home

337
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,060
and killed herself.

338
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,180
There weren't any signs

339
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,660
before that happened.

340
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,340
Her family members said

341
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,980
she was talking and smiling

342
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,900
when they saw her in the morning.

343
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,260
She was also spirited.

344
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,460
Aged patients suffering from depression

345
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,620
look even happier

346
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,220
than healthy people

347
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,060
on the surface.

348
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,820
However,

349
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,140
you can never know

350
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,260
when they will

351
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,500
lose hope for life.

352
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,820
It's difficult for us

353
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,260
to feel in the same way they do.

354
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,700
Didn't I

355
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,940
care about her enough?

356
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,900
I brought her here from the county

357
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,610
to see a doctor.

358
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,940
I know she

359
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,300
wants me to be with her every day.

360
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,220
But I'm so busy.

361
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
I'm busy with...

362
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,100
graduation.

363
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,140
I'm busy with postgraduate entrance exams

364
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,700
and things in the lab.

365
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,140
I also need to work

366
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,220
and make money.

367
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,980
I understand that

368
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,580
I did't care about her enough recently.

369
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,020
In fact, there is

370
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,180
another main factor.

371
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,770
Your grandma told me

372
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,340
that she has a heart disease.

373
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,380
She received an operation of metal heart valves

374
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,810
several years ago.

375
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,900
She even told you this?

376
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,540
If she is planted with mechanical valves,

377
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,540
she needs to take anticoagulant drugs

378
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,140
for the lifetime.

379
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,980
What's more, she will be troubled

380
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,300
by the sound every time

381
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,420
the metal valves close.

382
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,980
I guess this is

383
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,580
the main reason for her anxiety.

384
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,180
Actually, every time I lay my head

385
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,540
on her chest,

386
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,290
I can hear that sound

387
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,100
inside her chest.

388
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,380
I was wondering

389
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,540
whether she was able to sleep

390
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,780
if she heard that sound

391
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,940
every day?

392
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,780
But

393
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,490
there is nothing I can do.

394
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,100
She had to replace the valves.

395
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,750
There are currently

396
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,810
two types of materials for this.

397
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,090
Mechanical valves

398
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,450
and biovalves.

399
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,980
I understand your concern.

400
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,740
Biovalves

401
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,380
use animal-based materials

402
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,460
and can be used for 20 years at most.

403
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,900
Its life span is limited.

404
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,760
If they go wrong in 20 years,

405
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,380
she needs to receive another operation.

406
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,610
But by that time,

407
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,820
at your grandma's age,

408
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,060
she can barely receive

409
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,100
an operation again.

410
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,100
I know she is uncomfortable.

411
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,820
I'm uncomfortable, too.

412
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,980
But at least she's still alive, right?

413
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,620
In fact,

414
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,340
there is the third possibility.

415
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,740
You mean

416
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,140
tissue engineering heart valves?

417
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,810
Yes.

418
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,980
Let me put it this way.

419
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,220
Tissue engineering heart valves

420
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,770
are cultured

421
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,940
by your own cells.

422
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,380
They are alive.

423
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,990
They can grow,

424
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,120
and no anticoagulant drugs need to be taken.

425
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,660
Meanwhile, it's not easy for them to be retrogressed

426
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,460
or calcified.

427
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,500
They are the optimal valves.

428
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,060
It's like

429
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,590
they grow out of your own body.

430
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
I didn't know about this.

431
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,220
Now you do.

432
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,220
Scientists exist

433
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,060
for making miracles.

434
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,060
So,

435
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,010
this is how

436
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,450
you convinced my grandma

437
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,140
to participate in the clinical trial, right?

438
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,580
Strictly speaking,

439
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,460
I persuaded your grandma

440
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,980
to stay alive with this.

441
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,720
That's her hope of life.

442
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,820
And we haven't started

443
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,020
the clinical test yet.

444
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,220
It should be that

445
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,090
I told your grandma

446
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,320
I would ask Doctor Li

447
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,280
to have a physical examination for her

448
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,230
and then tell her about

449
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,420
tissue heart valves.

450
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,330
She might be too anxious

451
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,500
and has misunderstood it.

452
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,010
Then what stage

453
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
is this material?

454
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,980
I am not good at biology.

455
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,260
But Doctor Li will help us.

456
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,300
He now has found

457
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,500
ideal cells.

458
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,620
And we have mimicked

459
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,500
an ideal bioreactor

460
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,060
in the lab.

461
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,980
You know it.

462
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,600
So the thing is

463
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,080
the cell seeding.

464
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,620
Plant differentiated cells

465
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,150
on the macromolecule biodegradable stent

466
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,010
which is in the shape of heart valve

467
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,140
and cultivate it

468
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,020
to grow

469
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,060
a valve we need.

470
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,480
This is the most important issue

471
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,100
in our lab.

472
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,500
Thank you.

473
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,500
What trouble do you meet?

474
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,730
You can just tell me.

475
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,260
It's fine.

476
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,700
It's OK. Everything is fine.

477
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,900
It's fine.

478
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,460
During this lifetime,

479
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,420
I didn't feel guilty for anyone

480
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,100
except my granddaughter.

481
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,020
I could not sleep at night.

482
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,820
And I was always thinking of her.

483
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,140
When she was born,

484
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,340
her paternal grandma preferred boys to girls

485
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,420
and disliked her.

486
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,260
So she always wore a long face.

487
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,500
But I liked her.

488
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,300
Her eyes and brows were like mine.

489
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,220
I wanted her to live the best life.

490
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,500
Later, she grew up

491
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,020
and was marrying.

492
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,730
I tried my best

493
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,740
to find her the best man.

494
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,460
But I didn't expect to have harmed her.

495
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,780
I am so regretful.

496
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,460
If I had been more determined

497
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,380
and told her

498
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,340
'just go divorce.

499
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,820
It was no big deal.

500
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,380
I would support you anyway.',

501
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,820
she would not have been driven into a corner

502
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,140
and lost her life.

503
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,410
I owe her.

504
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,020
I was wrong.

505
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,020
I must take care of her daughter.

506
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,700
She can't follow the same old disastrous road.

507
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,100
I was too impulsive.

508
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,620
I can't die.

509
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,500
I have to live

510
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,020
for my granddaughter.

511
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,220
I have to endure it no matter how hard it is.

512
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,130
You needn't to worry too much.

513
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,900
Actually, she has never blamed you

514
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,500
and she didn't think

515
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,900
you cared about her too less.

516
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,580
At that time, she repeated that

517
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,140
busy as you were,

518
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,340
you still spared time to visit her

519
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,940
and accompany her to the hospital.

520
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,260
She felt sorry for being a burden to you.

521
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,500
She thought she had delayed you.

522
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,140
You should have

523
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,180
had a better life.

524
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,820
It's all her fault.

525
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,300
And she said

526
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,660
she felt deeply guilty

527
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,150
about your mom.

528
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,140
Don't touch me.

529
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,290
Apologize to Yang.

530
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,100
Okay. I apologize.

531
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,940
Apologize to Doctor Li.

532
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,940
Doctor Li, sorry.

533
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,140
I'll tell you.

534
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,340
I'm determined

535
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,900
to take part in this experiment.

536
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,660
No one can stop me.

537
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,340
Okay.

538
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,860
Why are you so anxious?

539
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,420
It hasn't started yet.

540
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,620
I should make an appointment earlier.

541
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,380
Okay.

542
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,460
Make an appointment.

543
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,340
What time is it?

544
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,580
I still have two operations this afternoon.

545
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,580
Come on, Granny Wu.

546
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,130
I'll take you to have a physical examination first.

547
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,700
Come on.

548
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,820
Let's go.

549
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,700
Examination. Examination.

550
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,260
Go.

551
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,540
This way. This way.

552
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:08,030
[Smoking is harmful to health.]

553
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,540
Don't worry too much.

554
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,660
Doctor Li has said

555
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,380
your grandma is not bad

556
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,060
physically.

557
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,820
Her psychological problem

558
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,340
is a matter of urgency instead.

559
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,420
I really didn't expect her

560
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,460
to have depression.

561
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Most of people think

562
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,900
as you do.

563
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,400
It's said that

564
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,960
the old have seen and experienced a lot.

565
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,210
How could they be that fragile?

566
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,660
But the fact is almost the opposite of that.

567
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,820
They are actually the group

568
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,340
whose psychological health should be cared the most.

569
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,140
But don't worry.

570
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,890
I have applied to the nursing home.

571
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,410
They will get a psychologist

572
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,180
to treat your grandma with psychological counseling and intervention.

573
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,820
I believe

574
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,220
it won't happen.

575
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,980
Thank you.

576
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,060
You are more considerate

577
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,300
than me,

578
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,490
her granddaughter.

579
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,580
My honor.

580
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,420
Now,

581
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,850
which stage is the experiment?

582
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,220
We're still cracking the hard nut.

583
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,700
We're going to conduct

584
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,900
animal experiments.

585
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,780
But if it

586
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,620
doesn't succeed,

587
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,940
we might have to make some more adjustments.

588
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,930
Anyway, it needs some time.

589
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,060
Although your grandma is anxious about

590
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,460
taking part in clinical experiments,

591
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,300
it is not a small deal.

592
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,220
And you could use the time to

593
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,580
think it over.

594
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,380
I want to join the research team.

595
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,460
You are already a member of us,

596
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,500
aren't you?

597
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,380
I mean,

598
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,910
I want to officially join you.

599
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,420
This morning, when you sent me

600
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,500
that translation document,

601
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,540
I thought you were

602
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,450
going to quit.

603
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,020
To be honest,

604
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,460
I was thinking about quitting

605
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,940
during these days.

606
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,880
I was even going to give up the master's degree,

607
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,180
let alone the lab.

608
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,010
Then, what

609
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,060
changed your mind?

610
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,740
Because I must know

611
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,180
how the one that will be

612
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,410
put into my grandma's body

613
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,420
sooner or later

614
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,420
is made.

615
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,500
Then you still dared to send me

616
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,300
such a translation document.

617
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,860
Does...does that document

618
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,900
has anything to do with this program?

619
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,060
Yes.

620
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,140
But relax.

621
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,210
I have deleted it

622
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:20,780
only after one glance.

623
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,620
I won't allow it

624
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,140
in my program.

625
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:24,940
Even so,

626
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,420
I hope that you could realize

627
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,660
if the experimental subject

628
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,610
were not your grandma,

629
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,020
it would be someone else's family member.

630
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,300
We can't allow any mistake

631
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
or carelessness.

632
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,090
Solve seemly impossible problems,

633
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,660
rescue people on the verge of death

634
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,740
and lead human beings

635
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,100
to more advanced civilization.

636
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,020
It sounds

637
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,900
distant.

638
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,480
But to scientific researchers,

639
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,660
that is a mission we must reach

640
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,900
and significance of our existence as well.

641
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,180
So I hope

642
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,980
you could respect it

643
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,750
as long as you still work in the lab.

644
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,450
I don't have the say

645
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,660
about your admission to the lab.

646
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,620
Go ask Professor Jiang.

647
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,100
As long as he agrees,

648
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,180
it'll be okay.

649
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,220
Sorry.

650
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,540
I was wrong

651
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,940
about the document.

652
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,740
I won't anymore.

653
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,740
But I'd like to say

654
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,780
although I now

655
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,140
made this decision,

656
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,860
I don't think

657
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,780
my last decision was wrong.

658
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,700
Yes.

659
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,060
Make more money,

660
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,340
gain higher income

661
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,420
and have a better job.

662
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,060
There is nothing wrong with that.

663
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,820
But if everyone

664
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,220
thinks so,

665
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,140
there would be no progress of the world.

666
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,740
Young man, will you go?

667
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,590
Don't rush me. Wait a minute.

668
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,260
Minghao, thank you for your kindness.

669
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,300
I should keep my decision

670
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,180
to pursue a master's degree.

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,860
I almost finished my work.

730
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,660
I will

731
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,340
take the flight home the day after tomorrow.

732
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,200
We'd better not meet

733
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,330
for the time being.

734
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,750
Why don't you see him?

735
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,600
I'm too busy.

736
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,480
I have applied

737
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,440
for the admission to

738
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,000
Yang Lanhang's group.

739
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,430
I have to make up for the drop.

740
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,480
I wish I could

741
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,320
break one minute

742
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,420
into two.

743
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,050
I can scarcely spare my mouth to have meals now.

744
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,310
Think about it.

745
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,670
What if I can spare no time

746
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,580
to accompany him when he takes

747
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,770
a long flight home?

748
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,620
It's so important.

749
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,950
But I'm not in the optimum state at this moment.

750
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,300
Back to my first love,

751
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,140
I behaved like this, too.

752
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,360
Being swayed by gain or loss.

753
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,660
Smirk and weep within a minute.

754
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,130
I felt myself in the heaven.

755
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,260
And next second, in the hell.

756
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,860
It brings back so many memories.

757
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,090
So when

758
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,350
will you meet her?

759
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,790
She has declined the meeting.

760
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,050
Decline?

761
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,620
It will usually

762
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,290
happen between a couple

763
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,380
that has married

764
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,510
for five years.

765
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,280
But what stage are you at?

766
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,200
And it excited you so much

767
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,590
as you won't meet.

768
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,350
Is it okay?

769
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,200
I said I have ended the experiment

770
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,770
ahead of schedule

771
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,180
in order to meet her.

772
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,990
But she thought it irresponsible

773
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,740
and criticized me.

774
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,970
It...it is so interesting.

775
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,280
Anyway, dating

776
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,040
is interesting.

777
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,340
No. No. No.

778
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,860
It is her

779
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,290
who makes dating interesting.

780
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,080
Plant differentiated cells

781
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,420
on the macromolecule biodegradable stent

782
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,260
which is in the shape of valve

783
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,350
and cultivate it.

784
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,360
The stent is similar to

785
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,630
a three-dimensional space

786
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,270
that provides cells

787
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,230
a new zone

788
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,910
with ideal structures

789
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,790
and functions

790
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,140
for reactions of

791
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,360
cell-cell,

792
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,330
cell-matrix

793
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,130
and cell-cytokines.

794
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,940
It's just like that

795
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,870
vines need a stick to wrap around,

796
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,420
right?

797
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,160
Yes.

798
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,440
But ideally, we want

799
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,370
this stick to be biodegradable.

800
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,880
That is to say,

801
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,610
it can degrade

802
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,660
and be absorbed by the body

803
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,870
after completing its mission.

804
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,090
I see.

805
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,010
Kick down the ladder.

806
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,490
That is, retire after having made its mark.

807
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,300
Retire after having made its mark.

808
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,520
Zhang,

809
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,320
why did guru tell me

810
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,290
to think it over myself

811
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,680
and that he was busy

812
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,940
every time I consulted him?

813
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,680
Because he thinks you are clever enough.

814
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,560
And there's no need to teach you.

815
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,710
Really?

816
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,220
Did guru tell you that

817
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,180
I was clever?

818
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,470
The degradation behavior of materials

819
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,940
has something to do with

820
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,830
their physical and chemical properties.

821
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,020
Both quantity and distribution

822
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,160
of polymer polar molecule have an impact on that.

823
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,180
Are you okay?

824
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:24,780
Yes.

825
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,830
Thank you.

826
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,540
Let's go, Bai.

827
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,090
Let's go and have a meal.

828
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,180
No, I'm studying.

829
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:28,940
No study for now.

830
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,780
Come on. Eat something. Go.

831
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,280
You...

832
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,030
[GEOP]

833
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,640
Microorganism ferments

834
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,480
and turns into high polymer material.

835
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,910
That is not feasible, right?

836
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,080
Materials produced from fermentation

837
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,340
is quite limited.

838
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,230
They can't meet

839
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,190
our experimental requirements at all.

840
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,280
Look here.

841
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,770
The note I took before.

842
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,110
Enzymatic synthesis?

843
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,040
During enzymatic synthesis,

844
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,960
there won't be

845
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,720
many by-products, actually.

846
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,360
And it only needs mild reaction conditions.

847
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,110
So it's usually used

848
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,910
to produce those that are hard to make

849
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,000
with conventional approaches.

850
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,020
For example, biodegradable macromolecular product

851
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,780
with optical activity.

852
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,000
There are not very much

853
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,710
about medical biodegradable

854
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,550
macromolecular products.

855
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,100
It's not hard to understand.

856
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,320
The thing is

857
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,790
that the material we want

858
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,220
not only needs to have biocompatibility,

859
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,220
upon which cells

860
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,530
grow tightly,

861
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,080
but also needs flexibility and mechanical strength

862
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,510
similar to natural valve.

863
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,430
Only then can it work well

864
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,460
before cells' growth

865
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,910
is completed.

866
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,890
Now the trickiest problem is that

867
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,190
the speed of its degradation

868
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,190
should match cells'

869
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,990
growth velocity.

870
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,020
If the degradation lags behind,

871
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,260
it'll have an impact on the growth of cells.

872
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,100
But if it degrade too fast,

873
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,230
the structure breaks before

874
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,070
the growth of cells is completed.

875
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,000
It worries guru a lot.

876
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,890
He?

877
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,310
Isn't he a genius?

878
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,080
So genius will feel worried, too.

879
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,130
Of course,

880
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,300
he's a man anyway.

881
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,310
But it doesn't matter.

882
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,700
With my assistance,

883
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,870
guru will soon solve that.

884
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,480
Alright.

885
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,620
No more question?

886
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,970
For now, yes.

887
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:43,900
Think twice.

888
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,230
You might forget some.

889
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,510
Are you sure you've solved all?

890
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,810
I haven't

891
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,730
got it through yet.

892
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,410
When I do,

893
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,540
I'll definitely turn to you.

894
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,170
Okay?

895
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,140
Okay.

896
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,530
Bai,

897
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,830
you know what to say

898
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,470
if guru asks you

899
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,900
why you make such a progress, right?

900
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,450
Because Zhai Qingyi is a good tutor.

901
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,370
Yes. Yes.

902
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,160
I heard that

903
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,350
Professor Jiang and guru

904
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,100
are going to attend

905
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,610
an international academic conference.

906
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,040
Three researchers will be admitted.

907
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,050
I'm counting on you

908
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,930
this time.

909
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,410
An international academic conference?

910
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:22,670
It's said that

911
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,970
Professor Leprince,

912
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,270
a famous expert in cell seeding, will attend, too.

913
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,200
Guru must go

914
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,210
for him.

915
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,390
Sounds so great.

916
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,310
I wish I could go.

917
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,460
Right?

918
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,130
It's a rare chance.

919
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,640
But you should just forget it.

920
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,650
I bet you can't get the place.

921
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,400
Guru.

922
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,340
Why are you two here?

923
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,870
Zhai Qingyi is voluntarily

924
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,920
tutoring me.

925
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,340
Yes. Yes.

926
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,490
This is my junior.

927
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,450
And this, too.

928
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,630
It's coincidental

929
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,320
that we met here.

930
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,810
Would you mind having a meal together?

931
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,970
Of course not.

932
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,940
[GEOP]

933
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,060
Are you Li Feifei?

934
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,060
I...can I take a photo with you?

935
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:18,740
Okay.

936
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,870
Thank you. Thank you.

937
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,080
Thank you. Thank you.

938
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,090
Then I won't bother you.

939
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,350
Wish your new play good performance.

940
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,480
Thank you.

941
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,670
I thought you looked familiar.

942
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,190
Are you really Li Feifei?

943
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:36,770
Are you

944
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,050
guru's girlfriend?

945
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,040
Have a guess.
