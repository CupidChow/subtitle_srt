Hi,

I didn't expect you to pick up.

15
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,480
Well,

16
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,920
I just wanted to try to call you.

Yes.

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,380

I don't want to influence your lab.

153

I just need a person

154
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,580
who majors in Materials Science

155
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,720
to check the condition of

156
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,150
materials before implantation

157
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,200
and do inspection after they

158
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,040
are removed from the body of the animal.

159
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,270
It's not complicated.

160
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,030
It's impossible.

161
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,050
If it's that simple,

162
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,730
why am I sent here?

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,550

But remember,

168
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,030
don't open it

169
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,830
until I'm back.

170
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,030
So I was sent here,

171
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,840
not because I'm very important.

172
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,830
It's because I'm not important at all.

173
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,530
Stop.

174
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,340

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,370
Come back and sit.

177
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,650
You're not going anywhere.

178
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,490
Now you know

179
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,170
I'm not her boyfriend,

180
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,680
isn't it better if I disappear?

181
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,110
You can pursue her as much as you like.

182
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,750
That's my business.

183
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,380
She wants to find you,

184
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,060
so I'll let her find you.

185
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,200
Wait here.

186
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,130
Sit.

187
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,800
Now you know you are ashamed to see her.

188
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,100
Why did you do it in the first place?

189
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,790
I didn't expect her to know.

190
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,470
I was planning to

191
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,900
solve it as soon as possible

192
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,280
and then go back to her.

193
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,370
I didn't know

194
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,940
she would try to raise money

195
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,860
to help me solve it.

196
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,510
What are you gonna do?

197
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,340
Selling yourself?

198
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
Don't talk to me

199
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,960
like this.

200
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,560
Ouyang Yifan,

201
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,240
I know you despise me,

202
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,170
but at least I'm better than you.

203
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,510
I'm bold enough

204
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,860
to pursue the girl I like.

205
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:25,990
And you?

206
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,300
You like her so much,

207
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,650
but you pretend

208
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,650
that you don't care.

209
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,910
You're no better than me.

210
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,720
What are you talking about?

211
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,270
Do you know why

212
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,450
Guan Xiaoyu doesn't like you?

213
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,380
You are childish.

214
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,730
You brat! Who are you talking about?

215
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,780
Ouyang Yifan,

216
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,960
what are you doing?

217
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,890
We were just kidding.

218
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,830
You guys talk.

219
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,320
I'll go out for a walk.

220
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,460
Thank you.

221
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,970
You are welcome.

222
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,050
What?

223
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,810
You think I'm childish, too?

224
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,250
No. Why would I?

225
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,090
Are you desperate to know

226
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,890
what they are talking about inside?

227
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,290
It's none of my business.

228
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,160
Xiaoxiao,

229
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,140
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,450
You don't need to apologize to me.

231
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,850
Is there anything else you want to say?

232
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,630
I will

233
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,020
return the money to you as soon as possible.

234
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,790
That's not what I want to hear.

235
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,660
Although Fattie Li and the others

236
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,670
decided not to pursue the computer thing,

237
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,480
I still feel sorry in my heart.

238
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,920
I sent an email to the university yesterday

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,920
to explain the whole thing.

240
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,280
There is a big chance that I will be kicked out of the university.

241
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,750
Kicked out?

242
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,570
Well,

243
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,450
this is serious.

244
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,460
How can you not

245
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,800
discuss with your friends?

246
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,820
Nothing to be discussed.

247
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,620
A mistake is a mistake.

248
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,100
If I don't get punished this time,

249
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,780
I will make the same mistake again.

250
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,170
That's not what I want.

251
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,520
I'll consider it as a lesson.

252
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,660
What's your future plan?

253
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,380
You don't need to

254
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,480
know my future plan.

255
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,790
You don't need to feel guilty as well.

256
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,060
I wanted to buy you flowers,

257
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,910
and it's

258
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,510
my decision to like you.

259
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,240
I got what I deserved.

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,170
It has nothing to do with you.

261
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,230
What does that mean?

262
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,540
Are you trying to disassociate yourself from me?

263
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,970
Geng Panpan, we are friends.

264
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,850
As a friend,

265
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,030
I just want to...

266
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,400
As a friend,

267
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,330
I want to do something for you.

268
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,970
You've done enough.

269
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,870
So stay out of my business.

270
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,860
Are you done?

271
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,720
It's not good.

272
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,270
No way.

273
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,450
He owes you money.

274
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,030
You will attend SP Group's

275
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,500
gala dinner next week, right?

276
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,230
Do you have a companion?

277
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,920
No. Not for now.

278
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,810
But you know that

279
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,450
I do have a lot of choices.

280
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,790
I don't have one, either.

281
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,390
How about you and I go together?

282
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,450
Would other girls...

283
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,080
Forget it.

284
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,690
Don't. Don't.

285
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,370
Considering

286
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,330
you are in bad mood,

287
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,680
it's a deal.

288
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:20,850
[Electro-Heating Standing-Temperature Cultivator]

289
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,310
Qingyi.

290
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,100
You are back, Yang.

291
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,110
You scared me.

292
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,180
What's wrong with you?

293
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,730
You don't look right.

294
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,660
I...

295
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,630
Nothing.

296
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,650
Is everything

297
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,040
OK with the cells?

298
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,930
I just wanted to have a look, really.

299
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,940
I can't just

300
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,820
stay here for days

301
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,370
and do nothing.

302
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,090
I need to learn something.

303
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:00,960
Move.

304
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,329
Did you open

305
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,290
the incubator?

306
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,390
I... I really just

307
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,270
wanted to take a look.

308
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,910
I didn't know it would slip off.

309
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,420
It slipped off when I just clamped it up.

310
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:12,890
But,

311
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,359
I picked it up right away.

312
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,660
It fell on the clean bench,

313
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,880
not the floor.

314
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,440
Why don't you take a look?

315
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,700
Maybe nothing is wrong.

316
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,369
If nothing is wrong,

317
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,290
why are you so nervous?

318
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,109
Contact everybody.

319
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:27,960
Cancel the experiment tomorrow.

320
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,290
Yang,

321
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,150
You are not sorry to me.

323
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,920
You are sorry

324
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,010
to everyone in the lab,

325
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,100
to Doctor Li,

326
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,860
and to every patient

327
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,950
who is waiting for the new material.

328
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,420
You know better than anyone

329
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,380
that how long it will take

330
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,520
to cultivate new cells.

331
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,860
Just because of your curiosity

332
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,290
and your temporary ambition,

333
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,130
we have to start over,

334
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,430
do you understand?

335
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,400
You're back.

336
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,130
Did you have fun in Shenzhen?

337
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,880
Doctor Li...

338
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,640
I... I...

339
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,230
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,260
I contaminated the cells.

341
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,430
How can they not be contaminated

342
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,860
if you just hold them like this?

343
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,500
Other people may not know the rules in the lab.

344
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,590
But don't you know the rules?

345
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,820
I'm really sorry.

346
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,710
What's the point of being sorry?

347
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,680
I don't know

348
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,980
what's in your head.

349
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,280
And you.

350
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,380
Never mind.

351
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,140
I don't want to see you

352
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,100
in my lab.

353
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,730
Just go.

354
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,000
Get lost!

355
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,640
Yang,

356
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,610
let me talk to Doctor Li.

357
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,790
I did it.

358
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,090
It doesn't matter who did it.

359
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,730
It can't change the fact that the cells have been contaminated.

360
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,780
You tell him, then what?

361
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,700
Will it make a difference?

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,710
But...

363
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,520
Although he is angry,

364
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,740
he will handle it.

365
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,840
Yang...

366
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,630
You are a man,

367
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,810
so man up.

368
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,200
Why?

369
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,920
Hi,

370
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,310
Lanhang.

371
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,270
Professor.

372
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,870
What's up?

373
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm in the hospital now.

374
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,030
The cells have been contaminated.

375
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,590
What?!

376
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,180
What happened?

377
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:37,610
Was it

378
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,540
Zhai Qingyi?

379
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,720
Tell him to leave now,

380
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,270
and don't think about

381
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,410
getting any credit next semester.

382
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,890
It's not him.

383
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47,520
It's me.

384
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,260
This is serious.

385
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,070
Even if it's you,

386
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,130
you can't get away with it.

387
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,310
I'll report to the university leaders

388
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,620
and you just wait for your punishment.

389
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,920
I know.

390
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,050
I'm not a saint,

391
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,780
and I don't want any

392
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,120
personnel changes in our lab

393
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,210
at this point.

394
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,090
Because it will influence

395
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,140
our progress of the experiment.

396
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,110
So, if you don't

397
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,540
want to get expelled,

398
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,380
you have to keep this

399
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,430
in your mind.

400
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,690
Don't do it again.

401
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,210
I understand.

402
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,220
I know you have complaints.

403
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,270
You wanted to go to

404
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,160
Shenzhen with us.

405
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,710
But you were sent to

406
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,050
Doctor Li to run errands.

407
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,310
Have you ever thought

408
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,950
why I did this?

409
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,710
Because I'm young

410
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,020
and I'm not qualified.

411
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,320
And I'm not very important

412
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,330
in the lab.

413
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,000
No.

414
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
It's quite the opposite.

415
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,780
Because you're very important.

416
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,130
Professor Jiang has

417
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,310
talked to me many times in private.

418
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,570
He said you

419
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,500
are young, smart, and gifted.

420
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,590
So I hope

421
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,720
you can be well cultivated.

422
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,820
And I wish you

423
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,540
can cherish your talent,

424
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,880
instead of being arrogant

425
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,270
and unrealistic.

426
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,410
Compared with the seminar in Shenzhen,

427
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,850
I think it's more important

428
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,110
to learn some basic skills

429
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,530
from Doctor Li.

430
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,570
I get it.

431
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,120
Thank you, Yang.

432
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,800
You used to call me guru.

433
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,320
Thank you, guru.

434
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,130
Our new heart valve

435
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,300
will be applied to human body eventually.

436
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,140
So among all

437
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,810
animal experiments,

438
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,570
the most important

439
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,000
is the primate animal experiment.

440
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,380
This time our experiment object

441
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,310
is a macaque from a zoo

442
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,610
in the neighboring city.

443
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,530
Its name is Zoey.

444
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,290
Its heart

445
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,630
has a serious calcification issue.

446
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,400
Given that

447
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,150
the cells have been contaminated,

448
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,410
so we have to delay our

449
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,630
animal experiment on the goat.

450
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,900
The current situation of Zoey is not optimistic.

451
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,820
So we plan

452
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,540
to do

453
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,840
a primate animal experiment directly.

454
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,640
I have done

455
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,360
geometry scanning for Zoey's heart.

456
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,370
The heart valve stent

457
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,050
has also been completed based on its structural features.

458
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,310
What we are about to do is

459
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,310
extracting cells,

460
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,410
seeding and cultivating them.

461
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,180
So this is

462
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,400
where we are now.

463
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,030
Let's fight

464
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,130
and keep trying.

465
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,640
-OK.
-OK. OK.

466
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,090
[Safety Instructions in Huaihai Biology Laboratory]

467
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't know why

468
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,850
seeing Zoey lying here

469
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,410
reminds me of my grandma.

470
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,370
I still can't believe it.

471
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,630
It's not I can't believe it.

472
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,850
It's I don't believe it at all

473
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,490
that you would

474
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,500
make the mistake

475
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,140
of cell contamination.

476
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,820
If there has to be someone

477
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,130
in our lab

478
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,090
who makes this mistake,

479
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,560
it must be me.

480
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,370
You won't.

481
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,220
It's just... I was not careful enough.

482
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:37,950
Right,

483
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,550
I heard that

484
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,260
there is

485
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,520
an Animal Research Institute in Yunnan.

486
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,870
I want...

487
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,130
I know what you want to say.

488
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,400
Actually, I have already applied

489
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,360
for the experimental resources.

490
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,670
But I hope to

491
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,270
cure Zoey before that.

492
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,690
Zoey,

493
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,510
hang on.

494
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,200
The process can be difficult,

495
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,710
but you need to believe that

496
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,060
you will be better soon.

497
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,700
After you are well,

498
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,630
I will take you to play outside

499
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,510
and eat yummy food.

500
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,390
OK?

501
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,640
I think it would be

502
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,480
useful to say something

503
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,830
encouraging to it.

504
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,010
It is useful.

505
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,950
Take a photo.

506
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,090
Zoey.

507
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,240
I will take a photo

508
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,270
to record

509
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,240
the braveness of Zoey.

510
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,620
Bai Lingling,

511
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,670
well,

512
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,400
are you free on Friday?

513
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,710
Why?

514
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:47,970
My mom is hosting

515
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,680
a dinner party,

516
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,490
and she insisted me going.

517
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,540
And

518
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,590
I need a female company.

519
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,860
Dinner party?

520
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,420
Is it the one Guan Xiaoyu is going?

521
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,310
Yes.

522
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,540
Will there be dancing?

523
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,300
Yes, normally.

524
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,190
But you don't have to.

525
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,830
There is no strict rule.

526
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,400
Well, because

527
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,080
I have a boyfriend.

528
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,640
So, I'd think it

529
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,230
inappropriate

530
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,580
to participate in such an activity

531
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,170
with other boys.

532
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,680
Right.

533
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,110
But,

534
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,250
I

535
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,170
have someone

536
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,600
that is appropriate for you.

537
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,400
If it's OK,

538
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,210
I can take her with me.

539
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,050
No problem.

540
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,180
You don't even know

541
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,690
who I'm referring to.

542
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,160
And you are OK with it?

543
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,220
I don't have

544
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,660
a female company anyway.

545
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,040
Thank you.

546
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,300
No, thank you.

547
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,030
I heard that our son

548
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,740
is bringing

549
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,000
a female company tonight.

550
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,720
I don't know

551
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,850
who she is.

552
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,950
It should be

553
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,510
the girl called Bai Lingling.

554
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,190
Bai Lingling?

555
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,610
Who is she?

556
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,330
Well,

557
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,420
I remember I have told you.

558
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,010
Well,

559
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,900
When I went to Shenzhen

560
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,700
for the academic seminar last time,

561
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,710
I thought

562
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,270
I could check our son by the way.

563
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,410
It turned out

564
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,760
he came out from that girl's room

565
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,430
in the morning.

566
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,780
Honey!

567
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,040
I'm about to be a mother-in-law.

568
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,680
Loosen it! Loosen it!

569
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,100
You,

570
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,610
you...

571
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,400
Sorry, sorry.

572
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:25,990
Why do you

573
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,080
strangle me when you become a mother-in-law?

574
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,920
I'm so excited.

575
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,550
Sorry. Sorry.

576
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Are you okay?

577
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,780
You are not having a son-in-law.

578
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,670
Tell me quickly.

579
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,140
What's the situation?

580
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,060
What?

581
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,620
I don't know what happened in the room.

582
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,790
I just found that

583
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,600
he likes the girl at first glance.

584
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,610
Really?

585
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,160
Let's go, honey.

586
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,000
Don't wear this tie.

587
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,880
Have a collar clip instead.

588
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,390
Collar clip is better.

589
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,120
Look at you...

590
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,710
Walk slowly.

591
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,260
Don't be in my way.

592
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,980
I have some errands to do.

593
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,830
I'm not.

594
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm eating.

595
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,850
There are some problems.

596
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,210
But the problem is not big.

597
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,640
There might be some details

598
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,610
that need to be revised.

599
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,130
Mr. Wei, long time no see.

600
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,140
It's been a long time.

601
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,600
Don't follow me.

602
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,450
What female company.

603
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,980
Maybe it's better to choose one randomly.

604
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,400
Are you alone?

605
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,280
Where is your company?

606
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,080
Did you escape and

607
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,210
not invite her in the end?

608
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,580
You ignore me as well.

609
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,350
Hello, I'm Cui Jing.

610
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,090
Hello.

611
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,280
This is from Mr. Ouyang.

612
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,630
Please provide me with the code.

613
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,770
883929.

614
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,150
No problem.

615
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,120
Please sign here.

616
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,510
Thank you.

617
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,140
You're welcome.

618
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,070
Bye.

619
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,640
Ouyang.

620
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,350
I...I want to..

621
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,810
Ac, actually..

622
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,290
I need to go first.

623
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,750
Are you nervous?

624
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,680
I haven't participated in

625
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,070
such a banquet for a long time.

626
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,190
Don't be nervous.

627
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,020
Is that

628
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,650
Bai Lingling

629
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,660
next to our son?

630
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,040
That's not Bai Lingling.

631
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,600
That...that.

632
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,320
What's going on?

633
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,290
I will ask him.

634
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,670
It's okay.

635
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,100
I will go.

636
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,530
Lanhang.

637
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,380
Ma.

638
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,410
Grandma. Let me introduce.

639
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,500
This is my mother.

640
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,510
Ma,

641
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,600
this is the grandma

642
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,770
of Bai Lingling.

643
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,600
You turn out to be Lingling's grandma.

644
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Nice to meet you.

645
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,120
I'm Lanhang's mother,

646
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,220
Gong Liyan.

647
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,310
Hello, Ms. Gong.

648
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,620
I, I'm so

649
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,630
honored

650
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,010
to participate in such a banquet.

651
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,200
It's so nice.

652
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,170
Thank you.

653
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,060
As long as you

654
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,150
enjoy it.

655
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,080
Name some music.

656
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,340
I will tell the band to play it for you.

657
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:16,890
OK.

658
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:17,560
Just tell Hang

659
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,950
for whatever you need.

660
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,050
I really

661
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,850
like the music now.

662
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,320
I'm so glad you like it.

663
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,420
Well,

664
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,140
I need to greet with other guests.

665
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,900
Hang. Take good care of her.

666
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,660
No problem.

667
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,960
See you.

668
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:31,930
See you.

669
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,650
When I stepped in,

670
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,830
I was really nervous

671
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,880
because I worry about being expelled.

672
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,070
I didn't imagine

673
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,830
your mom being so kind

674
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,220
as she is the head of such a big group.

675
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,610
And you and your mom

676
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,500
really look similar,

677
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,890
good-looking.

678
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,860
Grandma,

679
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,200
you are good-looking, too.

680
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,210
Where is Lingling?

681
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,140
It's been a while.

682
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,620
Is she lost?

683
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,050
Well.

684
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,890
Grandma.

685
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,150
Please wait for me here.

686
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,030
I will find her.

687
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,580
OK. OK.

688
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,500
I will be back soon.

689
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:39,750
Are you glad?

690
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,140
Hello, Mr. Shi.

691
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,950
Long time no see.

692
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:07,850
Hang.

693
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,790
What's the situation now?

694
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,300
Do you have any plans tonight?

695
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,030
What plan?

696
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,010
Don't you confess

697
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,600
in such a big occasion?

698
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,840
Think about it.

699
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,190
She doesn't hate

700
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,110
you that much now.

701
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,830
You have laid a foundation,

702
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,460
right?

703
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,190
So,

704
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,950
it's just a timing you are lacking.

705
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,250
Confess everything.

706
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,020
This is a really

707
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,200
rare chance.

708
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,720
Confessing your love to her

709
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,230
in front of the whole world.

710
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,840
No girls will refuse.

711
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,360
Really?

712
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,810
But I didn't prepare anything.

713
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,360
I will help you.

714
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,870
Alright.

715
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,139
Come on!

716
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:14,960
Come on!

717
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,520
Yang.

718
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,080
Yang.

719
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,739
Here.

720
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,449
Why are you hiding here?

721
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,630
It's about to start now.

722
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,679
Well,

723
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,030
I don't feel well.

724
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,219
So, I think I might leave first.

725
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,500
Are you leaving?

726
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,989
No, you can't.

727
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,820
Wh, why?

728
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,310
Grandma is still inside.

729
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,200
I know.

730
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,000
Grandma,

731
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,850
she might

732
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,780
not be able to dance today.

733
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,290
Never mind.

734
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,930
I will tell you the truth.

735
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,650
I ran into

736
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,640
my dad

737
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,070
and that woman again.

738
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,130
So, is it okay

739
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,220
that you bring

740
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,400
grandma out?

741
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,960
I know my grandma.

742
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,600
If she sees them,

743
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,980
she will definitely be inflamed.

744
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,290
Her body...

745
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,060
I will wait here for you.

746
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,190
Please bring her here.

747
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,200
You are really leaving?

748
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,840
But she seemed to be happy

749
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,230
inside.

750
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,290
She is now.

751
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,880
But if she sees them,

752
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,730
she will not.

753
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,330
Editor Tang,

754
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,640
see you next time.

755
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,520
OK. See you.

756
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,640
Editor Tang.

757
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,070
Mr. Ma.

758
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,950
Hello. It's a long time since we last met.

759
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,500
Right.

760
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,420
How are you?

761
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,550
I'm in Guangdong recently.

762
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,440
Are you?

763
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,570
Here.

764
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,040
I'll introduce a friend to you.

765
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,540
Ma.

766
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,000
Ma.

767
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,640
Why are you here?

768
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,360
We cannot go to

769
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,700
where you are?

770
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,300
I don't mean it.

771
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,040
Are you well these years?

772
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,700
I'm good

773
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,120
and will live temporarily.

774
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,280
Don't be like that.

775
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,910
Actually,

776
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,230
I always think about you

777
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,120
since Nuo's mother passed away.

778
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,260
I know

779
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,030
you don't want to see me.

780
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,330
So,

781
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,430
I never go to see you.

782
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,610
You do understand.

783
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,100
Right.

784
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,020
Ma,

785
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,460
have you received the money

786
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,590
I asked cousin to send you?

787
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,810
What money?

788
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,680
I have never spent a cent from you.

789
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,360
It shouldn't be.

790
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,250
-I.... 
-Never mind.

791
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,170
I'm not here

792
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,470
to chat with you.

793
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,490
I just ask you to do me a favor.

794
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,620
Not a favor.

795
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,300
Please say it.

796
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,900
Lingling is here.

797
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,010
If you see her later,

798
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,650
please pretend to be a stranger.

799
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,090
She has a high self-esteem.

800
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,050
I don't want her to be embarrassed

801
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,110
in front of so many people,

802
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,040
and let everybody know that

803
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,930
she has a father who

804
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,490
doesn't like her.

805
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,660
Ma.

806
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,150
Why do you say that?

807
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,110
Sorry, the words

808
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,370
are not pleasant.

809
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,080
But it's a favor.

810
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,760
You have

811
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,270
heard grandma.

812
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,170
Just pretend to be a stranger.

813
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:46,650
Let's go.

814
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,400
Brothers and sisters,

815
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,530
and my dearest

816
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,830
friends.

817
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,430
Good evening.

818
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,780
Bravo!

819
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,250
I really appreciate

820
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,810
that you can be here

821
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,360
for the banquet of the Group.

822
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,120
Thank you for

823
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,100
your help

824
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,060
in the past years.

825
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,740
I would like to

826
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,790
say thank you.

827
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,800
So,

828
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,860
I hope everybody

829
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,160
can have fun

830
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,130
tonight.

831
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,180
We are here for fun.

832
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,930
Smile.

833
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,530
Smile.

834
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,130
This is nice.

835
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,820
How's it going?

836
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,910
Are you still leaving?

837
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,490
Not leaving?

838
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,180
Great.

839
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,610
My mother just finished talking.

840
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,250
The first dance is about to start.

841
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,760
We are leaving for the dance now.

842
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,350
Are you Miss Bai,

843
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,140
Bai Lingling?

844
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,360
Mr. Shi

845
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,750
asked me to give this to you.

846
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:20,550
Thank you.

847
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,010
OK.

848
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,620
[To: Bai Lingling]

849
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,400
We will leave now.

850
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,880
Have fun

851
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,010
with grandma.

852
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,190
Father.
