00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,690
I want to sleep.

174
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm really fine.

175
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,330
You can just go home and rest.

176
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,890
Let him rest.

177
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,820
Let him rest.

178
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,240
Let him rest.

179
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,410
Come on.

180
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,420
Honey.

181
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,140
You get some rest.

182
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,560
Don't move.

183
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,530
Let him sleep.

184
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,660
Sleep. Sleep.

185
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,520
We are leaving.

186
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,360
-I'll see aunt and uncle out. 
-Let's go.

187
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,120
I'll see you out.

188
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,430
I'll talk to you later.

189
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,190
Leave him to me.

190
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,410
Don't worry.

191
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,500
Bye.

192
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,050
Bye.

193
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,540
She didn't come

194
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,420
when you were in coma.

195
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,000
How about waiting for another while?

196
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,010
You don't have to say it

197
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,060
right now.

198
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,910
I just think it's been a long time.

199
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,090
I don't want to wait.

200
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,530
I want to gain her forgiveness

201
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,910
as I confess early.

202
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,270
You are here.

203
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,190
Why are you standing here? Go inside.

204
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,080
I...

205
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,680
I'm just dropping by.

206
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,320
行了 Fine.

207
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,580
Go in.

208
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,230
He just received an operation.

209
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,570
Don't make him excited.

210
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,070
Go in.

211
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,370
Feeling better?

212
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:20,980
I'm fine.

213
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,210
I promised you.

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,850
I won't die since I've said it.

215
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,520
I wonder

216
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,870
if you still keep that little tin box

217
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,870
that I gave you.

218
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,690
Of course.

219
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,750
It's been beside my bed.

220
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,100
Actually, I was ready to pay back the money

221
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,360
a long time ago.

222
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,870
But I think

223
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,340
it's been years,

224
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,060
and I should give you interests.

225
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,460
So I put more in it.

226
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,770
When I was lying on the operation table,

227
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,000
I was unconscious.

228
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,130
I kept recalling those memories

229
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,690
when we were kids.

230
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,280
You know what?

231
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,460
In fact,

232
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,600
when I ran home from the hospital,

233
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,240
I was really happy.

234
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,000
I said to my mom,

235
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,180
"Mom,

236
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,530
I just gave all my money in the little tin box

237
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,720
to a little girl,

238
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,770
so she can buy a new heart

239
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,530
to save her mom."

240
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,430
I thought she would praise me and

241
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
commend me.

242
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,030
It turned out that

243
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,340
she scolded me

244
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,390
relentlessly.

245
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,540
Then she cried.

246
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,110
She's never been like this.

247
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,340
And I also cried,

248
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,020
because I found out that

249
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,830
actually,

250
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,850
we could not buy a heart with money.

251
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,330
It was

252
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,550
a white lie.

253
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,290
But I didn't cry for myself.

254
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,010
I cried because

255
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,340
I lied to you.

256
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,120
When that little girl

257
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,760
was extremely desperate and helpless,

258
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,240
I gave her

259
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,370
a false hope.

260
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,770
From that day on, I would

261
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,080
dream of that little girl everyday.

262
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,530
She was crying on the corridor,

263
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,660
asking me

264
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,730
where she could buy a heart

265
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,910
and what she should do.

266
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,200
After many years,

267
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,180
I found the answer

268
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,180
in my dad's lab.

269
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,080
Even though money can't buy a heart,

270
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,350
as long as I try,

271
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,740
there is a chance that I can make a heart,

272
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,550
one that will never be broken.

273
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,670
And after that,

274
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,560
no more kids will

275
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,860
lose their mother.

276
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,720
You don't need to feel guilty.

277
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,750
At that time,

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,520
if you didn't give me those money,

279
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
I may not have the money to buy

280
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,920
a ticket to

281
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,760
my grandma's house.

282
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,869
And I would become a little beggar

283
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,130
on the streets.

284
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,780
That's not gonna happen.

285
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,349
I will find you

286
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,630
and take you home.

287
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,620
I mean my mom,

288
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,170
she likes girls.

289
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,340
That crying little girl

290
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,620
has finally grown up.

291
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,220
Do you know it, mom?

292
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,700
Yes. Don't be anxious.

293
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
Do you know where she is?

294
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,810
I asked other people to find her.

295
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,160
If you are still worried,

296
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,710
I can take you there now.

297
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,550
Great.

298
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,190
Let's go.

299
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,870
Come on.

300
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,930
Lingling, come on.

301
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,030
Lingling, come on.

302
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,250
Lingling, come on.

303
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,150
Why does this little girl

304
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,450
behave like a monkey?

305
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,880
Are you sure that's her?

306
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,600
Now you can feel relieved.

307
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,110
Let's go.

308
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,020
So,

309
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,860
you know it's me this whole time.

310
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,590
Yes.

311
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,320
Why didn't you

312
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,490
tell me early?

313
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,970
You have such a short fuse.

314
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,940
Who dare to tell you

315
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,250
since you just block someone out of no reason.

316
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,930
When did I...?

317
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,950
What do you mean?

318
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,400
I didn't take it.

319
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,700
Still won't admit it?

320
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,090
Why is this pencil case

321
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,430
in your schoolbag?

322
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,070
You stole things and

323
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,370
you're lying at a young age.

324
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,590
Tell your parents

325
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,640
to come to the school tomorrow.

326
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,530
I don't have parents.

327
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,150
Hi, Lingling.

328
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,970
I'm Miss Wu.

329
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,860
I found the one

330
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,500
who stole the pencil case.

331
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,880
I'm really sorry.

332
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,900
You are a good kid,

333
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,450
but I have wronged you.

334
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,390
I apologize to you now.

335
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,370
I hope you can forgive me,

336
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,420
OK?

337
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,680
I said it. I didn't steal it.

338
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,270
I'm a sophomore

339
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,090
♫ I'm getting used ♫

340
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,830
and I don't have classes today.

341
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,640
♫ To being alone ♫

342
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,390
What about you?

343
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,860
Which is your ideal university?

344
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,840
I don't plan to go to any universities.

345
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,940
♫ I'm getting used ♫

346
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,330
♫ To hiding everything in my heart ♫

347
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,880
I think you can

348
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,180
make it, totally.

349
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,270
How about

350
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,000
♫ As time went by, the feeling faded away ♫

351
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,700
my university?

352
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,800
I will be waiting for you at Huaihai University.

353
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,890
♫ I thought it an illusion ♫

354
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,590
♫ Till his appearance ♫

355
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,880
♫ He lightened my world up ♫

356
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,810
My score exceeded 500

357
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,220
for the first time in this practice test.

358

♫ The weather of Wednesday ♫

359
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,810
My teacher said it's very likely that I'll be admitted

360
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,420
to Huaihai University if I keep trying.

361
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,790
So are we going to meet each other

362
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,850
♫ Is fair ♫

363
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,190
in reality by that time?

364
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,290
Can you recognize me?

♫ Is it ♫

366
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,430
♫ Rainy or sunny in your place? ♫

367
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,230
Sure.

368
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,450
I can recognize you at first glance.

369
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,640
♫ Or parted by the Pacific ♫

♫ It's actually night-time there ♫

371
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,220
Liar.

372
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,270
I don't even know you.

373
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,280
Should we

374
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,150
♫ Then I wish you gentle starlight ♫

375
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,540

♫ Days with your favor ♫

379
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,220
holding jasmine flowers.

380
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,230
That will be me.

381
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,990
♫ And nights eager for your hug ♫

382
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,720
Don't be so dramatic.

♫ You treasure me so well ♫

384
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,360
OK. It's a deal.

385

♫ That I don't need to strive to be strong ♫

♫ We can share time ♫

♫ And moonlight as well ♫

♫ And nights eager for your hug ♫

00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,550
♫ You treasure me so well ♫

393

♫ That I don't need to strive to be strong ♫

394
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,220
♫ We can share time ♫

395
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,090
So this is the smell

396
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,100
on you.

397
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,320
When I hear your voice,

398

♫ And moonlight as well ♫

399
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
I think it's

400
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,260
familiar.

401
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,360
I don't know why.

402
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,020

406
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,260

♫ No fear for aging anymore ♫

408
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,670
I'm back and I'll never leave again.

409
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,610
Actually, I have been holding the grudge.

410
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,830
Because of my ignorance when I was a kid,

411
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,510
I gave you a false hope.

412
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,540
I've seen you being desperate.

413
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,800
So I was afraid

414
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:35,720
you would never believe there is hope

415
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,320
in your life anymore.

416
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,750
I think I'm responsible for it.

417
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,060
I need to be your guardian angel

418
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,910
to see you grow up healthily.

419
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,060
Using the seven years of Forever is for Ever

420
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,040
and also the 17 years of Yang Lanhang.

421
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,220
Actually, as soon as I finished my topic

422
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,970
in Europe,

423
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,230
I came back.

424
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,120
But you have blocked me.

425
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,560
In fact, I have sent messages to you,

426
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,160
telling you that I would attend your graduation ceremony.

427

Lingling.

428
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,950

429
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,160
Lingling.

430
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:37,960
Lingling.

431
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,190
I'm sorry.

432
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,930
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,760
Lingling.

434
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,310
Lingling.

435
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,100
What happened?

436
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,910
What happened, darling?

437
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,660
Let me see.

438
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,310
Why are you weeping?

439
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,500
Alright. Alright.

440
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,800
Give you a hug.

441
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,520
Come on.

442
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,370
What on earth happened?

443
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,820
Stop crying. Stop crying.

444
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,210
What's wrong? Tell me.

445
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,730
I just feel

446
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,850
too sorrowful.

447
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,630
During these days, I always felt like

448
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,940
I have fallen in love with two guys.

449
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,310
How can I be in love with

450
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,710
two guys?

451
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,550
Every morning when I woke up,

452
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,960
I felt myself so hateful.

453
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,750
And I thought to myself that

454
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,490
I should give up both of them.

455
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,100
But only then did I know

456
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,660
the two of them were the same person.

457
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,350
[Ouyang Yifan]

458
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,110
Hello,

459
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,540
there's something wrong with Hang. Hurry to the hospital.

460
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,740
It should be rejection reaction.

461
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,510
When in a coma,

462
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,810
he kept calling your name.

463
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,250
We have no idea about

464
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,380
when he would wake up.

465
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,670
I see.

466
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,440
I want to

467
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,330
stay with him alone for a while.

468
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,420
Okay.

469
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,310
Then, you chat to him.

470
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,110
Maybe he will wake up

471
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,790
when he hears you.

472
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,980
I know you are fine now.

473
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,780
Or you should

474
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,000
be in the ICU.

475
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,180
Your heart rate is quite normal, too.

476
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,850
Well,

477
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,320
you don't need to open your eyes.

478
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,170
And you don't need to say anything.

479
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,730
Let me finish my words first.

480
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,110
At that time,

481
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,810
my dad left.

482
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,880
And my mom left as well.

483
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,610
I returned to that small county

484
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,770
and had almost accepted

485
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,380
that was my life.

486
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,690
A life with no hope.

487
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,930
Laughing and joking

488
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,270
as I appeared to be,

489
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,490
my heart had died

490
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,020
even when I was climbing trees mirthfully.

491
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,800
Then,

492
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,330
Forever is for Ever appeared.

493
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,930
He told me

494
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,290
'don't be upset',

495
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,970
'don't give up'

496
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,610
and 'life is full of

497
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,960
hope and possibility'.

498
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,690
I believed him.

499
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,290
I really believed him.

500
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,590
It's just like

501
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,360
I believed that boy

502
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,120
at the door to the operating room.

503
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,090
He told me

504
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,770
that heart could be bought with money.

505
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,970
Why did I believe

506
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,270
such a nonsense?

507
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,770
But what happened next?

508
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,100
I felt disappointed over and over again.

509
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,210
We can never buy a heart with money.

510
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,830
Forever is for Ever had flown away, too.

511
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,150
So, I told to myself

512
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,180
not to hold those fantasies anymore

513
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,070
and I should resign myself

514
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,370
to destiny.

515
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,060
But surprisingly,

516
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,590
he came back.

517
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,700
And Yang Lanhang appeared.

518
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,230
For them two,

519
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,820
one had ruined

520
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,630
my graduation thesis defenses;

521
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:21,930
and the other

522
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,280
asked me to be an office girl.

523
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,000
But I

524
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,220
actually fell in love

525
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,020
with both of them.

526
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,830
Do you know

527
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,420
how grievous I was?

528
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,820
Every day I was thinking

529
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,290
why I would be such a guy.

530
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,770
Why did I

531
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,240
fall in love with two men?

532
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
I should be the love rat

533
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,780
in the TV play

534
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,790
that would be severely abused by audience.

535
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,960
Please do not abuse yourself.

536
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,680
Why don't you look at me?

537
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,220
I can't say these out,

538
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,780
if I watch you.

539
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,780
You don't need to say.

540
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,220
I can understand.

541
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,660
Before I went abroad,

542
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,870
I admit

543
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,580
that I didn't think that much.

544
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,480
My mind was full of scientific research.

545
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,560
Later, you were admitted to Huaihai University.

546
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,620
And I didn't think

547
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,480
I had anything to worry about, either.

548
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,940
It was not until the plane descended

549
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,070
that I found

550
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,030
you had already blacklisted me.

551
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,770
Only then did I get panic.

552
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,540
During the days when I was out of touch with you, I,

553
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,650
I then realized

554
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,890
I have...

555
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,400
I have early fallen in love with you.

556
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,030
Sorry.

557
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,350
Lingling,

558
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,000
could you please forgive me?

559
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,900
I know

560
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,870
I was too dull.

561
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,110
I should not have kept it from you.

562
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,850
And I should not be that coward.

563
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,070
But I was thinking

564
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,030
I should confess

565
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,920
when you do not

566
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,290
feel that antipathy against me.

567
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,180
What's more, I should not

568
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,820
put you in such a dilemma.

569
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,830
Lingling,

570
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,920
please tell me what I should do

571
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,770
to earn your forgiveness, okay?

572
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,260
I'll give it back to you.

the ex-school hunk of Huaihai University

has returned.

00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,330
I have been to your

689
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,460
vocal concerts...

690
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,600
twice.

691
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,180
Twice.

692
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,360
Really?

693
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,660
That's great.

694
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,250
Then

695
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,680
do me a personal favor.

696
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,110
If he is

697
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,860
unkind to you,

698
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,830
just turn to me.

699
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,550
I'll offer you after-sales service.

700
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,160
When did you know him?

701
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,170
I don't know that at all.

702
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,490
I really like him.

703
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,390
I know you do.

704
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,480
So,

705
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:07,750
you...

706
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,390
could you give me a reply now?

707
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,400
This is a special surprise we prepared.

708
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,700
Its name is Miss You Already.

709
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,300
Please have a taste.

710
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,810
Not bad, Zheng Minghao.

711
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,200
You prepared so many surprises.

712
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,410
I'll taste it for you.

713
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,360
Why does the steak

714
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,710
smell jasmine?

715
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,270
Have a try?

716
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,280
Minghao,

717
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,670
I...

718
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,400
sorry.

719
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,250
But,

720
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,260
thank you very much.

721
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:52,940
Sorry.

722
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:05,840
Stand there.

723
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,110
Come over.

724
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,650
Come over.

725
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,700
Are you crazy?

726
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:22,800
Why do you

727
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,310
run away from the hospital?

728
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,410
You are going to be a cook?

729
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,450
It has been a long time since your last visit.

730
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,150
I'm afraid you would be another guy's girlfriend

731
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,390
when I recover from the illness.

732
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,360
This is not the right excuse

733
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,700
for your running out casually.

734
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,010
What if an accident happened?

735
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,100
Can you afford

736
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,810
the effort of us all?

737
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,370
What if the clinical test failed?

738
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,510
Go. Bring you back to hospital.

739
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,600
Wait, wait a minute.

740
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,310
Will you come to visit me tomorrow?

741
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,000
I will.

742
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,650
Will you spend the Spring Festival

743
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,590
with me?

744
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,330
Because during this festival,

745
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,680
my dad will go abroad for exchange study

746
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,100
for three months.

747
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,040
And my mom will leave for Australia

748
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,550
because of a program.

749
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,230
I....

750
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,610
I see.

751
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,170
I will.

752
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,460
Great.

753
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,510
I won't have to celebrate

754
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,390
the new year alone.

755
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:25,550
I....

756
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,770
I'll bring you somewhere.

757
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,570
Go.

758
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,580
This angelic brag again.

759
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,100
Minghao,

760
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,240
you might

761
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,380
forget it.

762
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,610
You always

763
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,420
ask me to forget it.

764
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,850
But I just can't understand.

765
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,000
Am I not good enough?

766
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,220
Why can't I beat

767
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,490
her distant online boyfriend,

768
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,460
and this brag

769
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,640
who had cheated her for seven years?

770
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,350
During these days,

771
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,570
she was always depressed.

772
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,210
She felt depressed because of that guy.

773
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,390
But why didn't she give up

774
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,400
since he made her

775
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,370
depressed?

776
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,600
I just want to cheer her up.

777
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,210
Am I wrong?

778
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,930
You are not wrong.

779
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,920
I can understand you.

780
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,910
And I can share your feelings.

781
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,680
But whether the illusory online romance

782
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,320
or the cruel real life

783
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,240
is just

784
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,340
superficial

785
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,980
presentation of that.

786
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,240
As on-lookers,

787
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,710
we have no idea about

788
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,630
what touching stories

789
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,770
they ever had.

790
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,910
Even you

791
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,050
are not willing to let it go,

792
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,810
not alone themselves.

793
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,890
You can leave first if you are engaged.

794
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,520
I want to stay alone for a while.

795
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,500
I....

796
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,090
Can, can I?

797
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,920
Then, I'll leave?

798
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,180
You, cheer up.

799
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,280
It's okay.

800
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,590
Happy new year.

801
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,670
Cheer up.

802
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,440
[Bai Lingling's logic]

803
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,350
Noodles are ready. Let me help you.

804
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,760
Why are you so nice to me?

805
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,980
You cried just now, didn't you?

806
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,540
Then can I leave dishes there

807
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,920
if I cry every day?

808
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,230
In your dream.

809
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,460
To be honest,

810
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,020
I know you feel wronged.

811
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,240
But we can't blame

812
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,960
Yang Lanhang for it.

813
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,310
Put yourself in his shoes.

814
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,360
He was then less than ten.

815
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,750
He was good enough

816
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,770
to be that responsible.

817
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,320
So I've said it.

818
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,750
He is a monster.

819
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,110
What if

820
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,030
he had never thought about

821
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,630
bothering you?

822
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,430
He might just want to

823
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,110
guard you out of guilt.

824
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,580
Secretly guard you

825
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,430
and watch you grow up.

826
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,610
Then,

827
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,990
he would leave after the mission is achieved.

828
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,380
He just didn't expect

829
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,980
to desperately

830
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,450
be in love with you.

831
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:45,670
But he,

832
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,720
he can confess it to me

833
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,730
as Yang Lanhang.

834
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,450
Confess to you at that time?

835
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,130
He had just ruined

836
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,010
your graduation thesis defense.

837
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,100
And he told you

838
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,030
he was your distant net friend

839
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,920
who had left without farewell.

840
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,210
According to your personality,

841
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,140
you must get mad at him.

842
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,240
Not as good as this moment.

843
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,750
Who, who told you?

844
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,380
I can forgive him

845
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,890
if he confesses.

846
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,490
Don't you know yourself,

847
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,790
do you?

848
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,590
What about this?

849
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,100
We two

850
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,860
met each other

851
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,330
on the social media.

852
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,340
I actually thought it

853
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,850
a romantic meeting

854
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,190
in a sea of faces.

855
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,340
Then isn't it

856
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,130
a romantic meeting

857
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,310
that you two met on Gate of Heart?

858
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,490
Anyway,

859
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,540
I feel wronged.
