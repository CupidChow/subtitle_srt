00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,740
Not exactly.

180
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,220
But,

181
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,380
but you don't know this.

182
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,020
I'm telling you.

183
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,380
Sometimes you are really inhumane

184
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,900
at work.

185
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,500
Just say it.

186
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,780
What do you want me to do?

187
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,940
I just

188
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,860
have a surprise for you.

189
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,090
It's safe.

190
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,740
This

191
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,460
is a natural Moissanite.

192
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,980
I got it when I studied

193
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,820
in Europe.

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,140
Guess.

195
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,700
How is

196
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,620
a natural Moissanite formed?

197
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,020
So it's not working overtime,

198
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,860
but a pop quiz,

199
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,380
right?

200
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,740
I'll tell you.

201
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,170
A natural Moissanite

202
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,020
is formed in an

203
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,260
impactive environment under high temperature

204
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,260
and high pressure with carbon

205
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,100
and silicon elements needed.

206
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,890
The first person who discovered Moissanite

207
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,660
is a Nobel Prize winner

208
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,660
in France.

209
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,940
His name is Dr. Moissan.

210
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,730
He found the gem in the meteorolite,

211
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,300
so the gem was

212
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,860
named after him.

213
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,780
I was planning to

214
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,540
take this one

215
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,700
back to China

216
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,540
as a seed.

217
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,620
I spent so much time

218
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,020
simulating its growing environment repeatedly.

219
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,220
Finally I managed to cultivate

220
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,900
this high-quality gem.

221
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,260
I intend to

222
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,060
embed it on a ring.

223
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,780
Wait a minute.

224
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,980
Ring?

225
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,370
What...what ring?

226
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,780
An engagement ring.

227
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,140
The gem

228
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,410
grows in

229
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,420
a quite extreme environment,

230
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,380
so it has

231
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,260
a very, very high purity.

232
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,780
Higher than diamonds.

233
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,340
Besides, diamonds are expensive

234
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,380
because their price includes

235
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,340
fees for mining

236
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,010
and workforce,

237
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,900
as well as advertising.

238
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,900
But this gem

239
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
is totally different.

240
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,420
I cultivated it.

241
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
It's a one-off.

242
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,900
This gem

243
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,660
is born just for you.

244
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,580
Right.

245
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,660
How about

246
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,980
giving it a name?

247
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,780
OK?

248
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,860
Let's

249
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,820
follow the naming rule of

250
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,100
Dr. Moissan.

251
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,060
Name it with names.

252
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,380
OK.

253
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,100
Using our names.

254
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,700
Yang.

255
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,540
Baiyang.

256
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,500
Lan.

257
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,690
Bailan.

258
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,340
Ling. How about Linglan?

259
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,620
Linglan.

260
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,780
This sounds great.

261
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,580
You are really good at naming.

262
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,780
You should name

263
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,660
our future kid.

264
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,500
The name of our kid.

265
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,740
So,

266
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,660
are you making a proposal?

267
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,460
No.

268
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,900
I just want to show it to  you

269
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,980
It grows slow,

270
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,020
really slow.

271
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,220
Only one karat in six months.

272
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,540
So I want you to see it first.

273
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,660
And....

274
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,780
What?

275
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,620
Are you eager for it?

276
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,250
No. No.

277
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,350
It does look

278
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,780
a little bit small right now.

279
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,260
Right?

280
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,980
It's fine.

281
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
Wait for it to

282
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,640
-Grow bigger.
-Grow bigger.

283
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,260
Grow bigger.

284
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,700
OK.

285
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,700
Grow slowly.

286
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,140
OK.

287
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,980
Six...six months.

288
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,580
One karat

289
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,100
in six months.

290
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,820
Yang Lanhang proposed to you?

291
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,620
So soon.

292
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,900
It's not a proposal.

293
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,980
He just showed me

294
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,380
the engagement ring.

295
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,500
It's just that

296
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
the gem on the ring,

297
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,970
the rare gem,

298
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,450
is still growing.

299
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,020
Still growing.

300
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,330
So it will take a time

301
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,940
before it completes growing.

302
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,300
But he just

303
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,320
told you his engagement plan

304
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,570
like this?

305
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,060
It's not mysterious at all.

306
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,860
There won't be a surprise.

307
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,940
No.

308
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,620
This surprise is just what I want.

309
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,100
I can accept that,

310
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,220
and I'm very satisfied.

311
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,910
Don't you think

312
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,580
it feels wonderful

313
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,490
when someone makes a proposal

314
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,380
in public?

315
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,580
It enlarges happiness.

316
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,690
It's like

317
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,620
the whole world

318
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,010
is witnessing your happiness.

319
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,560
I can't stand that.

320
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,400
Let me tell you this.

321
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,440
When I was at school,

322
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,580
a boy in the adjacent classroom

323
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,140
had a crush on me.

324
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,170
At 12 o'clock of my birthday,

325
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,980
he called

326
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,700
a dozen of his classmates

327
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,860
to gather in front of my door

328
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,140
and sing a birthday song.

329
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,060
My neighbors came out and kept shouting

330
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,450
'stop singing, what time is it'.

331
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,340
I was so awkward

332
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,660
that I wanted to smash that cake

333
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
into his face.

334
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,700
Later, there was that Wang Tao.

335
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,540
You know it too.

336
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,900
He was really suffocating.

337
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,900
So, not every romance

338
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,090
is good.

339
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,860
A good romance

340
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,780
is the one you like.

341
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,580
Do you understand?

342
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,380
Otherwise,

343
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,500
both will be awkward

344
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,570
in the crowd.

345
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,020
But I

346
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,780
quite like it.

347
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,900
It's fine if you like it.

348
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,980
It's okay as long as you like it.

349
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,100
Everyone has his own preference.

350
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,420
What about

351
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,050
asking Yang Lanhang

352
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,700
to convey my preference?

353
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,420
You want to suggest Ouyang Yifan

354
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,740
making such a proposal?

355
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:57,900
Impossible.

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,270
♫ Neither of us ♫

531
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,740
Anyway, I know during this lifetime,

532
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,460
♫ Wanted to climb over ♫

533
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,620
I won't meet a girl

534
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,760
like you anymore.

535
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,480
♫ I stand on the terrace of your shadow ♫

536
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:17,520
♫ Wind blew and sea rippled ♫

537
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,750
I've never heard

538
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,510
so many words from you.

539
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,830
♫ Everything was exactly covered by memories ♫

540
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,670
I seem to be dreaming.

541
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,830
These matter more than

542
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,680
'I love you'.

543
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,610
If you like,

544
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,390
I can say more in the future.

545
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:47,190
♫ Do we have a blank space between us? ♫

546
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,830
♫ Parted by only one wall ♫

547
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,900
♫ Neither of us wanted to climb over ♫

548
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,130
♫ Wanted to climb over ♫

549
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,800
♫ Wind blew and sea rippled ♫

550
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,210
♫ Everything was ♫

551
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:15,540
♫ Exactly covered by memories ♫

552
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,200
This?

553
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,300
This is

554
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,240
what made me linger for another while.

555
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,200
My luggage has been checked.

556
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,180
Mine too.

557
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,700
I haven't thought about asking you to stay.

558
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,440
You used to follow me.

559
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,880
This time, it's my turn to follow your step.

560
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,960
Xiaoxiao,

561
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,610
peel an orange for you?

562
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,110
Listen to me. For this matter,

563
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,790
it's really not my fault.

564
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,070
Yang Lanhang told me that.

565
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,020
Tonight.

566
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,410
It must be tonight.

567
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,600
Because...

568
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,360
it's easy to have a romantic atmosphere at night.

569
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,970
They must be busy now.

570
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,840
I bet.

571
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,350
What about refining your make-up now?

572
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,180
No. No refining.

573
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,270
We don't need that.

574
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,030
I'll call Yang Lanhang

575
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,580
and make it clear.

576
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,210
Wait a minute.

577
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,340
So annoying.

578
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,600
Buddy,

579
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,980
what are you doing?

580
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,580
She has early put on makeup.

581
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,760
And she's been waiting for the proposal ever since noon.

582
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,100
What time is it now?

583
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,820
Come on.

584
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,630
It's nine o'clock.

585
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,380
Can't you

586
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,190
change a store to buy the ring?

587
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,330
Xiaoxiao,

588
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,420
this....

589
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,020
Xiaoxiao,

590
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,460
it's like this.

591
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
I've brought my ID card.

592
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,960
And household register as well.

593
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,340
[A man can only buy one throughout his life.]

594
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,270
Why can't these

595
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,150
show my identity?

596
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,050
Why don't you sell it to me?

597
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,480
Of course we can.

598
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,110
But....

599
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,620
I hate the 'but'.

600
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,010
Once in a lifetime.

601
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,690
I only want a diamond ring from your store.

602
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,280
Lady,

603
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,000
please sell this ring to me.

604
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,520
I'm going to make a proposal.

605
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,740
I can tell your determination.

606
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,300
But this one is a sample.

607
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,350
To make sure

608
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,650
that every diamond ring we sell

609
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,950
can bring perfectly beautiful memory

610
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,500
and unforgettable experience

611
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,800
to our customers,

612
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,570
you need to make an order

613
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,870
within 15 to 20 days

614
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,420
ahead of schedule.

615
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,350
But sir,

616
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,310
believe me,

617
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,870
it's worth the wait.

618
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:54,980
Alright.

619
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,570
I'll order now.

620
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,710
Is it okay to make an order now?

621
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:04,640
[A man can only buy one throughout his life.]

622
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,380
Okay.

623
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,430
But could you please be quicker?

624
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,810
Okay.

625
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,280
Identity documents please.

626
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,250
Are you a pig?

627
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,310
You can't make a proposal

628
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,570
since you didn't get a ring?

629
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:23,790
I,

630
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,380
I....

631
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,350
Are, are you kidding me?

632
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,780
I,

633
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,000
Ouyang Yifan,

634
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,340
only date

635
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,610
but never step into the tomb of marriage.

636
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,860
What about being paired with me?

637
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,590
What do you mean?

638
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,520
I'm making a proposal.

639
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,630
Love is not a grand confession

640
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,150
or something like stars or moon.

641
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,670
Love is something about beginner's luck.

642
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,610
Sometimes

643
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,120
you will meet a guy

644
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,260
who feels the same as you.

645
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,150
But sometimes,

646
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,290
you are not that lucky.

647
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,560
But I believe

648
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,160
one day

649
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,000
you will encounter a guy

650
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,520
who really appreciates you.

651
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,380
With seven billion people

652
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,320
on Earth,

653
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
I know

654
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,850
there will be one

655
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,050
who is perfectly ready to

656
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,470
climb onto the moon for you.

657
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,990
Climb onto the moon for you.

658
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,390
There will be one

659
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,740
who is perfectly ready to

660
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,150
climb onto the moon for you.

661
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,940
Don't you play mahjong?

662
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,160
You're reading lines here.

663
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,380
You wanna be an actor?

664
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,060
You're thinly clad.

665
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,410
You heard it?

666
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,180
Climb onto the moon for you.

667
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,550
I need to prepare a program for the new year's party.

668
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,640
They asked me to recite something.

669
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,980
It's really outdated. Really.

670
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,410
I find myself a piece of

671
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,740
classical movie lines.

672
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,700
Okay. Okay.

673
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,370
You're so great.

674
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,300
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

675
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,100
Is it fashionable?

676
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,520
Yes. Yes. Let's go.

677
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,410
Where are we going?

678
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,410
Ouyang Yifan

679
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:35,880
finally got

680
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,180
his diamond ring.

681
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,740
He was going to make a fantastic proposal

682
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,130
that Xiaoxiao dreamed of

683
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,050
to make up for her.

684
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,310
But Xiaoxiao has said it.

685
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,410
It can't be a surprise anyway.

686
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:45,910
We might as well

687
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,300
have a party

688
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,220
to celebrate

689
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,100
the coming new year.

690
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,870
She specially asked me to pick you up.

691
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,250
Go.

692
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,630
He finally got the ring.

693
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,280
Congratulations to him. It's been a long way.

694
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,520
Hello?

695
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,830
We're going to start off.

696
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,660
Canceled?

697
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,690
You can't blame me.

698
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,500
Of course, you are more innocent.

699
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,810
Early in this morning,

700
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,310
it was reported that the epidemic

701
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,610
hit Wuhan.

702
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,110
So I totally agree

703
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,050
to cancel it.

704
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,520
Otherwise,

705
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,400
it must be dangerous

706
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,620
with so many people together.

707
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,540
Right?

708
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,690
Come on.

709
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,840
Don't be mad. Have something sweet

710
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,640
to nourish your skin and vitality.

711
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,370
You don't understand me

712
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,420
at all.

713
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm not mad at the canceled proposal.

714
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,490
I got mad because you delayed

715
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,670
so much on buying a ring.

716
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,390
Or we might have early

717
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,520
finished the wedding ceremony.

718
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,370
Have something sweet.

719
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,150
Why are we eating sweet dumplings on an ordinary day?

720
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,450
Put it here. I'll eat by myself.

721
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,720
Why is the electricity off?

722
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,820
You should go check

723
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,160
if there's a blackout in the estate.

724
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,520
And I'll go check

725
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,070
the circuit.

726
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,270
Alright.

727
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,990
♫ Honey ♫

728
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,080
♫ I don't intend to be silent ♫

749
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,780
What are you doing?

750
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,909
Although we met a special case

751
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,270
and time was limited,

752
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,520
I know that you've been

753
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,100
eager for a proposal

754
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,010
witnessed by our friends.

755
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,600
So I invite all of you

756
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,790
to witness this.

757
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,050
Wow.

758
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,230
So romantic.

759
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,199
So thoughtful.

760
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,989
So thoughtful.

761
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,210
Guan Xiaoyu,

762
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,989
I love you.

763
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,429
Will you marry me?

764
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,060
Say yes.

765
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,250
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

766
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,550
-Say yes.
-Marry Him.

767
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,960
-Marry Him.
-Say yes.

768
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,250
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

769
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,030
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

770
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,710
-Say yes.N-Marry Him.

771
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,430
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

772
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,910
Say yes.

773
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,830
Moustache!

774
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,130
Why are you here?

775
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,000
Buddy,

776
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,470
what kind of tire do you want to change?

777
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,650
Sir,

778
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,170
do you have tires

779
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,650
that are good at gripping the ground.

780
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,250
I mean, I want to drive on snow.

781
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,860
We do.

782
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,780
We have best

783
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,750
snow tire.

784
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,090
What, buddy?

785
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,180
You are going to northeast China?

786
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,120
Return home for the new year?

787
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:20,750
Yes.

788
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,090
My wife comes from northeast China.

789
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,310
This is my first time to

790
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,360
pay a New Year call to my mother-in-law.

791
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,580
I have to make some preparation, right?

792
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,870
Okay, relax.

793
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,910
I'll take step for you.

794
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,190
Alright. Alright. Thanks.

795
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,410
[Wuhan has declared its lockdown today.]

796
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,950
I've checked the scheme. Pretty good.

797
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,430
We should attach great importance to disinfection.

798
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,990
Above all,

799
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,620
entrances, wash rooms and staircase

800
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,300
need someone specially assigned to take charge.

801
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,310
What's more,

802
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,400
I've discussed it

803
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,580
with the board of directors.

804
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,260
We should limit the customers from tomorrow.

805
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,650
Shut down the entrance in the north and east.

806
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,670
Set up electronic thermometers.

807
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,110
And meanwhile, make full preparation.

808
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,720
If necessary,

809
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,210
we will temporally shut down.

810
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,900
You've worked overtime

811
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,270
to design marketing schemes

812
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,460
for Spring Festival.

813
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,460
You did a good job.

814
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,520
But we have no other choices.

815
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,580
Whatever loss

816
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,380
is not a patch

817
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,140
on customers' safety.

818
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,620
Alright. Alright.

819
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,930
Stop here.

820
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,260
Communicate without delay

821
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,890
if you have any problem.

822
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,260
I'll see you home

823
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,480
after we picked up grandma.

824
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,910
I'm going to the hospital to check something.

825
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,300
What's wrong?

826
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,070
The clinical test is still in observation period.

827
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,410
Now that the epidemic is so serious,

828
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,630
I should take a look.

829
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,900
Then I'll

830
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,910
go with you.

831
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,060
Alright.

832
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,180
Actually,

833
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,400
there are not

834
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,990
many cases in our city.

835
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,170
I think as long as

836
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,680
the hospital quarantines

837
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,900
inpatient wards right,

838
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,990
there wouldn't be any problems.

839
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,010
Don't worry too much.

840
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,580
Qingyi,

841
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,130
you kid,

842
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,010
haven't you bought

843
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,360
the flight ticket home, have you?

844
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,580
Why are you still here?

845
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,680
I made a hasty decision

846
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,980
that I would not go back.

847
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,370
Why?

848
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,560
I'm going to spend

849
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,530
my autumn of Polkino

850
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,830
in the lab.

851
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,010
Autumn of Polkino?

852
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,450
Once,

853
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,760
when Pushkin went to Polkino to have some affairs,

854
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,070
he happened to meet an epidemic.

855
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,040
The village was locked.

856
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,350
And he was trapped there for three months.

857
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,330
But surprisingly, he was enlightened

858
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,340
and finished four plays,

859
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,810
more than 30 poems

860
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,620
and one and a half novels.

861
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,220
We called it the autumn of Polkino.

862
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,900
Anyway,

863
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,710
I will definitely

864
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,100
get rich inspiration

865
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,780
during this Spring Festival.

866
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,170
Maybe I would look totally different

867
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,860
when you meet me next time.

868
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,030
Qingyi,

869
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,380
what happened?

870
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,680
Are you okay?

871
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,030
Wuhan was locked.

872
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,920
I can't go back.

873
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,410
It's time for us

874
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,380
to think about

875
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,560
what we can do.

876
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,830
From the perspective of materials science,

877
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,180
maybe we can start from

878
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,110
medical protective

879
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,990
equipment.

880
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,060
I have something

881
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,120
to show you.

882
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,760
When I was a postgraduate,

883
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,720
I was studying metamaterial,

884
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
right?

885
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,500
It was reported these days that

886
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,130
medical supplies are quite short.

887
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,060
I am thinking

888
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,650
whether we can invent

889
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,580
a new material

890
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,130
for protection suits.

891
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,100
Not only should it

892
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,270
have good physical and mechanical properties

893
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,290
like being strongly resistant against breakage,

894
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,760
but I wish it is good at

895
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,360
exhaust of moisture.

896
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,490
It would be better

897
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,460
if it can be recycled.

898
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,130
In this way,

899
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,840
I think we can

900
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,850
solve the short supply

901
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,820
and something else

902
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,870
brought by consumption of

903
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,760
one-time protection suits

904
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,720
and production cycle

905
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,230
more efficiently.

906
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,540
What's more,

907
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,260
the cost of medical waste disposal

908
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,150
can be greatly cut.

909
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,930
Good job, Lingling.

910
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,440
You've prepared so much

911
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,700
for it.

912
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,540
Actually,

913
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,430
I think this idea

914
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,110
not mature enough.

915
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,870
So I didn't mean to tell you.

916
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:16,920
But

917
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,730
no one

918
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,370
expected that the epidemic is so sudden and serious.

919
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,790
Maybe we can

920
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,590
cooperate with

921
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,440
Huaihai University

922
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,610
to make further research on this.

923
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,420
Then we should start off now.

924
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,260
Come on.

925
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,350
Time waits for no one.

926
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,780
Don't you go home?

927
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,460
You were going to pay a visit to your mother-in-law, weren't you?

928
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,520
My wife has a clear estimation of righteousness.

929
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,780
She will understand me.

930
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,270
Then we should join you.

931
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,210
Why are you two back?

932
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,760
For experts on physics and dynamics,

933
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,780
I am the best person, right?

934
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,500
You're right anyway.

935
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,010
But we somehow miss the time

936
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,100
when you were silent.

937
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,080
The moment we knew the news,

938
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,720
we bought flight tickets home.

939
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,230
An accident happened at home.

940
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,700
Of course we should come back.

941
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:03,920
Yes.

942
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:05,850
Okay.

943
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,110
Now everyone is here.

944
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,830
Let's move out!
