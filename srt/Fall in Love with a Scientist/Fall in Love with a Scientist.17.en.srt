00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,170
Seniors, come on.

353
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,480
Is that

354
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,900
Yang Lanhang?

355
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,990
What about this, Yang?

356
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,290
Have a game?

357
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,290
No.

358
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,770
Don't go in a rush, Yang.

359
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,380
Or I should call you Forever is for Ever?

360
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,550
I'm the designer of Gate of Heart.

361
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,140
It's not that hard for me

362
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,700
to get a user's data.

363
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,460
What do you want?

364
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,070
Just a game.

365
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,990
What about this?

366
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,170
One to one.

367
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,180
If you win, I'll keep the secret to you.

368
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,800
What if I lose?

369
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,230
Don't be that pessimistic.

370
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,940
The game hasn't begun yet.

371
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,950
You have the chance to win.

372
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:24,830
Come on.

373
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,470
Okay. Okay.

374
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,350
Enough. Enough.

375
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,860
Let's go. Let's go.

376
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,370
Why are we leaving?

377
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,750
What a rare game!

378
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,550
We'll watch it.

379
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,740
Okay.

380
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,060
An one-to-one game.

381
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,080
Seniors, come on.

382
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,290
Seniors!

383
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,130
Come on!

384
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,970
Seniors!

385
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,600
Come on!

386
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,650
Seniors!

387
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,700
Come on!

388
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,290
Seniors!

389
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,260
Come on!

390
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:57,850
Seniors!

391
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,980
Come on!

392
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,740
Seniors, come on!

393
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,260
Seniors!

394
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,190
Come on!

395
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,980
Seniors!

396
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,860
Come on!

397
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,920
Bravo!

398
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,150
One more! One more!

399
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:38,920
Let's go.

400
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,470
Look.

401
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,830
Yang Lanhang is so bad at basketball.

402
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,920
Everybody has his strong points.

403
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,880
You know, he has his strong points.

404
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:45,640
Seniors!

405
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,520
Come on!

406
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,240
Seniors!

407
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Come on!

408
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,040
Seniors!

409
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,430
Come on!

410
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,610
Look.

411
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,590
Zheng Minghao is so cool!

412
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,440
Seniors, come on!

413
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,020
What's wrong?

414
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,910
Yang.

415
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,550
Yang, are you okay?

416
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,140
Yang Lanhang?

417
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,450
What, Yang?

418
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,410
You're so weak.

419
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,470
What are you saying?

420
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,360
Bring me to the hospital.

421
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,330
Okay. Okay. Bring you to the hospital.

422
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,850
You hurry. Hurry up.

423
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,980
I...I'll call a taxi.

424
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,950
You support him up.

425
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,580
I, I'll call a taxi.

426
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:56,870
Take it.

427
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,460
Okay. Okay.

428
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,170
Then I'll go.

429
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,400
Come on.

430
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,200
I'll fetch your suit.

431
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600
Why should a man pretend to be fragile?

432
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,210
Lingling,

433
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,800
have a seat.

434
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,730
He'll be okay.

435
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,820
Why are you back?

436
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,920
I saw Guan Xiaoyu's

437
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,020
official account

438
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,070
which was about teaching love experience

439
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,910
now sent articles

440
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,290
about valve materials every day

441
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,130
and got

442
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,310
less and less readers.

443
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,730
I knew something must have gone wrong.

444
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,290
So I came back to lend you a hand.

445
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,430
Even I can't help.

446
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,650
What can you do?

447
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,610
Gate of Heart now

448
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,660
has more than 700,000

449
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,090
users.

450
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,390
You can see our advertisements

451
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,490
in many bus stations.

452
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,700
How many subscribers

453
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,840
does your official account have?

454
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,730
What are you saying?

455
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,650
OK.

456
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,370
-No. He belittled my official account...! 
-Shh.

457
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,930
We're in the hospital.

458
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,730
Let's discuss it after we are out.

459
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,730
I'll reprove him when out.

460
00:21:59,410 --> 00:21:59,950
Lingling,

461
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,720
the logo of

462
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,720
Gate of Heart

463
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,940
is a heart anyway.

464
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,710
I've discussed it with Dong Chao.

465
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,720
On the page of downloading,

466
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,320
we'll add a piece of

467
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,380
five-second animation about valve.

468
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,850
If you click,

469
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,440
you will jump to a page with more information.

470
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,580
Besides,

471
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,420
the company's cooperation

472
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,760
with those celebrities

473
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,270
on Weibo this month

474
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,320
will all

475
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,410
be left to you.

476
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,140
Then, what should you do?

477
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,280
Relax.

478
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,660
Our users

479
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,670
are getting stable.

480
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,680
We won't have a loss.

481
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,570
Not bad.

482
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,960
More than that.

483
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
After reading your articles,

484
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,070
I've completed the animation.

485
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,700
Clean yourself up.

486
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,740
All right.

487
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,830
I already know what you want to say.

488
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,840
Don't tell me that.

489
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,270
I must tell you.

490
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,530
Why did you play basketball?

491
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,660
Do you wanna kill yourself?

492
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,590
I'm fine now.

493
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,640
Fine?

494
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,030
Your physical condition is very bad.

495
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,870
You should pay attention to your health.

496
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,280
For Bai Lingling again, huh?

497
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:24,960
No.

498
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,810
For myself.

499
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,530
You might not know that

500
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,370
I actually liked basketball

501
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,630
since my childhood.

502
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,220
I even dreamed of playing a basketball match,

503
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,060
a basketball match.

504
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,830
But everyone told me that

505
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,630
I shouldn't play basketball

506
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,930
because it's too dangerous for me.

507
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,480
So I could just listen to their shouts of joy

508
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,490
outside the athletic field

509
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,040
and practice the act of shooting

510
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,090
by myself.

511
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,440
I think it's

512
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,280
pretty good for me

513
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,750
to accomplish my dream

514
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,050
at this age.

515
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,310
I'm so happy.

516
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,070
Don't try to move me.

517
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,330
We'll soon conduct clinical trials.

518
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,680
You can play as much as you want

519
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,230
after this research.

520
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,590
In short, before the start of the trial

521
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,470
you should restrain your desire.

522
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,660
Did the guy you played

523
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,540
basketball with show up?

524
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,090
I think he is outside.

525
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,910
Doctor Li!

526
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,290
Are you all right?

527
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,720

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,920
and our clinical trials

702
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,010
are about to start.

703
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,690
But I am still

704
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,670
a little uneasy.

705
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,100
I heard from Doctor Li that

706
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,780
you are also worried about the

707
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,130
timeliness of the valve, right?

708
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,270
Actually, I have an assumption.

709
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,820
But I don't know whether it will work or not.

710
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,210
Just tell me.

711
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,810
Here's what I think.

712
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,580
I want to change the environment in which the valve is grown

713
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,420
from the lab to the human body.

714
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,940
Go on.

717
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,840
Why did granny go to the hospital?

718
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,960
Why did you boast to me!

719
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:22,840
Really.

720

You said I had no son,

721
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,710
and I had no smart phone.

722
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,100
You have a son,

723
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,070
but the hospital

724
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,830
contacted the nursing home and found out that

725
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,630
your son didn't pay the bill

726
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,110

So stubborn.

730
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,250
What's the condition?

Granny.

732
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,240
It was Mrs. Zhang who was sick.

733
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,540
She signed up

734
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,220
for our clinical trials.

735
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,980

739
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,960
she was waiting for the 3D print

740
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,390
when her valve shape was confirmed.

741
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,740
But the nurse found out

742
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,620
just now that the guardian's

743
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,680
signature was forged.

744
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,980
So can you get in touch with your family now?

745
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,280
We can't.

746
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,160
There's no way

747
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,960
she could be in a clinical trial

748
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,220
in such a condition.

749
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,110
But the old lady didn't

750
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,870
cooperate with the advice we gave her.

751
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,830
She was so anxious that

752
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,010
it triggered an acute myocardial infarction.

753
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,270
It was lucky that your granny was with her.

754
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,950
She called an ambulance and

755
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,660
came with her.

756
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,100
Is she okay?

759

Granny Wu has heart failure.

760
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,200
She must have operated right away

761
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,210
and changed her valve.

762
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,600
But here's the thing.

763
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,520
For one thing, we didn't get

764
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,700
permission from her family.

765
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,920

768
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,440
So there's no way to

769
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,540
conduct clinical trials.

770
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,510
We should save her life.

What about common valves?

772
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,580
Mrs. Zhang told us that

773
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,340
her son was

774
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,890
unwilling to bear the cost of the surgery.

775
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,280
She signed up because she heard that

776
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,540
our experiment can provide free

777
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,300
treatment and free care.

778
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,070
Her surgery can proceed as long as

779
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,660
her guardian can be found.

780
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,940
So you want to use Plan B?

781
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,090
What's Plan B?

782
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,020
Plan B is what you

783
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,820
came up with before,

784
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,950
to change the cultivating environment

785
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,800
from the lab into human body.

786
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,120
Actually, it was Lingling who

787
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,380
put forward this at the earliest.

788
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:14,639
She said,

789
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,150
if the patient is in a critical condition

790
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,909
and needs an immediate valve replacement surgery,

791
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:17,790
he or she wouldn't have time to wait

792
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,300
for the valve to form outside the body.

793
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,060
How can we solve this problem?

794
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,360
I didn't have

795
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,280
a better idea

796
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,120
when she asked me.

797
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,260
But later I found that

798
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,310
we can actually take the environment

799
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,489
of valve culture

800
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,000
from the lab into the human body.

801
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,139
Because the human body

802
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,480
is already the best bioreactor.

803
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,659
That's to say,

804
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
to implant the printed stent

805
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,920
into the heart.

806
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,139
In the early stage,

807
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,070
the stent performs the function of the valve

808
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,750
and supports the heart beats normally,

809
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,130
and the cells are growing during this period.

810
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,360
Later, the scaffold begins to degrade,

811
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,489
at which point the cells have grown

812
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,560
into the valve shape we need

813
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,500
to keep the heart

814
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,870
functioning properly.

815
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,570
Lingling,

816
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,489
is that what you thought

817
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,290
to be?

818
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,870
It's a little too hard to pull it off.

819
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,630
Yes.

820
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,770
The plan sounds impressive.

821
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:58,950
But how can we grab

822
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,120
the cells and let them

823
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,180
reproduce on the

824
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,810
scaffold?

825
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,620
This is just a conception of mine,

826
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,550
so I don't want to make a fuss.

It's no wonder that Ouyang

830
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,140

00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,740
Because he is the youngest and I am the weakest.

874
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,130
Only we two should be assigned to do it.

875
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,440
It's impossible to let Professor Jiang do it.

876
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,080
But

877
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,710
I'm kind of confused this time, too.

878
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,970
That wimpy kid keeps

879
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,910
saying that he's a genius

880
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,590
and would like to take part in

881
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,010
the most core work,

882
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,070
and he'd definitely fight with guru one day.

883
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,120
I can't believe

884
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,340
he took the initiative

885
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,020
to do something so marginal this time.

886
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,530
But in my view,

887
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,540
this granny

888
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,430
just can't afford surgery

889
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,350
so she's willing to

890
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,320
participate in the clinical trial.

891
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,790
She wants to cure her disease for free.

892
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,090
Instead of acting like chickens

893
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,350
with their heads cut off

894
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,570
and finding her son all over the world,

895
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,380
I think it'd be better if we chip in

896
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,090
and get the old lady to

897
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,640
have her surgery done.

898
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,540
My granny

899
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,380
thinks so.

900
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,650
But Mrs. Zhang is too

901
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,960
stubborn to agree with it.

902
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,160
[Zhai Qingyi]

903
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:58,910
Hello.

904
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,790
OK. OK. I'll go right now.

905
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,260
What's wrong?

906
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,150
He found her son.

907
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,160
So soon?

908
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,090
I have to go.

909
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,860
Be careful.

910
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,820
Watch the road!

911
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,410
OK.

912
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,400
This kid is capable.

913
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,400
What do you mean?

914
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,120
You should give us an explanation.

915
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,350
How exactly do you want to treat her?

916
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,500
I've told you so many times that

917
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,590
I won't agree the surgery.

918
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,520
She is too old

919
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,570
have surgery.

920
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,490
What should I do if

921
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,040
any unexpected misfortune happens to her.

922
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,480
But I want to cure...

923
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,250
Young man,

924
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,560
you are not the one who

925
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,820
gets ill.

926
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,090
I think you're just afraid that

927
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,640
if your mom's gonna cured and

928
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,820
live longer,

929
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,620
you won't get the property.

930
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,640
Conservative treatment?

931
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,600
Nonsense.

932
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,700
You're just waiting for her to die.

933
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,000
Don't slander me!

934
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,310
Am I right?

935
00:38:59,310 --> 00:38:59,640
Just stop talking.

936
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,480
Am I right?

937
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,070
Stop.

938
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,570
Am I right?

939
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,250
Mr. Zhang?

940
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:02,960
Don't be angry.

941
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,510
Let me introduce briefly.

942
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,480
We have two treatment

943
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,490
options.

944
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,040
The first one is

945
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,760
to implant biological valves

946
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,860
or mechanical valves.

947
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,650
Both technologies

948
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,540
are relatively mature

949
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,380
with low risks.

950
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:13,840
And the cost is between

951
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,730
50,000 and 150,000 yuan.

952
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,650
Another option is

953
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,040
the clinical program that

954
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,130
your mother forged

955
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,230
your signature to join.

956
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,780
It's a new technology,

957
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,300
so there may be some risks.

958
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,980
But it's totally free

959
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,240
and the subsequent fees will also be involved.

960
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,460
That's to say,

961
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,430
it wouldn't cost a cent.

962
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:30,930
Yes.

963
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,110
Then we'll choose this one.

964
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,650
OK.

965
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,680
Look, look!

966
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,730
What did I say?

967
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,020
You raised a son for nothing.

968
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,040
Ungrateful person.

969
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,220
Guru! Guru!

970
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,440
Can't you walk slowly?

971
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,280
You scared us.

972
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,450
Guru,

973
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,640
I just saw a volunteer on the list

974
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,440
who has the same name as you.

975
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,660
I took another look specially

976
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,420
and found that you two have the same

977
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,380
ID number and birthday.

978
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,600
Isn't it a coincidence?

979
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,510
I have an electronic version.

980
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,560
Here.

981
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,280
OK. OK. I don't need that.

982
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,200
That person....

983
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,340
That's me.

984
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,480
What?

985
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,080
You?!

986
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,440
It's you, guru?

987
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,740
Why?

988
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,020
Guru,

989
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,360
I can understand your feelings.

990
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,280
This project

991
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,250
is just like your child.

992
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,800
You're willing to pay everything for it.

993
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,690
I'd also like to sign up

994
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,780
if it's needed.

995
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,210
But,

996
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,810
it's meaningless.

997
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,950
Healthy people like us

998
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,140
are not qualified to participate in clinical trials.

999
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,320
We have no no scientific value.

1000
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,060
I'm not like you.

1001
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,400
I have congenital

1002
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,170
aortic insufficiency.

1003
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,110
I didn't get treatment when I was a kid,

1004
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,910
because at that time

1005
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,340
I was still growing up.

1006
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,730
The artificial valve couldn't

1007
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,570
grow gradually

1008
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,410
larger

1009
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,540
with my body

1010
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,220
Also, it wasn't too serious

1011
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,060
at that time.

1012
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:06,940
So I chose to

1013
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,290
protect it carefully.

1014
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,600
After I grow up, I can replace my valve.

1015
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,070
But I think the valve material

1016
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,610
not good enough.

1017
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,970
So I wanna

1018
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,050
study it by myself.

1019
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,970
I'll have the surgery

1020
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,360
as soon as the study is successfully completed.

1021
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,680
I've succeeded, right?

1022
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,660
Take it easy. I am a genius.

1023
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:25,880
I'll live.

1024
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,560
You can just buy a new one

1025
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,580
if there is something wrong with the heart.

1026
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,380
Your mom won't die.

00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,190
I'm a genius.

1046
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,950
♫ Is fair ♫

1047
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,280
♫ Is it ♫

1048
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,490
♫ Rainy or sunny in your place? ♫

1049
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,780
♫ Or parted by the Pacific ♫

1050
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,460
♫ It's actually night-time there ♫

1051
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,300
♫ Then I wish you gentle starlight ♫

1052
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,080
♫ In your beautiful dream ♫

1053
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,090
♫ Days with your favor ♫

1054
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,070
♫ And nights eager for your hug ♫

1055
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,380
♫ You treasure me so well ♫

1056
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:51,080
♫ That I don't need to strive to be strong ♫

1057
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,800
Stop looking at me like that.

1058
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,110
Just go. Let's have a meal.

1059
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,250
♫ We can share time ♫

1060
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,490
We can talk about it during the meal.

1061
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,390
♫ And moonlight as well ♫

1062
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,770
♫ I want to be with you ♫

1063
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,810
Hello, Doctor Li.

1064
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,490
♫ Forever with you ♫

1065
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,640
[He is not brave enough.]

1066
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,470
[Day One]

1067
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,730
Confess!

1068
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,830
I must confess tomorrow.

1069
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,100
[Day Two]

1070
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,470
After the confession,

1071
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,440
maybe I could kiss her

1072
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,740
fair and square.

1073
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,550
[Day N]

1074
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,700
I should confess today!
