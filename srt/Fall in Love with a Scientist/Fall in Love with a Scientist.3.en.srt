what... what experiment, Professor?

Are you nuts?

12
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,260
Was that

13
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,340
your elder sister?

14
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,020
Is it a war between sisters?

15
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,300
Fighting for family possessions or a man?

16
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,579
That's not my sister. She's my mom.

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,990
We are very busy today.

699
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,830
I'm so tired.

700
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,630
Let's take a break.

701
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,470
Drink some water.

[Resume of Bai Lingling]

703
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,430
OK.

704
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,920
My back hurts.

705
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,820
Professor,

706
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,210
we have selected the whole afternoon

707
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,890
but none of them are qualified.

708
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,820
I think

709
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,870
your questions

710
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,560
could be too difficult for them.

711
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,690
If we go on like this,

712
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,080
there would be only two people left in the lab,

713
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,550
me and Lanhang.

714
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,520
Professor,

715
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,740
what I mean is,

716
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,130
our lab needs some

717
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,390
fresh blood.

718
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,520
What do you think?

719
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,950
What you said is reasonable.

720
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,420
The questions we asked might be

721
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,220
too difficult.

722
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,310
Next,

723
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,700
we can ask some easier questions.

724
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:03,370
Sure.

725
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:03,870
Is that okay?

726
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,540
OK.

727
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,260
Then you ask the questions.

728
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,270
Me?

729
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,650
All right, we will be the quizzer.

730
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm a little nervous.

731
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,540
I'm also nervous.

732
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,540

[Forever is for Ever]

734
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,219
I can regard those people I'm afraid of

735
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,909
as cabbage,

736
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,880
then I will feel relieved.

737
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,470
I said eggplant,

738
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,600
not cabbage.

739
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,920
[Forever is for Ever]

740
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,370
I can't make a fool of you.

741
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,800
You are pretty sober now.

742
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,110
Of course!

743
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,370
I love cabbage so much.

744
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,040
So I can't stand groundless

745
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,550
slander against the cabbage.

Good afternoon, dear teachers.

755
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,510
Good afternoon.

756
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,190
I was so intense just now.

757
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,910
You really come here.

758
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,510
Professor,

759
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,890
I don't catch your meaning.

760
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,820
Look.

761
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,960
you didn't allow my graduate application.

762
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,050
Over the next half year,

763
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,140
I can't go anywhere else

764
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,860
before I hand over my thesis.

765
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,160
I, myself,

766
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,100
I love materials science very much.

767
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,100
I'm full of vigor.

768
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,490
I'd like to use all the knowledge I have learned

769
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,290
to get permission to work in the lab.

770
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,970
I'll devote my life

771
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,020
to the lab!

772
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,230
Sit down please.

773
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,620
Let's get right to the point.

774
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,550
Let's talk about some professional topics.

775
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,600
Okay.

776
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,670
Then I'll ask you some questions.

777
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,840
Could you please give us a brief illustration

778
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,630
about the preparation method

779
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,700

780
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,190
Bai Lingling,

781
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,830
is that what you said

782
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,710
'love materials science

783
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,800
and full of vigor'?

784
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,900
Professor,

785
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,420
let me change another way to ask.

786
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,390
That's okay.

787
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,950
I, I don't remember the method of...

788
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,250
But I know,

789
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,140
the number was not 1.5, it's 3.

790
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,080
I wrote it by mistake.

791
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,090
Yang,

792
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,890
the data you put forward was right.

793
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,890
I blame you wrongly.

794
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,410
I shouldn't play pranks either.

795
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,100
I originally

796
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,470
want to find a chance

797
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,690
to apologize to you.

798
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,580
You can choose not to forgive me

799
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,260
or refuse my application

800
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,390
to the lab.

801
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,560
You can tell me straight.

802
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,200
You told us you have

803
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,210
known that you were wrong.

804
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,890
Is that your attitude to apologize?

805
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,230
You are not worth to be taught!

806
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,290
You can leave now.

807
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm so sorry.

808
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,950
Thank you for your time.

809
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,130
Good bye.

810
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,720
Bai Lingling,

811
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,950
I didn't mean that.

812
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,120
I want to apologize to you

813
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,380
if I offended you.

814
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,990
You are welcome, Yang.

815
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,790
I don't like materials science

at all.

817

I came to this major

818
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,430
because my grade was not high enough

819
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,570
and I was adjusted.

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,250

824
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,250

to ask some easy questions?

827
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,390
Did you want to embarrass her deliberately

828
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,530
just because she

829
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,340
called you eggplant?

I didn't!

I wanted to ask her some

832

easy questions, but I have never

833
