OK.

175
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,310
It's Zheng Minghao's clothes that you washed?

176
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,940
You found out.

177
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,260
I told him that you wouldn't buy it,

178
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,420
but he insisted to

179
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
make a complete show,

180
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,850
and that details are important.

181
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
I got it when you said

182
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,180
you would go to

183
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,940
the dry-cleaning shop.

184
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,020
And details？

185
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,380
Normally,

186
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,890
your clothes will be

187
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,179
sent home

188
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,299
by the shop.

189
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,140
How could you go to the dry-cleaning shop by yourself?

190
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,970
Yes, you do know me well.

191
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,299
We do have the privity.

192
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,620
And why do I

193
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,970
help Zheng Minghao?

194
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,220
Because I think

195
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,340
he is a good guy.

196
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,020
Lingling,

197
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,300
what about giving him a chance?

198
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,820
I'm not good enough for him.

199
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,260
Why?

200
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,300
What are you talking about?

201
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,100
Since you have already

202
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,940
put that guy in the blacklist,

203
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,780
a new life

204
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,660
should begin.

205
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,980
It's really been a long time before you come back.

206
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,890
You actually got lost here.

207
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:05,820
Come on.

208
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,020
This is your new home.

209
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,500
The department is only

210
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,290
two kilometers away from your school.

211
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,100
It's a quiet place in the hustle and bustle.

212
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,540
Convenience store and restaurants are downstairs.

213
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,610
It's convenient to buy things and have meals.

214
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,700
The important thing is,

215
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,060
this is all decorated by me.

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,420
Can you feel the grace from

217
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,780
the simplicity

218
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,620
and the warmth

219
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,300
from the style?

220
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,220
I saw her today.

221
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,410
Who?

222
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,860
My first love, the net friend.

223
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,220
You could meet her even when you were lost?

224
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:44,980
It seems that

225
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,020
you do have some link.

226
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,460
But I saw some intimacy

227
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,660
between her and

228
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,060
some other guy.

229
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,780
Probably...

230
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,540
I said that

231
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,690
she must have a boyfriend.

232
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,460
Hang,

233
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
we cannot do this

234
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,780
to be the third party.

235
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,220
Of course I won't be

236
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,610
a third party.

237
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,230
It's like the meeting this time

238
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,260
is not a romance.

239
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,180
It's a warning of God.

240
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,460
It's the destiny.

241
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,420
Listen to me. You give up.

242
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,820
Just probably.

243
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,380
There is still

244
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,620
a 50% chance。

245
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,700
Why are you still here?

246
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,380
I,

247
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,300
The moment I arrived home,

248
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,580
I heard you were lost

249
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,580
and rushed here.

250
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,540
Don't you want to chat some more with me?

251
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,980
No, I'm tired.

252
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,940
Go back and have an early rest.

253
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,940
Actually,

254
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,410
I decided to run away from home abruptly.

255
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,740
Can I sleep here

256
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,580
tonight?

257
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,260
I know you will definitely

258
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,980
not let me down.

259
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,050
I will take a shower first.

260
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,060
Take your time.

261
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,380
Right,

262
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,450
have a good look of the software

263
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,420
I downloaded for you just now.

264
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,960
[Gate of Heart]

265
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,260
It's all done.

266
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,620
Dong Chao sent a message

267
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,570
in the group chat,

268
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,940
saying that he developed an app

269
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,140
with Zheng Minghao,

270
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,580
and invited us to download it

271
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,500
to voice support for it.

272
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,020
OK.

273
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,100
What's the name of it?

274
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,460
Gate of Heart, I have already downloaded it.

275
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,060
OK. Let me have a look.

276
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,140
The one he sent to the group chat?

277
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,940
Right, right.

278
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,770
[Gate of Heart]

279
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,300
OK, downloading.

280
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,460
I'm going to bed.

281
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,620
Why do you go to bed so early?

282
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,780
Shouldn't we take a good

283
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,340
look at the stuff

284
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
our old classmates made

285
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,980
and evaluate it?

286
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,860
Isn't it okay to download it

287
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,100
and show my support?

288
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,210
Do I need to play it?

289
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,520
What if it is not good?

290
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,330
We can make a little suggestion

291
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,580
to them.

292
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,500
Is it necessary?

293
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,660
Certainly.

294
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,140
Have a look.

295
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,220
-Have a look. 
-Okay. Okay.

296
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,500
Have a look. Look.

297
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,740
So what?

298
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,640
[Gate of Heart]

299
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,860
it takes little time to download it.

300
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,820
First question.

301
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,500
What kind of movies do you like?

302
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,690
I guess that

303
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,540
the person Lingling likes

304
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,020
is a net friend.

305
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,620
That is to say.

306
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,220
Although she is

307
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,100
cool in real life,

308
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,380
it is easier for her to open her heart

309
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,730
on the Internet.

310
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:49,900
Well.

311
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,860
My office has

312
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
developed a new app

313
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,780
named Gate of Heart.

314
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,580
Try to make her

315
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,420
download it.

316
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,540
When users sign up,

317
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,060
there will be

318
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,660
a part of data input of new users.

319
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,290
You can tell me

320
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,380
her answer to every question.

321
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,060
I will input the same answer in my account.

322
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,460
The system will

323
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,420
match us.

324
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,010
Don't you fear to

325
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,460
attract more rivals?

326
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,220
It's not possible.

327
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,940
The goal that our office develops this app

328
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,260
is to

329
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,900
link the most matched ones together.

330
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,500
So, the whole process

331
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,420
is one-to-one.

332
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,410
The system would only link

333
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,340
the most matched ones

334
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,180
with you.

335
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,180
It means

336
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,500
I have three months

337
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,540
to chase her.

338
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
[Choose the contents you like]

339
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,020
Pass. Pass.

340
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,580
What are you doing?

341
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,900
You need to get

342
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,420
matched with the help of big data.

343
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,620
You just skipped all this.

344
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,700
How could you get a match?

345
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,980
What? You can get matched with no input?

346
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,940
What sound?

347
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,740
Who is it?

348
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,890

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,360
as it is so late?

523
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,680
Guess who my

524
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,190
match is?

525
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,960
How can I know that?

526
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,010
Who can be as boring as you?

527
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,290
It's him.

528
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,030
It's him?

529
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,790
No way. What a coincidence.

530
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,520
Then you two have a doomed fight.

531
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,200
I mean, romance.

532
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,840
You have no way to escape.

533
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,890
Have you talked?

534
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,910
Yes.

535
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,240
What did you talk?

536
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,050
Nothing special.

537
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,080
I told him that my graduation is postponed .

538
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,670
And he encouraged me

539
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,940
to pursue a master's degree.

540
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,010
What?

541
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,590
You haven't talked for so long.

542
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,110
And he asked you to study as soon as you got in touch.

543
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,190
So, what do you think?

544
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,250
To be honest,

545
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,350
I was thinking about

546
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,570
pursuing a master's degree in the previous years.

547
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,750
But now I only want

548
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,060
to find a job and make money.

549
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,570
Anyway, I am not that footloose.

550
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,960
I have to support my grandma.

551
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,140
I don't mean

552
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,860
the master's degree.

553
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,530
I'm talking about you two.

554
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,800
What's your feeling?

555
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,030
Do you still like him?

556
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,430
Do I like him?

557
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,240
Maybe.

558
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,470
Actually,

559
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,730
I thought that

560
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,110
I had blacklisted him

561
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
and we haven't contacted for so long,

562
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,100
you know, six years in total,

563
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,620
then, time will wash everything away.

564
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,260
And it did work

565
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,400
in these years.

566
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,700
But,

567
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,090
you know, earlier today,

568
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,100
when he

569
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,280
got in touch with me,

570
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,770
I seemed to have skipped a beat.

571
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,490
It's like

572
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,970
I sparked again.

573
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:19,940
So,

574
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,670
I'm quite constant in love, right?

575
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,820
Then,

576
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,250
why are you wearing a sad face?

577
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,100
The god is offering you another chance.

578
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,150
Come on.

579
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,910
How many decades are there in one's life?

580
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:32,920
What if

581
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,890
it prolonged for another ten years,

582
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,570
or twenty years?

583
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,780
What do you want at that time?

584
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,830
You want to have a romance with him

585
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,430
in the crematory?

586
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,130
I'm talking the truth.

587
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,070
I want to chase him, too.

588
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,240
I summoned up my courage

589
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,830
and asked him

590
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,510
what about adding friends on WeChat.

591
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,770
But he refused.

592
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,280
He refused?

593
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,710
A change of heart?

594
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,970
He has never said

595
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,780
he likes me.

596
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,750
How could that be a change of heart?

597
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,430
I think

598
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,570
he likes you.

599
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,020
Yes.

600
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,910
He must be in a fit of pique.

601
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,420
You have blacklisted him for so long.

602
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,550
It's reasonable for him to feel bad,

603
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:10,970
right?

604
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,640
Is it that?

605
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,650
A man needs respect and dignity

606
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,420
even in love.

607
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,930
He must be in a fit of pique.

608
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,610
Then what should I do?

609
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,460
I have to think for a while.

610
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,560
It's quite a hassle.

611
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,120
Wait a minute.

612
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,340
No.

613
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,010
What's wrong?

614
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,690
It's my mom.

615
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,870
My mom said that at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon...

616
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,100
a blind date again.

617
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,540
And because I missed

618
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,250
last date,

619
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,230
she's going to go with me this time.

620
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,070
You know how terrible it is.

621
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,470
No reply to my message.

622
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,060
And go straight offline.

623
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,330
What does she mean?

624
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,850
Not bad-looking.

625
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,110
Where did you get it?

626
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,610
When I studied abroad,

627
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,830
I missed her so much.

628
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,630
But I was blacklisted,

629
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,980
so I could only ask Yinfan

630
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,820
to get a photo of her

631
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,710
from our school.

632
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,730
I say,

633
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,990
you'd better go make sure

634
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,170
whether she is single or not

635
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,470
than keep guessing

636
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,190
the reason of her going offline.

637
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,750
How can I figure that out?

638
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,890
I've written that in my notebook.

639
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,200
You didn't read it, did you?

640
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,930
So, you didn't hear

641
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,770
what I said just now.

642
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,540
I heard you.

643
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,220
You ran away from home

644
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,600
because of the blind date.

645
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,510
Yes. You know what?

646
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,650
The moment I stepped into the house,

647
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,940
my mom gave me an address

648
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,770
and told me to have a blind date.

649
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,150
I flatly refused it.

650
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,730
And she scolded me so much.

651
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,290
If I hadn't played an act of

652
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,980
slamming the door

653
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,070
and running away from home,

654
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,080
I would always feel

655
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,960
inferior at home.

656
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,980
But you love dating, don't you?

657
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,070
What I love is

658
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,710
pursuing for love freely

659
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
instead of arranged marriage.

660
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,360
Of course,

661
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,700
if my mom had behaved

662
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,790
a little bit more gently,

663
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,180
I might accept it and go dating.

664
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,440
But the thing is

665
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,870
that date was arranged for my brother.

666
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,750
Why was I an alternate

667
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,840
since my brother refused to go?

668
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,980
Yes, it sounds that

669
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,000
your mom shows partiality.

670
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,590
You agree, right?

671
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,060
Why could my brother refuse the date

672
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,110
while I couldn't?

673
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,330
Mentally, I would like to support you.

674
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,190
But physically, I...

675
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,790
I...

676
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,590
I am accustomed to

677
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,680
sleeping alone.

678
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,620
My cousin.

679
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,750
Only for one night.

680
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,430
I would not turn to you

681
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,560
if I can stay in a hotel.

682
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,580
My mom blocked my account

683
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,340
before I left home.

684
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,210
Then you must be tired.

685
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,550
Yes, I am.

686
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,410
Sleep on the sofa.

687
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,030
Good boy.

688
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,330
Luckily, you were there with me.

689
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,190
And I think it still promising.

690
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,690
You are my light instead.

691
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,100
[Gate of Heart: Dear users, sorry. Because of system update,]

692
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,620
[Gate of Heart will be temporarily closed from 3:00 on 17th to 24:00 on 19th. Please forgive us for any inconvenience.]

693
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,830
So what?

694
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,710
Have you figured it out?

695
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,060
That is whatever we are talking about,

696
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,740
add the question "what about your boyfriend"

697
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,460
at the end of the conversation.

698
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:07,630
That's right.

699
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:08,890
Come on.

700
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,910
Let's have a try.

701
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,140
How is it going?

702
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,900
Not bad.

703
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,750
What about your boyfriend?

704
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,010
Have you had a meal?

705
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,430
Not yet.

706
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,700
What about your boyfriend?

707
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,730
Will you pursue a master's degree?

708
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,910
No.

709
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,440
What about your boyfriend?

710
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,790
It works.

711
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,590
Of course.

712
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,080
You're going out?

713
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,430
Yes, for the blind date.

714
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,780
Why do you change your mind?

715
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,850
Because I suddenly found

716
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,110
that girl is quite

717
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,710
funny.

718
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,240
You can be honest with me.

719
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,170
I won't laugh at you

720
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,520
even if you have given up to money.

721
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,860
I don't.

722
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,670
It really doesn't matter.

723
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,720
I don't.

724
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,860
It's okay.

725
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,170
Go ahead.

726
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,580
When will you come to help me?

727
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:43,640
[Huaihai University]

728
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,000
[Xiao]

729
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,710
[Xiao]

730
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,830
Hold a little longer.

731
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,470
I am determined to

732
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,480
meet Jiang today.

733
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,270
You should

734
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,070
hold it.

735
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,710
I will rush over as soon as I get it done.

736
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,380
Do not use your phone that often

737
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,640
when you have the meal later.

738
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,070
It's rude.

739
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,590
You could have left me home.

740
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,510
All right.

741
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,150
Then give the house back to me.

742
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,980
How can you resume it

743
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,990
since you have given it to me?

744
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,450
No.

745
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,890
Alright.

746
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,030
I know you hate to have blind dates.

747
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,750
I won't disturb you

748
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,390
if he's an ordinary boy.

749
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,860
This time is

750
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,080
different.

751
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,170
This boy is

752
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,020
especially excellent.

753
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,390
He is

754
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,570
of good personality,

755
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,000
of good race

756
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,760
and quite good-looking.

757
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,600
Then you....

758
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,610
You hurt me.

759
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,790
I'm talking to you.

760
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,460
Listen to me.

761
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,840
It hurts.

762
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,040
A lot of girls are chasing him.

763
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,180
If I hadn't had history with

764
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,020
his mom,

765
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,950
he might even not come.

766
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,930
You have history with his mom?

767
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,320
Then he's still late.

768
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,160
He doesn't respect me at all.

769
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,870
I want to

770
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,880
go to the restroom first.

771
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:18,850
I...I...

772
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,480
I'm going to refine the make-up.

773
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,030
Refine the make-up.

774
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,830
Stop. I go refine the make-up.

775
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,270
Mrs. Ouyang.

776
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,200
We've arrived.

777
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,420
Don't worry.

778
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,970
Everything is ready.

779
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,239
Shuang.

780
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,800
Why are you here?

781
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,139
Let me ask you.

782
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,150
Are you really

783
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,030
going to see that woman?

784
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,210
Didn't you say that

785
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,429
you would never

786
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,150
accept the arranged marriage

787
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,239
no matter what happens?

788
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,750
Shuang,

789
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,090
we've already finished.

790
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,730
Now whoever I meet

791
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,949
has nothing to do with you,

792
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,290
okay?

793
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,630
That's what you think.

794
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,139
I've never thought of

795
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:32,860
parting with you.

796
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,370
Guan Xiaoyu.

797
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,110
Stay there. Don't move.

798
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:41,969
Darling,

799
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:42,770
let's go.

800
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,070
Who are you?

801
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,909
Who are you?

802
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,460
Didn't he say that

803
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,340
he has nothing to do with you?

804
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,400
I'll go if you don't.

805
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:50,870
Who is she?

806
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,639
Say it.

807
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,190
My wooer.

808
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,390
Do or not? Get in the car.

809
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,440
I'll come.

810
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,660
Be quick.

811
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,350
Don't go.

812
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,570
Get off.

813
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,710
Aunty,

814
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,550
I have a word for you.

815
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,310
Do not stop the car

816
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:09,940
by yourself anymore.

817
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,700
It's dangerous.

818
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,960
Men don't deserve your death for love.

819
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,300
You are aunty.

820
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,410
Guan Xiaoyu.

821
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,160
Come back.

822
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,510
-Stop there. Guan Xiaoyu. 
-Come back.

823
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,520
Guan Xiaoyu,

824
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,330
What do you mean?

825
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,180
Why should we stop the server?

826
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,310
Why am I unaware that

827
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,320
the system needs to upgrade?

828
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,550
Calm down. Calm down.

829
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,090
Have a seat.

830
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,020
I'll explain it to you.

831
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,760
It's like this.

832
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,860
The login interface

833
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,910
needs to be improved.

834
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,340
What's more,

835
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,350
the input mode of users' information

836
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,450
is somehow stiff.

837
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,170
I've told the programmers

838
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,960
to improve it.

839
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,360
And

840
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,170
I am thinking that

841
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,070
if the three-month investigation

842
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,420
is too longer.

843
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,100
Do we really

844
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,900
have the right or qualification

845
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,000
to decide for users?

846
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,020
I've searched it on Weibo

847
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,660
and discovered that

848
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,830
many users refused to download it

849
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,220
just because of that.

850
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,860
At the beginning of this program,

851
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,170
I've already said that the time span

852
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,550
should be set by users.

853
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,780
And it was you who took a firm stand against it.

854
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,560
I was wrong.

855
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,090
Alright.

856
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,220
Then go improve it.

857
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,030
Ask the engineering department to work overtime.

858
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,870
My treat of midnight snacks.

859
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,390
It hurts. It hurts...hurts.

860
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,280
It hurts.

861
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,670
Wang Tao.

862
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,270
Zheng Minghao.

863
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,530
What the hell do you want?

864
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,090
It's you who was about to give me a beat.

865
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,470
And you asked me what I want.

866
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,610
Are you kidding?

867
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,040
This morning...

868
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,050
this morning human resource department

869
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,560
phoned me

00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,570
Don't get me wrong.

1044
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,000
My buddy wants me

1045
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:37,470
to send her the love letter

1046
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,730
for him.

1047
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,700
Ask him to give up.

1048
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:41,630
Bai Lingling

1049
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,010
has already had a boyfriend.

1050
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,370
Really?

1051
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:48,890
Believe it or not.

1052
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:51,870
Then, what about you?

1053
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,470
Do you have a boyfriend?
