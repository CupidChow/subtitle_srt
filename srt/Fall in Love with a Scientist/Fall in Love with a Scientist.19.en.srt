than you're

standing by my side now.

Look. Firework show.

21
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,460
It's so close.

22
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,420
Did you bring me

23
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,300
here intentionally

24
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,460
to let me watch the firework show?

25
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,700
Do you want to flatter me?

26
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,540
You're thinking too much.

27
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,620
I just want to please myself

28
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,060
on this occasion.

29
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,060
Do you think I'm a barrel of laughs?

30
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,260
Barrel of laughs, look at that.

31
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,380
During this period,

32
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,420
everyday you go to the lab,

33
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,620
visit your grandma,

34
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,620
and take care of me.

35
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,260
It must be tiring.

36
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,100
What can I do about it?

37
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,260
It could have been easy for me,

38
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,490
but you forced me.

39
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,940
Forget it. This will be over soon.

40
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,380
Consider it my way of saying thank you.

41
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,540
Take this.

42
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,380
What does this mean?

43
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,970
Do you think

44
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,500
I did a good job with my cleaning

45
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,540
and I'm eligible

46
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,460
for a job of being your nanny?

47
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,900
Don't get me wrong.

48
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,460
This is my wage card.

49
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,100
My wages from the lab,

50
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,060
my scholarship for studying abroad,

51
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,260
and my bonuses for scientific research

52
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,540
are all in it.

53
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,700
I just want you to keep it for me.

54
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,340
I heard from Professor Jiang

55
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,650
that this is a tradition of Huaihai University.

56
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,970
What tradition?

57
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,590
Nothing.

58
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,730
Just keep it.

59
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,110
Please.

60
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,950
Keep it.

61
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,440
He gave his wage card to you?

62
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,540
He also told me it's a

63
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,690
tradition of Huaihai University.

64
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,490
I spent four years in Huaihai University

65
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,330
and I don't know anything about this tradition.

66
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,430
It's nonsense.

67
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,050
Did you accept it?

68
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,640
Of course not.

69
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,510
What's wrong with you?

70
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,360
You told me it's OK

71
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,800
playing with your feelings,

72
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,270
but never your money.

73
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:06,720
Now

74
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,050
he wants to give you money.

75
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,910
Why didn't you accept it?

76
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,540
This kind of man is brilliant!

77
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,140
Don't be picky.

78
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,950
I was

79
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,260
blinded by love.

80
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,420
I wasn't sober-minded.

81
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,180
Then are you sober now?

82
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,110
Of course.

83
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,650
But I'm wondering

84
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,030
if Yang Lanhang

85
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,000
read my

86
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,890
official account.

87
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,240
What?

88
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,890
I released an article

89
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,230
about how to please your girlfriend

90
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,870
if she is angry.

91
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,250
The first step is

92
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,640
to buy a gift.

93
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,860
If you don't know what to buy,

94
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,950
give her money.

95
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,630
After all, we are no longer at the age

96
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,020
of just listening to sugared words.

97
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,360
Something practical is necessary.

98
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,870
The second step

99
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,470
is pretending to be miserable and

100
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,820
making you feel like you can't live without him

101
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,120
and you are not comfortable without him.

102
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,960
See,

103
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,310
he did it all.

104
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,480
You are right.

105
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,990
These are all his tricks.

106
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,420
So he definitely

107
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,600
read my official account.

108
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,080
But

109
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,130
which stage

110
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,650
are you two at now?

111
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,000
What are you talking about?

112
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,550
I will be free

113
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,520
when he leaves the hospital in several days.

114
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,280
That's it?

115
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,030
I don't understand.

116
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,260
Your parents wanted to pick you up,

117
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,220
but you refused.

118
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,200
And you have two younger cousins,

119
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,710
strong and tall.

120
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,220
Why do you have to torture me?

121
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,230
Let me do it.

122
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,110
Don't touch it.

123
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,669
I just think

124
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,600
you are a very good driver.

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,490
Bullshit.

126
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,840
That's nonsense.

127
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,200
Well,

128
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,590
this is as far as I can take you.

129
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,820
Are you OK with going home alone?

130
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,830
That's very kind of you.

131
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,880
Thank you.

132
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,260
Not at all.

133
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,360
Get some rest when you get home.

134
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,370
OK.

135
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,550
Oh,

136
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,720
I will go to the university tomorrow.

137
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,770
I have a lecture.

138
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,910
Can you take me to the university?

139
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,810
You wish.

140
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,720
Morning,

141
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,190
Bai.

142
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,660
Do you know

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
that guru left the hospital today

144
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,440
and went home to rest?

145
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,230
When should we

146
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,380
visit him together?

147
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,900
You guys go.

148
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,160
I'll pass.

149
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,300
Fine.

150
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,810
By the way, in the first place,

151
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,490
we kept a low key

152
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,370
about our project.

153
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,010
After it became a hot topic

154
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,280
and guru received the operation,

155
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,660
it went viral

156
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,880
in the university.

157
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,020
Guru even had a

158
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,780
fan club overnight.

159
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,860
He is no longer

160
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,120
the guru of my own.

161
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,170
That sounds good.

162
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,520
You should

163
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,150
be happy for him and congratulate him.

164
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,710
It's boring

165
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,380
to be the guru of your own.

166
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,690
Those mortals are

167
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,560
no match to me.

168
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,080
By the way,

169
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,850
will you attend the guru's lecture tomorrow?

170
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,900
No.

171
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,740
It's alright if you don't.

172
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,880
I saw the forum,

173
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
and found that those who said they were going to

174
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,270
occupy a seat were all female juniors.

175
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,280
If you go,

176
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,960
you will only feel your youth has gone

177
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,220
and you have grown old.

178
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,120

00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,410
OK.

354
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,780
If you are my boyfriend,

355
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,570
you won't let me stay up

356
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,990
to translate a document, right?

357
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,950
No.

358
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,260
I'll translate it for you

359
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,020
and make marks.

360
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,110
Deal.

361
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,160
No problem.

362
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,360
Girlfriend.

363
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,160
Boyfriend.

364
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,280
Bye. Bye.

365
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,500
Watch out.

366
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,320
Bye.

367
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,890
Why are you so stubborn?

368
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,110
Did I waste my time

369
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,900
telling you what I said

370
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,160
when we celebrated the New Year?

371
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,170
I'm telling you,

372
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,390
Lingling is firm in speech, but soft in heart.

373
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,320
She knows it better than anyone.

374
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,200
She will forgive Yang Lanhang

375
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,550
sooner or later.

376
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,040
It's just

377
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,350
a matter of time.

378
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,890
Why won't you just give up?

379
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,090
Right?

380
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,069
Hello?

381
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,940
Hello? Zheng Minghao,

382
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,240
why didn't you speak?

383
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,839
Hello?

384
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,200
What the hell?

385
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:15,869
Are all science boys

386
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,390
so serious nowadays?

387
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,829
Your coffee.

388
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,900
Waiter. One more...

389
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,800
Panpan.

390
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,090
This is really you.

391
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,930
Why are you here?

392
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,770
I signed up for

393
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,820
a repetition class nearby.

394
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,170
I plan to take the exams

395
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,930
again this year.

396
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,540
Then you should be studying harder

397
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,680
instead of being here.

398
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,900
I don't want my parents

399
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,990
to know what happened.

400
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,460
Besides,

401
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,430
I want to return your money as soon as possible.

402
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,060
I told you that

403
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,530
I'm in no hurry.

404
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,460
No.

405
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,770
Only when I return your money,

406
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,910
will I have the courage to pursue you again.

407
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,030
Kidding.

408
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,290
Oh,

409
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,010
how's it going

410
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,360
between you and Ouyang Yifan?

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,670
Nothing happened between us.

412
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,860
I thought

413
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,200
you'd be together.

414
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,880
That's not possible.

415
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,680
He is the last person

416
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,230
I want to be with.

417
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,580
Why?

418
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,170
Panpan, come down and give me a hand.

419
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,750
I need to go.

420
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,130
Go ahead.

421
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,920
Actually, I think

422
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,050
you may have prejudices

423
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,600
and misunderstandings about Ouyang.

424
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,250
Although I don't like him either,

425
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,180
and I don't want to

426
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,650
see you being with him,

427
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,470
I do hope

428
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,280
you don't miss someone

429
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,370
who may be the

430
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,800
right person for you.

431
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,150
What are you saying?

432
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,590
Nothing.

433
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm going.

434
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,830
Finish what you started.

435
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,630
Did Ouyang Yifan say anything

436
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,890
to you?

437
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,560
What's up? What's up?

438
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,990
Hang, are you OK?

439
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,500
Why did your heartbeat accelerate?

440
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,680
Should I call an ambulance?

441
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,640
Right,

442
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,950
we have a blood pressure monitor in the house.

443
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,230
I'll find it for you.

444
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,660
Don't worry.

445
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,720
Attention.

446
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,360
Please make sure the strap

447
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,160
is the same height as your heart.

448
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,050
Don't move or talk.

449
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,240
Now, start monitoring.

450
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,170
Your blood pressure

451
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,640
seems to be normal.

452
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,150
It's not.

453
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,360
I think my heart is beating so fast.

454
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,800
I feel like it's exploding.

455
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,250
We might as well call an ambulance.

Really.

490
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,820
Just go.

491
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,090
Really?

492
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,200
Really.

493
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,490
No need to call an ambulance?

494
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,590
No need.

495
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,800
Just hang in there, Hang.

496
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,900
I'll be back in ten minutes.

497
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,320
Ten minutes. Wait for me.

498
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,380
Ten minutes.

499
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,770
For God's sake. What happened again?

500
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,710
Can't we talk about it on the phone?

501
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,300
Why do you bother to see me?

502
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,390
I'm busy.

503
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,070
Because you are a big liar.

504
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,010
I have to watch you.

505
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,440
Did you go to find

506
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,540
Geng Panpan again?

507
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,890
I think that boy has been kicked out of the university.

508
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,480
Why hasn't he gone away?

509
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,360
I didn't go to find him.

510
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,410
OK.

511
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll ask you another question.

512
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,710
Wasn't your company going to sue me?

513
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,850
When are you planning to sue?

514
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,570
What's your conspiracy?

515
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,080
Sue?

516
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,320
Yeah.

517
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,710
It's true that we planned to sue you.

518
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,940
But your contrast had been lost

519
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,240
by our company's legal staff.

520
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,370
It's nice that you're here today.

521
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,930
Let's re-sign the contract.

522
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,610
Are you kidding? You've made me a fool!

523
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,370
How could I re-sign it?

524
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,200
Just have a look at it.

525
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,560
No.

526
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,820
Wait.

527
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,370
I thought I put it in my car.

528
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,420
Wait a minute.

529
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,890
It might be in the trunk.

530
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,350
It occurred to me that

531
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,610
I might put it in the office.

532
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's take a rain check.

533
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,050
Are you hiding

534
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,930
something unpresentable

535
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,820
in your trunk?

536
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,170
How could it be?

537
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,420
The sunshine is so harsh today.

538
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,130
It is.

539
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,470
Since you didn't bring it,

540
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,690
I'll go home first.

541
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,490
Pay attention to sun protection!

542
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,510
You should have told me earlier!

543
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,150
I would give you a discount

544
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,960
if I knew you're the buyer.

545
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,470
No. No.

546
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,410
I should pay the market price.

547
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,700
Why didn't you tell me that

548
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,980
you have done such an impressive thing?

549
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,790
I wasn't gonna tell you.

550
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,720
The worst condition of doing business

551
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,730
is discriminatory pricing.

Ouyang Yifan said he wouldn't sue me anymore

573
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,180
and gave me a new contract.

574
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,860
It's joyful to make money!

575
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,950
So you went to see Ouyang Yifan.

576
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,370
I was on the balcony and saw

577
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,010
a girl downstairs

578
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,350
who looked just like you.

579
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,710
It seemed that she was with her boyfriend...

580
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,550
What are you talking about!

581
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,390
I just,

582
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,000
just touched his cheek lightly.

583
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,170
What's that expression!

584
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,680
You pulled my leg!

585
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,200
You don't know what happened!

586
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,990
You pulled my leg!

587
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,920
Did you?!

588
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,340
Stop!

589
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,610
My nails are still wet.

590
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm thinking that

591
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,080
if one day you

592
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,340

599
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,550
I don't want to eat New Year's Eve dinner

Ouyang Yifan either!

603
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,870
I see. You don't want to eat with us.

604
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,130
You two will eat alone.

No. This thing is strange.

00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,920
as soon as we arrive at the lab

698
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,350
that you are my girlfriend.

699
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,440
No. No.

700
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,800
Do you think it's a very shady thing

701
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,420
to be my girlfriend?

702
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
How could it be?

703
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,390
I feel joyful to

704
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,030
get along with you.

705
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,620
Really.

706
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,920
And think about it.

707
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,100
I'm Yang Lanhang's girlfriend!

708
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,730
I will be gilded

709
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,820
to get together with you.

710
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,420
If we break up one day,

711
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,720
I can also write on my resume that

712
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,570
I'm the ex-girlfriend of Yang Lanhang.

713
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,120
Jesus! That's honorable.

714
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,050
I'll be valuable

715
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,220
in the dating market.

716
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,990
We just got together,

717
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,500
but you have already thought about breaking up!

718
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,640
No, no.

719
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,520
I, I,

720
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,320
I,

721
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,410
I just feel stressed out

722
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,340
that I'm falling in love with you.

723
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,260
My mouth...

724
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,940
My mouth can't speak well.

725
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,820
So you don't want

726
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,620
someone else to know

727
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,630
that we are dating?

728
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,680
It's not that

729
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,810
I don't want people to know it.

730
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,280
Although love is really

731
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,420
a matter of two people.

732
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,470
There is no need to publicize it.

733
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,520
But

734
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,650
I also don't want to be

735
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,910
with you covertly like this.

736
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,880
Look.

737
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,430
If they find it by themselves,

738
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,480
then just let it go.

739
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,910
But if they don't,

740
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,210
it seems silly for us to

741
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,390
announce it to them.

742
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,440
This made me feel like

743
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,570
I'm making a fuss.

744
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,290
This isn't my first relationship.

745
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,430
Isn't this your first relationship?

746
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,580
How many times do you have?

747
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,260
How many...

748
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,850
Let me count.

749
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,800
How many do you have?

750
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,020
No. Just kidding.

751
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,690
Only once.

752
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,280
First time. First time.

753
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,120
Really? You aren't lying?

754
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:49,960
Really.

755
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,430
I'll get nervous too.

756
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,200
Bai.

757
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,840
I saw you coming here

758
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,680
together with guru

759
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,110
this morning, right?

760
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,850
So...

761
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,000
you already know it?

762
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,150
Why didn't you persuade him?

763
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,070
You'll be responsible

764
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,120
if anything goes wrong.

765
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,870
Nothing bad will happen.

766
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,670
That's his private affairs.

767
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,020
Private affairs?

768
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,240
Although it was you who

769
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,880
put forward "the degradation of polymer scaffolds in the body",

770
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,540
But the final achievement

771
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,340
is out of the joint effort

772
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,200
of our entire lab.

773
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,170
It's the affair of all of us!

774
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,560
Guru had just been discharged from hospital,

775
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,240
and hasn't even passed his observation period yet.

776
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,920
He should have a rest at home.

777
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,600
Why did he come back so early?

778
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,240
He can count on the rest of us

779
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,240
in the lab.

780
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,690
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

781
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,700
Yes. You're right.

782
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,750
I also think that

783
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,680
he should have a rest.

784
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,390
You bet.

785
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,310
I remember that guru had mentioned that

786
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,580
he had a girlfriend or somewhat...

787
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,640
I don't know

788
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,600
about his past,

789
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,610
but I know who

790
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,210
his current girlfriend is.

791
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,990
Have you ever seen her?

792
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,680
Who?

793
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,130
Me.

794
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,590
Bai Lingling.

795
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,580
You are boasting.

796
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,820
Why don't you cook

797
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,040
by yourself recently?

798
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,730
I have no spare time.

799
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,140
Well, I won't eat with you.

800
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,760
You are here.

801
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,550
So many dishes?

802
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,400
You're still in the observation period.

803
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,590
You don't need to cook by yourself.

804
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,429
That's OK. My mother cooked them for me.

805
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:15,400
Start eating.

806
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,510
OK.

807
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,980
Jing.

808
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,699
Why are you eating here?

809
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,860
Come on. Go there.

810
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:23,449
let's eat together.

811
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,489
Quickly.

812
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,230
Return to our team.

813
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,560
Why is there always someone

814
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,150
who likes playing gooseberry?

815
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,290
Don't we always

816
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,800
eat together?

817
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,239
Yeah, but...

818
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,710
Now the conditions have changed.

819
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,320
What's the difference?

820
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,340
Give me one.

821
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,040
Don't you believe us?

822
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,030
Then...

823
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,430
I'll say it.

824
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,860
Go on.

825
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,160
Well...

826
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
We'll announce to

827
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,440
all of you

828
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,000
officially that

829
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,530
we are together.

830
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,270
From now on,

831
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,870
we hope that

832
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,340
you can leave some

833
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,310
private space for us.

834
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,710
Laugh?

835
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,860
Just eating. Eating.

836
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,270
It doesn't matter.

837
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,150
Let's eat.

838
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,030
No.

839
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,110
Go on, please.

840
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,490
We'll...change to another place.

841
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,200
You.

842
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,160
Are you okay?

843
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,420
I'm fine.

844
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,950
Let me know if you

845
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,970
need any help.

846
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,500
Are you worried about my body?

847
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,470
I'm okay.

848
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:23,970
I went to see Doctor Li

849
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,810
before I came here.

850
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,990
I didn't mean that.

851
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,120
I just feel that

852
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,640
you two are a little strange recently.

853
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,330
We two?

854
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,220
I think Bai Lingling

855
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,820
is kind of strange.

856
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,420
She did

857
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,120
deserve credit for doing the experiments

858
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,570
and has performed well lately.

859
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,360
I fully understand that

860
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,600
you're too embarrassed to say no.

861
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,690
After all,

862
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,980
we've been working together

863
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,920
for such a long time

864
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,010
and have already established friendships as colleagues.

865
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,780
So we should be considerate, right?

866
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,000
But

867
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,310
if she had interfered

868
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,400
with your work in any way,

869
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,570
you'd better tell me.

870
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll ask the Professor to expel her

871

00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,670
if I don't have time to go to the gym

1045
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,260
but I still want to do physical exercise,

1046
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,180
I can put a small

1047
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,480
dumbbell in it.

1048
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,710
Then I can exercise while stuck in traffic.

1049
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,350
A "Mini Watermelon" in my left hand,

1050
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,900
and a small dumbbell in my right hand...

1051
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,750
Sir, that's enough.

1052
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,100
You don't need to prove it to me.

1053
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,560
It's okay if you believe in what you say.

1054
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,070
Give me the bags.

1055
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:47,970
Thank you.
