OK, see you soon.

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,220
Are you serious, Guan Xiaoyu?

6
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,460
He has wife and kids.

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,340
Are you

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,460
that hungry?

9

What are you talking about?

He is my idol.

11
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,020
I have been pitching articles to his magazine for six months.

12

Haven't got a single response.

13
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,380
A self-introduction is all I needed.

14
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,940
That's simple.

15

If you promise me to be my girlfriend,

Are you Yifan or Yinfan?

27
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,660
I am so approchable.

28
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,130
Of course I am Yifan.

How's everything lately, brother?

30
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,290
As handsome as always.

I'm sure now.

32
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,850
A person who is so good at flattering others

33

must be Yifan.

He is my neighbor.

36

Nice to meet you, Editor Tang.

37
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,960
You are...

38
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,930
Your girlfriend?

Brother,

53
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,710
I would like to propose a toast to you.

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,920
Is there

55
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,630
any Miss Shi

56
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,770
among our guests today?

57
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,570
Mom, you said Miss Shi?

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,460
Yes.

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,090
Director Shi from Jiahua Group

60
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,850
just told me

61
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,150
he needed to leave for some emergency.

62
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,200
Before he left,

63
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,250
he told me specifically about

64
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,310
taking care of his daughter.

65
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,820
But after he left,

66
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,040
I just realized

67
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,920
I forgot to ask him

68
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,180
which one is his daughter.

69
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,280
The strangest thing is,

70
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,120
he specifically told me

71
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,510
about you.

72
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,730
Son, are you sure you don't know her?

73
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,700
Mother,

74
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,840
are you familiar

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,930
with Director Shi?

76
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,030
To some extent, yes.

77
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,540
We all started from nothing.

78
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,340
So we do know about each other.

79
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,840
So he didn't become a womanizer after

80
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,430
he became rich?

81
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,950
Of course not.

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,050
Well,

83
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,930

84
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,360
get all this gossip from?

00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,030

Of course I do.

About five minutes later,

all lights will be dimmed.

102
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,790
At that time, there will be a beam of light

falling on Bai Lingling.

104

You will go on stage and confess your love.

You should think about what you should say as soon as you can.

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,260
this melody

is written

143
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,760
by the famous musician Schumann

144
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,810
to his beloved one.

145
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,580
I used to swear that

146
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,840
I would only play it for myself,

147
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,400
and for my beloved one.

148
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,310
Guan Xiaoyu,

149
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,340
I like you.

150
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:24,910
I know

151
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,170
in the pass few days

152
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,010
I behaved badly.

153
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,620
I dared not to call this love.

154
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,050
I wasn't serious enough.

155
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,150
It's just I was

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,330
extremely weak.

157
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,740
I was afraid that I would lose if I was being serious first.

158
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,590
So I forced myself

159
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,510
to be that

160
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,730
person who cared less,

161
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,580
and who was more indifferent.

162
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,600
But I found out that I was wrong.

163
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,300
As long as I can be with you,

164
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,540
I would like to

165
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,930
be defeated by you willingly.

166
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,960
There are many reasons

167
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,840
for the sudden deterioration

168
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,680
of the disease.

169
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,940
It could be

170
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,580
a new environment that

171
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,840
makes it uncomfortable.

172
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,890
Or other changes that

173
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,700
are temporarily unobservable.

174
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,670
So can we give first aid now?

175
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,270
Not recommended.

176
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,190
In view of

177
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,620
its cardiorespiratory status,

178
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,550
once anesthesia is administered hastily,

179
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,810
there could be a

180
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,520
very high probability of death.

181
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,580
So conservative treatment is recommended.

182
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,720
If it survives tonight,

183
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,940
we will have a 50-50 chance.

184
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,900
We can

185
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,040
first implant a bioprosthetic valve.

186
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,840
After the tissue valves

187
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,060
are grown,

188
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,860
we then perform micro-invasive replacement.

189
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,750
OK.

190
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,140
Then let's take turns

191
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,020
keeping an eye on it tonight.

192
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,820
OK.

193
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,040
Since we brought it here,

194
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,800
we have to be responsible for it.

195
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,310
OK, I'll be the first one then.

196
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,070
OK.

197
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,160
Call me any time

198
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,420
if something is up.

199
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:17,880
OK.

200
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,510
Thank you.

201
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,320
Guan Xiaoyu

202
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,420
put a nail sticker on my nail.

203
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,310
She said it matched with this dress.

204
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,370
It dropped.

205
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,230
I'll help you treat the wound.

206
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,150
Wound?

207
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:52,950
Come.

208
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,320
I.

209
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,530
I am all right.

210
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,710
Let me take a look.

211
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,120
I am really all right.

212
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,260
Actually,

213
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,020
we came by a few minutes early

214
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,570
but it didn't help at all.

215
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,300
It's my fault for

216
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,680
being too anxious when I received the call.

217
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,320
How could I blame you?

218
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,410
I'll do it by myself.

219
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,210
That's OK.

220
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,020
Thanks.

221
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,360
I am also very anxious about this matter.

222
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,410
Besides,

223
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,130
it's not the first day that I met you.

224
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,260
I know about you

225
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,110
a little bit.

226
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,670
I know how important

227
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,720
the scientific research is for you.

228
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,310
An emergency like this

229
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,030
can not allow any delay.

230
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,430
Come on.

231
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,790
I'll do it by myself.

232
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,290
That's OK.

233
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,010
It's not convenient enough when you dress like this.

234
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,170
Thank you.

235
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,600
It might hurt a little bit.

236
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,570
Suck it up.

237
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,550
That's OK.

238
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,470
I just don't really know how to wear high heels.

239
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm not accustomed to these, you know?

240
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,250
Luckily we left early today.

241
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,850
Otherwise, I will

242
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,360
sprain my ankle a few more times tonight.

243
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,530
The worst case would be

244
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,580
when we are dancing

245
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,800
on the dance floor,

246
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,610
I sprain my ankle and you sprain yours.

247
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,320
Right?

248
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,510
When did you sprain your ankle?

249
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,980
It's so swollen.

250
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,620
I came after my dad in the middle of it,

251
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,230
came after my dad.

252
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,830
You didn't feel quite good

253
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,890
when chasing after him, right?

254
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,100
I mean, your dad...

255
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,320
You chose to hate him,

256
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,000
and that must be very uncomfortable.

257
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,790
What else could I do?

258
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,650
It's not like I wanted to.

259
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,119
I had to.

260
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,010
Think about it.

261
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,770
He abandoned my mother and me at that time.

262
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,000
My mother worked so hard that she got sick.

263
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,190
She was depressed inside.

264
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,040
Got sick.

265
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,800
Passed away.

266
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,319
If I don't hate him,

267
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,079
that would be ungrateful for my mother.

268
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,760
But we don't necessarily

269
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,109
understand the adult world.

270
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,410
If your mother ever knows that

271
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,420
you are so upset right now,

272
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,930
she will be grieving, too.

273
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,520
Actually I know

274
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,160
how hard it is for me to hate my dad.

275
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,130
Thank you.

276
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,030
I'm not an ungrateful child now.

277
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:37,970
After that,

278
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,140
I secretly went to

279
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,490
see my dad once.

280
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,060
I remember that was

281
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,480
in an extremely hot

282
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,210
summer day.

283
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,800
I saw my dad loading

284
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,190
and unloading the car

285
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,570
by himself.

286
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,880
He was so tired and sweaty.

287
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,980
Then,

288
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,010
that woman was by his side.

289
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,140
She was giving him some water,

290
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,440
wiping his sweat.

291
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,300
At that time, I understood

292
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,060
that woman was not

293
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,410
an idler.

294
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,170
She was going through the hardship

295
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,310
with my dad.

296
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,870
But when I came back home and saw my mom,

297
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,130
I felt bad.

298
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,560
Do you understand that kind of feeling?

299
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,530
I think,

300
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,870
my mother is not

301
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,640
that kind of idler.

302
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,530
Why do they have to be separated?

303
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,800
Thank you.

304
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,780
Don't mention it.

305
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
You know, when I was a kid,

306
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,300
I was very dependent on my dad.

307
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,940
At that time,

308
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,370
my dad told me

309
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,260
stories every night.

310
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,360
He also taught me how to write,

311
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,120
and how to recite poems.

312
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,720
and I was on his shoulders.

313
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,650
Let me be on his shoulders.

314
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,650
I couldn't figure out

315
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,720
why can't he

316
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,300
hold on a little longer?

317
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,120
Just a little longer.

318
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,350
Why?

319
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,160
Why did they have to be separated?

320
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,260
Because your dad

321
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,310
also has

322
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,400
his own life.

323
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,470
Each of us

324
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,230
has a life of our own.

325
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,540
You too.

326
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,550
So don't carry things that

327
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,810
don't belong to you.

328
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,670
Don't ever let those most generous feelings

329
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,720
be blinded

330
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,850
by those things.

331
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,580
Maybe next time

332
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,630
when you see him,

333
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,610
you can smile to him a little.

334
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,170
Smile?

335
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,350
Don't you know

336
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,440
you have a beautiful smile?

337
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,430
And I think it should also be a long time since

338
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,030
you have smiled to him.

339
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,920
I also hear that

340
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,260
every father guards

341
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,900
his daughter's smile.

342
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,830
To fight for this thing no matter what.

343
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,390
Maybe if you smile a little,

344
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,990
he will be full of tears

345
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,040
to find you to confess.

346
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,070
I don't need any confession.

347
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,850
No confession then.

348
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,600
Then,

349
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,370
whatever you want to get,

350
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,260

357
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,770

This one. I know about this book.

362

That's so great!

376

They are all stable now.

379
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,000
The next step is to

380
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,840
observe and heal gradually.

381
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,610
A night of hard work for everyone.

382
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,540
Go back to have some rest.

383
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,760
I will keep working with Professor Jiang.

384
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,600
OK.

385
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,690
-Go. 
-So nice of you.

386

387
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,850

-You first.

391

Never mind.

392
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,710
I don't have much to say.

393

I will go back to my room first.

395
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,730
Why did you disappear

396
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,570
without telling me?

397
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,790
I have planned the whole night

398
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,510
for you.

399
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,680
When the light was on,

400
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,940
I intended to let you confess,

401
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,580
not to let you do a magic trick.

402
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,640
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,280
I did have a reason.

404
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,430
Now it's all messed up.

405
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,170
I was not only forced on stage

406
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,890
and talked nonsense

407
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,400
and got refused.

408
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,740
Now even my parents

409
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,670
are blaming me for

410
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,640
being mischievous on the banquet

411
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,230

412
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,530
Whatever I do is wrong now.

413

What about this?

414
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,740
You and I rent a house together.

415
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,860
No.

416
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,060
You rent a house.

417
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,520
I will move to live with you.

418
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,780
I kissed her.

419
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,260
What?

420
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,740
You kissed her?

421
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,310
You did it?

422
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,790
You forced it or it happened naturally?

423
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,010
What happened afterwards?

424
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,650
Nothing happened afterwards.

425
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,740
What's her reaction?

426
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,300
No reaction.

427
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,260
She seems to be avoiding me.

428
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,400
You didn't tell her

429
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,620
that you are Forever is for Ever?

430
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,550
She didn't give me the chance.

431
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,620
She didn't give you the chance to say it.

432
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,750
Did she give you the chance to kiss her?

433
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,700
You kissed her anyway.

434
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,590
This is your problem.

435
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,350

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,530
for you with my heart

437
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,320
and helped you design

438
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,840
a perfect confession plan.

439
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,010
You not only didn't follow it,

440
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,980

445

447
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,310
confess and tell her your identity,

448
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,570
and kiss her witnessed by

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,030
It's not what I intended to say.

527
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,760
I still think it

528
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,230
not appropriate after consideration.

529
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,450
So I asked the opinion of the hospital.

530
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,620
The opinion give by the leaders

531
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,880
are similar to mine.

532
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,640
Although your grandma's heart

533
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,450
is left with psychological shadow

534
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,260
due to the mechanical valve implantation,

535
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,010
the

536
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,690
mechanical valve itself

537
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,690
has no other problems now.

538
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,040
We have examined

539
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,170
your grandma.

540
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,020
Her body index

541
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,990
is all good.

542
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,160
But,

543
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,760
as a doctor,

544
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,110
I shouldn't suggest patients

545
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,500
doing clinical trials.

546
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,230
Let alone suggesting them changing the valve.

547
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,220
You know the situation as well.

548
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,900
We promised her out of no choice

549
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,490
to calm her down.

550
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,260
It was in an urgent situation,

551
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,600
so I didn't think it through.

552
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,650
Sorry.

553
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,540
But it is

554
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,380
the only hope that is

555
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,270
supporting my grandma to live.

556
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,700
You know the operation is

557
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,500
very important to her.

558
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,600
And her depression

559
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,900
has just been relieved a bit.

560
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,290
How could I tell her

561
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,600
that the operation cannot be done anymore?

562
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,240
Don't worry.

563
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,920
The hospital just don't suggest

564
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,840
clinical trials.

565
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,850
But

566
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,110
after the experiment is successful,

567
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,000
when the material is officially on the market,

568
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,390
if you still want to do the operation,

569
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,270
just do it.

570
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,490
No one can stop you then,

571
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,380
It means that

572
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,850
you just need to wait for a while.

573
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,310
Right?

574
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,820
You can be more

575
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,080
assured this way.

576
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
OK. Thank you, Doctor Li.

577
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:24,780
Right,

578
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,810
I would like to

579
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,530
ask you some questions

580
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,210
about the sudden symptoms of Zoey.

581
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,760
Name it.

582
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,530
It's that...

583
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,830
Zoey was attacked suddenly this time.

584
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,840
And I realized that

585
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,850
if human patients

586
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,900
are caught in the same situation.

587
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,580
They have to

588
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,560
change the valve in time.

589
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,320
There won't be enough time

590
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,750
to wait until the tissue engineering valve

591
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,840
to grow to a full forming.

592
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,440
Especially for people like my grandma

593
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,360
who have implanted

594
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,500
mechanical valves before.

595
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,380
Her operation needs to open her chest.

596
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,760
Minimal invasive operation cannot be applied for her.

597
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,440
Doctor Li,

598
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:54,900
I have a plan

599
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,910
and want to discuss it with you.

600
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,390
You two talk first.

601
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,330
I...I will talk to you next time.

602
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,220
Did you have a fight?

603
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,750
It's all my fault.

604
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,050
I have been wanting to confess every day.

605
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,930
But so much time

606
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,900
has passed.

607
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,280
Confess what?

608
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,760
I will explain it to you later.

609
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,640
Wait for me.

610
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,690
Lingling.

611
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,540
It seems like you didn't succeed in confessing.

612
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,620
Come. We need to talk about some serious stuff.

613
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:01,970
The attack of Zoey

614
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,480
that night made me realize

615
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,320
that our valve

616
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,540
has a big problem

617
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,670
that needs to be revised.

618
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,610
I have

619
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,450
discussed the plan with Ouyang,

620
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,580
and would like to discuss it with you.

621
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,060
Does Bai Lingling know this?

622
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,860
No.

623
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,790
The plan is new

624
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,920
and in confidential stage.

625
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,430
Only Ouyang and I know about it,

626
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,320
and professor.

627
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,320
What?

628
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,800
You two have a tacit understanding.

629
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,230
She was here

630
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,780
saying exactly what you said just now.

631
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,000
But she didn't finish

632
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,090
because you were here.

633
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,810
Actually she was the

634
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,510
first one that put forward this.

635
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,530
That girl is interesting.

636
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,540
Although she has a thin basis,

637
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,520
she is really good at finding in research.

638
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,070
You can talk to Jiang

639
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,210
and cultivate her in a good way.

640
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,680
Right.

641
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,010
What's wrong with you two?

642
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,160
Did she confess with you

643
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,380
like the other girls

644
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,260
and

645
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,310
was turned down by you?

646
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,460
How can it be such a good thing.

647
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,630
Confess with me...

648
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,380
Bai,

649
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,150
you came back from the hospital so quickly.

650
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,070
I'm your senior.

651
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,200
Lingling.

652
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,420
What did your grandma say?

653
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,430
What did Doctor Li say?

654
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,280
Doctor Li said

655
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,500
considering her condition

656
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,050
he didn't suggest her

657
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,100
to participate in

658
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
clinical trials.

659
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,090
Then it would be one less again.

660
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,200
One less again?

661
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,710
Actually,

662
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,870
we were quite worried.

663
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,010
You haven't

664
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,420
made your decision anyway.

665
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,550
We didn't want to give you

666
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,350
too much pressure.

667
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,900
So we didn't

668
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,670
say anything.

669
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,270
What? Say it.

670
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,490
Actually,

671
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,040
it's the volunteer thing.

672
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,510
Our clinical trial

673
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,940
is about to begin soon.

674
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,909
And to guarantee the accuracy,

675
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:12,800
we should get

676
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,100
enough samples.

677
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,590
However,

678
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,000
patients are not active to participate.

679
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,940
How many more do we need?

680
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,880
If grandma doesn't participate.

681
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,739
We need at least three more.

682
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:29,719
We have

683
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:30,600
visited the cardiovascular surgery departments

684
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,280
of hospitals in the city

685
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,010
and hoped to gain support from them.

686
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,639
But the feedback

687
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,820
is not very good.

688
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,429
Most patients

689
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,480
are doubtful

690
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,730
about this new material.

691
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,320
It is natural.

692
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,199
People need

693
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,170
a long time

694
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,010
to accept

695
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,230
a new thing.

696
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,870
But the problem lies here.

697
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,300
We cannot explain it

698
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,480
to everyone.

699
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,409
What should we do now?

700
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:10,800
Have one.

701
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,750
What's wrong?

702
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,060
I'm thinking about

703
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,270
the

704
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,840
new material research.

705
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,440
We still need some volunteers now.

706
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,670
Do you have anyone who

707
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,060
has heart problems in your family?

708
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,200
What are you talking about?

709
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,550
We don't have any

710
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,010
genetic disease for three generations.

711
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,360
People in my family are really in good health.

712
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,450
Just withdraw your words.

713
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,160
Withdraw. Withdraw.

714
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,790
I'm sorry.

715
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,010
I was just so eager

716
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,440
to find someone.

717
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,580
This is a problem that the whole lad needs to solve together.

718
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,550
Why are you so anxious

719
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,770
here?

720
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,070
It is

721
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,620
a very important

722
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,450
research program

723
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,560
for my lab.

724
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,520
But to me,

725
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,390
it's not only a research program.

726
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,740
It's also the hope of my grandma.

727
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,160
Every time

728
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,310
I visit grandma,

729
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,940
I just won't stop talking.

730
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,790
Because I

731
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,600
fear of hearing

732
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,980
the sound

733
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,620
of the mechanical valve

734
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,460
if it is

735
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,180
quiet.

736
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,280
So I hope

737
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,380
the new material

738
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,970
can go to the market as soon as possible.

739
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,320
So grandma

740
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,660
can finish her operation earlier

741
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,880
and become comfortable.

742
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,140
Maybe I can write an article

743
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,190
for you on my official account.

744
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,040
Is that okay?

745
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,190
Just saying.

746
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,040
My account

747
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,550
is mainly about love

748
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,810
and sometimes there are promotions

749
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,690
about

750
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,540
cosmetics.

751
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,300
I'm just afraid...

752
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,010
It's okay.

753
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,890
I think

754
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,780
it useful.

755
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,530
Really.

756
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,090
You don't

757
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,810
need to give any guidance.

758
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,280
You can just

759
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,000
present it

760
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,800
objectively.

761
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,560
Even if

762
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,540
we cannot get volunteers,

763
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,420
it's a good thing

764
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,890
to

765
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,270
let people know about it.

766
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,160
Alright. I'll do it for you.

767
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,590
Then

768
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,470
help me with

769
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,270
some documents

770
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,190
that are easy to understand.

771
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,740
I will have a look.

772
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,750
Or I can

773
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,800
read some

774
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,640
books for starters.

775
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,350
OK.

776
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,490
I'll do it now.

777
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,450
Come. Follow me inside.

778
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,170
Come.

779
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,280
Those books

780
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:15,740
are on the top of the shelf.

781
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
Read them for your convenience.

782
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,220
These?

783
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,260
This seems to be easy to understand.

784
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,780
Yang.

785
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,630
Does this belong to Yang Lanhang?

786
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,020
Why is there a photo of you?

787
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,680
Here. You cannot understand this.

788
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,430
Read this.

789
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,270
The Basics of Materials.

790
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,920
You are kind of strange.

791
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,090
Why do you put

792
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,230
your photo in his book?

793
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,240
Do you like him?

794
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,090
Do you have a crush on him?

795
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,060
Let's get started.

796
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,350
Start the work.

797
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,530
Do you like him?

798
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,450
You like him,

799
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,420
so you put your own photo

800
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,380
in his book.

801
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,600
Wait. Wait.

802
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,530
Come.

803
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,160
Sit here.

804
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,610
Confess everything to me, quickly.

805
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,740
Do,

806
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,170
do you like him?

807
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,190
I don't like him.

808
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,540
Don't be shy.

809
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,860
It's natural.

810
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,560
It means you have a good taste.

811
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,870
But it is cliche to

812
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,630
express your love with a photo.

813
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,770
Maybe I can teach you something new.

814
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,450
I didn't put the photo.

815
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,750
He did it?

816
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,430
That's better.

817
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,270
What's better?

818
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,360
I understand why

819
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,330
you act so weird recently

820
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,880
and broke up with your net friend

821
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,060
suddenly.

822
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,160
It turns out to be this.

823
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,170
No.

824
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,890
There must be some news. Tell me.

825
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,560
Then,

826
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,650
why did you

827
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,490
break up with him suddenly?

828
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,900
Because

829
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,090
I have made a serious mistake.

830
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,680
I betrayed him.

831
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,560
So, I'm not qualified

832
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,360
to be with him.

833
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,620
Come on.

834
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,180
You are too busy in the lab

835
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,940
to even sleep.

836
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,370
Do you even have time to make mistakes?

837
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,330
You are lying.

838
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,010
Yang Lanhang and I kissed.

839
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,800
Really?

840
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,330
So,

841
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,700
you are with

842
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,520
Yang Lanhang officially?

843
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,830
No.

844
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,810
Why not?

845
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,790
What do you

846
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
think of them now?

847
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,950
I don't have any thoughts.

848
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,460
I just want to

849
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,770
do my experiments steadily

850
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,230
and take good care of grandma.

851
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,370
I don't want to think about other things.

852
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,830
You need to have

853
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,610
some thoughts on them.

854
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,730
Actually, I have wanted to tell you for a long time,

855
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,610
but

856
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,330
I don't know

857
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,840
how to tell you.

858
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,010
It's a mess.

859
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,190
It's...

860
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,460
When I 'm with

861
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,680
Yang Lanhang,

862
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,230
I always

863
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,320
think of Forever is for Ever.

864
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,920
And when I

865
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,260
text with Forever is for Ever,

866
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,740
Yang Lanhang's face

867
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,440
is always in my mind.

868
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,790
I have an illusion

869
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,520
that they are the same one.

870
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,310
Are they the same person?

871
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,060
Do you know?

872
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,660
I don't know if it is because

873
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,500
it's my first time dating online.

874
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,330
Is it that I missed him too much?

875
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,090
So

876
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,180
I reflect

877
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,930
my love to him

878
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,190
to another guy.

879
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,750
That means I use

880
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,130
Yang Lanhang as a substitute.

881
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,070
If it is true,

882
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,610
it

883
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,590
is my problem.

884
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:11,640
It is not fair

885
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,020
to both of them.

886
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,280
So,

887
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,680
I choose to give up them both.

888
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,750
[The confession is fake, but my love to you is real.]

889
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,440
Guan.

890
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,870
I think

891
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,890
the guy is quite nice.

892
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:29,860
Think about it.

893
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,760
He can stand up and

894
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,060
confess in public.

895
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,420
That means he

896
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,930
is under everybody's supervision.

897
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,530
Not everybody

898
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,340
is as pure and honest as him.

899
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,360
It's a pity if you don't like him.

900
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,620
I just think

901
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,920
he is poor.

902
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,480
Mr. Ouyang.

903
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,120
Can you share the

904
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,970
music score of the song you played just now?

905
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,900
I would like to play it

906
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,370
for my girlfriend when her birthday comes next month.

907
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,060
It's just a random play.

908
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,950
But didn't you say

909
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,670
it's the melody Schumann

910
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,800
wrote for his love?

911
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:36,940
Anyway,

912
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,320
just like that.

913
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,250
80 percent of people

914
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,840
don't even know Schumann.

915
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,190
Why are you being serious?

916
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:47,980
Sorry to bother you.

917
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,370
Ouyang Yifan.

918
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,680
I was stupid

919
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,980
to believe that you would be upset!

920
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,040
There is no

921
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,560
truth from your mouth!

922
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,090
I only made up that one.

923
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,280
I thought it would be good

924
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,180
to have a bluffing start.
