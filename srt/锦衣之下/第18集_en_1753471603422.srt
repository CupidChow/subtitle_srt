YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ah

The Long Ballad

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ah

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ah

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Who are you

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Little girl, so rude

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Who are you

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And why is it like this

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you want to ask questions, ask one by one

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You asked so many questions

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You asked me to answer which one you are

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
First, collect the things in your hands

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have no intention of entering this place

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If I offend you, please forgive me

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is almost the same

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Look at you, you are white and quiet

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You are not like a group of people

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Say it

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who are you, how did you come in

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I came from the outside to Longdan Village

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
My two friends are missing

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I heard that they were taken in

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I came down to see

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Senior, have you seen two men

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But when I was calling at the well

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I clearly heard the echo of the fog below

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why are you laughing

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Have you heard of Suolong River

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Suolong River

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It is said that the king of jade locked the dragon

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lock the captured dragon into the well

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Locked a total of 11 wells

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As long as it is destroyed, it will release the dragon

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
In fact, this is just a legend

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The sound you hear is the legendary dragon name

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To be honest

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is just the echo of the fog

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Not them

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Senior

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then the well we are in now

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Is it Suolong River

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You say first

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How did you come to Longdan Village

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
this

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hard to say

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's not hard to say

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's okay to tell you

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Suolong River

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Senior, how long have you been here

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
One year

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How to call you

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What do you think I look like

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You look like

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If I say it, you can't be angry

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Then I have to see what you say

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think about whether I am angry

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You look like a beggar

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You let me say

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The words are not bad

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ok

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then you call me

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Gai Shu

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Gai Shu

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then your real name

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You have a lot of problems

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let you call Gai Shu, you call Gai Shu

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ok

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Since the senior is not willing to reveal his real name

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then I'll call you Gai Shu

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Who locked you here

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The pirates

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Pirates

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why do they lock you

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
why

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's because I have talent

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They have a request for me

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I didn't see it

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You look worse than me

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Those pirates like the most

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Isn't it killing and robbing

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What can you have

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let them like

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You little girl

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Look down on people

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I tell you

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Although I have no money

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But I can't help me

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They don't want talent

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Just want talent

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then I don't understand

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What do they need

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What do you need to help them

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And use such a hard lock

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Lock you up

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Plant flowers

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Dragon gallbladder flowers

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Dragon gallbladder flowers

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Those dragon gallbladder flowers on the mountain

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Are all planted by you

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What is the dragon gallbladder flowers on the mountain

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Just say you little girl

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Knowledge is shallow

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't plant ordinary dragon gallbladder flowers

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a thousand miles away

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Blue jade hairpin

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What is the blue jade hairpin

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Just blue dragon gallbladder flowers

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why do they want this dragon gallbladder flower

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Not clear

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
uncle

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I heard your accent

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You were also mixed in Beijing, right?

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Little girl has a good ear

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's not me scaring you

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Really speaking of the background

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The highest commander of the Imperial Guards in Beijing

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Lu Ting

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's my Tang Zhe

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's a coincidence

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
uncle

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I took a look

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't have tools on me

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't untie this chain

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Little girl

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I understand your feelings

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I understand your feelings

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If I could run away

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I would have left

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The place you just came to

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Is the place where those pirates

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Give me food and wine

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You hurry up

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't be caught by them

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Uncle, don't worry

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I must find a way out

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Come back to save you

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am satisfied with this intention

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can chat with me

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm already very happy

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hurry up

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm not leaving

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm leaving

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No one in the gang

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Know we are trapped

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The soldiers can't come

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In a short time

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Finally untied

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Jin Xia forced me to learn

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I didn't expect it to be useful now

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Come

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Little girl

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Go in and have a look

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
go

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
go

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
go

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
go

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I didn't expect that

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mr. Lu

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There is actually a

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Grandpa who has fallen into this

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have to find them quickly

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Wait for the grandpa who saved the adults

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I made a lot of money

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Wait for me

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are so straight

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Stare at me and blame me

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sorry

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Sorry, sorry

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Strange

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Just now the stone tablet

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not like this

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Mr. Lu

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mr. Lu

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,080
Pu

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,960
How to come back here again

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,620
him sure

197
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,300
e entertainment

198
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,940
projects

199
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,260
me did not even Mario

200
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll do it myself.

201
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,160
There are traps everywhere.

202
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,040
Who shot

203
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,280
such a huge trap?

204
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,900
Look

205
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
how I miss the definition of chaos.

206
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,260
It's outrageous that

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:59,400
How about your

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,800
Hurry, hurry.

209
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,360
The water got into the house!

210
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,000
Hurry, have some water!

211
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,520
Hurry, call for help!

212
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,240
Hurry up!

213
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,880
The water got into the house!

214
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,520
Rabe!

215
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
All a kinMart did.

216
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,380
Well I'll figure something out later.

217
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,880
I just want to…

218
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Yeah…

219
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,160
I don't want to find the timing.

220
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,720
Okay. Okay.

221
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,780
Please wait.

222
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,720
Excuse me.

223
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
Stop chasing me.

224
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,240
Come.

225
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,280
Sir, why are you here?

226
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,080
What do you think?

227
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,600
You'd better think it over

228
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
before you do anything.

229
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,200
Do you know how much trouble

230
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,480
you've caused me?

231
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,200
I'm sorry, sir.

232
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,080
I'm also worried about

233
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,320
your safety and Xie Xiao's safety.

234
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
I heard that lazy man say

235
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,000
that the chief is going to take us to the police.

236
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't find you.

237
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,800
I was in a hurry...

238
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,120
So you were in a hurry

239
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,720
and broke into the ancestral hall and jumped into the police.

240
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,240
I'm not that stupid.

241
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,040
Jumping into the police.

242
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I wanted to follow

243
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,600
that iron chain down.

244
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
But I didn't expect that I would be...

245
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,640
fell down.

246
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,400
No.

247
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,360
How did you know I was here?

248
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,520
This...

249
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,800
My crystal ball.

250
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,840
I know.

251
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
I must have fell down when I was crossing the well.

252
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,400
You found this

253
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,280
by the well

254
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,480
and came down to save me.

255
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,760
So you want me to die?

256
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,200
You saved my life today.

257
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,040
I will never forget it.

258
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,480
I will make up for it in the next life.

259
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,280
I will be a fool.

260
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,160
Don't wait for the next life.

261
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,800
Just pay it off in this life.

262
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,800
Sir.

263
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,720
In my heart,

264
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,400
you are always a very high-ranking person.

265
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,000
I thought you would say

266
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
that it's just a small matter and it's not worth it.

267
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,600
It's just a small favor.

268
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,400
Your life.

269
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,920
You think it's a small matter?

270
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,720
Of course not.

271
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,440
No, no.

272
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,960
No.

273
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,120
You said that the grace of the low water

274
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,720
is a treasure of eternal power.

275
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,000
So you are not lucky.

276
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,920
You must

277
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,240
pay it off.

278
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,920
I will.

279
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,720
I will.

280
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,240
I will.

281
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,200
Sir.

282
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,360
I came out of the well.

283
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,160
These stone tablets are not arranged like this.

284
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,720
I found a mechanism.

285
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,560
Then I followed that passage

286
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,720
and found a ball room.

287
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,280
By the way, I also met a master.

288
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,960
When I came back,

289
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,080
these stone tablets were arranged like this.

290
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,600
I couldn't get out of it.

291
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,560
It's like a maze.

292
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,360
A master?

293
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,720
Yes.

294
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
He was locked up here by pirates.

295
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,360
Sir.

296
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,040
Do you want to know who he is?

297
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,440
Just say it.

298
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
If you don't want to say it, then forget it.

299
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
Don't sell the coffin here with me.

300
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,640
You definitely can't imagine it.

301
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
He is your grandfather.

302
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
Didn't you expect that?

303
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,920
Are you excited

304
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,160
that you can't even speak?

305
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,240
Your grandfather.

306
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,800
My grandfather has passed away for more than 20 years.

307
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,600
If you really see him,

308
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm really excited that I can't speak.

309
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Not your grandfather, but your grandfather Tang.

310
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,920
It was the old man who told me personally.

311
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,920
Don't worry.

312
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,080
I've asked him for you.

313
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,520
He said that

314
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
your grandfather and he

315
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,760
are brothers of several levels.

316
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,400
How to say it?

317
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,800
His grandfather and your grandfather's grandfather

318
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,640
are brothers of several levels.

319
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,640
You are his great-grandson.

320
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,600
You should call him grandfather Tang.

321
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,280
Grandfather Tang.

322
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
Yes. Yes. Yes.

323
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,680
Thank you for telling me this news.

324
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,520
I thank you on behalf of my family.

325
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
You're welcome. You're welcome.

326
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,680
This is what I should do.

327
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,440
Your grandfather looks like a beggar,

328
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,680
but he's a very good person.

329
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,920
My grandfather.

330
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
You agreed?

331
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,320
What?

332
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,320
Why is it my grandfather?

333
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
It's your grandfather.

334
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,960
Grandfather.

335
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
No. My lord.

336
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,760
Be careful.

337
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,320
What's wrong?

338
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,120
Nothing.

339
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,720
What's wrong?

340
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,200
It hurts.

341
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,960
It hurts.

342
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,320
But

343
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,320
it's Xia Okong.

344
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,720
Yang Yue.

345
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,280
Can you

346
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,280
keep your eyes off for me?

347
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,880
Okay.

348
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Are you feeling unwell?

349
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,560
I just don't like the dark.

350
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,440
I have to light up the lamp every night.

351
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Wait for me.

352
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,120
Look, there's light now.

353
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,560
There's light now.

354
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,600
You're not afraid, right?

355
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Let's go.

356
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,280
You're afraid of the dark.

357
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Take this.

358
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Come on.

359
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Sir.

360
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm afraid of the dark.

361
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm afraid of the dark.

362
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I'm afraid of the dark.

363
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
I'm afraid of the dark.

364
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm afraid of the dark.

365
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Uncle.

366
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Uncle.

367
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
We meet again.

368
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Girl.

369
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
You're so reliable.

370
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Of course.

371
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I, Yuan Jin Xia,

372
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
never say no.

373
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Sir.

374
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
This is the senior I told you about.

375
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Uncle.

376
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Do you know who this is?

377
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I don't know him.

378
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
He's the son of the commander of the imperial guard,

379
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Lu Ting,

380
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Lu Yi.

381
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
So you're my grandson.

382
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
You can't take this as a relative.

383
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
I don't want to be like a sugar grandpa

384
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
who can't be beaten by a stick.

385
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Your father is Lu Ting?

386
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
What?

387
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
You're his son?

388
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
His biological son?

389
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
You're lying.

390
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Our sir

391
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
is also a big name

392
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
in the name of the officer in the capital.

393
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
The boy is so big.

394
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Do you have any evidence?

395
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
What evidence can you prove

396
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
that I'm your grandson?

397
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Evidence?

398
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Would I lie to you?

399
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Or your young master Lu

400
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
doesn't look up to me?

401
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Uncle.

402
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Don't be angry.

403
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Sir would never mean that.

404
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Sir, say something.

405
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I have a relative.

406
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Shouldn't I prove it?

407
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
You should.

408
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
When I saw you when you were a kid,

409
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
you were called Lu Yi.

410
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
You're wronged.

411
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Wronged?

412
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
And you have a mole

413
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
on your arm.

414
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Right?

415
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
You're a good guy.

416
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
You're just like a horse.

417
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
It's similar to

418
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
your cruel father.

419
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
You're not angry

420
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
because your father is cruel, right?

421
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
You're right.

422
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I have nothing to be angry about.

423
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
But I won't call you grandpa.

424
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
I won't.

425
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
You call me grandpa

426
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
but you call me old.

427
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm still young.

428
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
If you call me uncle,

429
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
you should call me uncle, too.

430
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
I won't bother you.

431
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
How is it?

432
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
You look good in every way.

433
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
But your appearance...

434
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Appearance?

435
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
What's wrong?

436
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Our master is handsome.

437
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Many girls

438
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
admire him day and night.

439
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
That's your opinion.

440
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
In my opinion,

441
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
men should be

442
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
a little more handsome.

443
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
A woman should be more beautiful.

444
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
A woman should be more handsome.

445
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
That's what men are like.

446
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Men should be like me.

447
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Why did the pirates

448
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
trap you here?

449
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
The pirate's leader

450
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
knew that I was a drug dealer.

451
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
He knew all kinds of herbs.

452
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
So he caught me

453
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
to train the pirates.

454
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
The pirate's leader?

455
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Are they from the East?

456
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
No.

457
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
They sound like

458
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
they're from Jiangzhe.

459
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
You know that

460
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
the pirates in the coastal region

461
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
are full of evil spirits.

462
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Many Han people are involved.

463
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Is there anything special

464
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
about the blue jade hairpin?

465
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Well,

466
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I can tell you.

467
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Open the lock for me.

468
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I'll show you.

469
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Sir,

470
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
you're the only one who can save him.

471
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
You're awesome.

472
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Take us there.

473
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Yes.

474
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Come here.

475
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Don't move.

476
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
What's wrong?

477
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
He's poisoned.

478
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
See that?

479
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
That's called the long-term herb.

480
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Every herb has a poison.

481
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Especially its inner leaves.

482
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
It's more toxic.

483
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
It'll die in ten steps.

484
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Sir, please stay away.

485
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
You don't understand.

486
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
As the saying goes,

487
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
the more you get, the better you get.

488
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
If you use these things well,

489
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
you can cure the disease and save people.

490
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
So I use them

491
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
as fertilizer

492
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
for the blue jade hairpin.

493
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Sir,

494
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
why do you put the blue jade hairpin

495
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
in the jade jar?

496
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
These blue jade hairpin

497
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
are different from the common dragon-striped flower.

498
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
They need to grow in such a pure environment.

499
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Don't move.

500
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
What's wrong?

501
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
It'll ruin his growth.

502
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
The flowers are too expensive.

503
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
They'll rot if touched.

504
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
It's mostly poisonous.

505
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
If I guess right,

506
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
the blue jade hairpin

507
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
is related to the crazy people in the market.

508
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Sir,

509
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
you actually make poison for the pirates.

510
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I...

511
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
The dragon gallbladder

512
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
is not poisonous.

513
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
But after the fertilizer

514
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
is used as fertilizer,

515
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
the flowers will turn blue.

516
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
And the blue thing

517
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
is what the pirates want.

518
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
What's the use of these things?

519
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
It's a kind of toxic poison

520
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
that will numb people's brains

521
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
and make them lose their rationality and emotions.

522
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
They'll go crazy.

523
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
So the villagers

524
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
became like this

525
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
because of it.

526
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
How did the pirates know

527
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
the blue jade hairpin has this effect?

528
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
It's you again.

529
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
It's purely an accident.

530
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
You're the first doctor of the time, right?

531
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I just want to ask you.

532
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Can you

533
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
cure the poison of the blue jade hairpin?

534
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Ling'er,

535
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
if you can't cure it,

536
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
promise me

537
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
that you'll marry me.

538
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Did you two

539
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
break the door?

540
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
It's not easy to find you.

541
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Who exactly are you?

542
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I heard you're the expert

543
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
in treating poison in the martial world.

544
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I want to make a deal with you.

545
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
I'm just a village doctor in the countryside.

546
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
I don't do business.

547
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Really?

548
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
You're a village doctor?

549
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
You're not a village doctor.

550
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
I know you have a good reputation.

551
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,960
I'll do the business.

552
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,200
Right?

553
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,840
Go.

554
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,600
What's in the bottle?

555
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,400
I won't tell you.

556
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,600
It must be something good.

557
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,760
Take him away.

558
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,160
I'll take him away.

559
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,320
That's it.

560
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,280
I was brought here by them.

561
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
The pirates want to use these

562
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,720
to make a crazy man?

563
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,800
This thing

564
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,520
has a great effect on the spread.

565
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,280
I guess they want to

566
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,040
release these people as the spreaders.

567
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,160
Now it seems

568
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,600
they don't have the spread yet.

569
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,160
That's right.

570
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,680
Although I have no choice,

571
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,800
I have to train the blue jade hairpin for them.

572
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,880
But I changed the formula secretly.

573
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
So far,

574
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,360
the villagers affected by the blue jade hairpin

575
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,120
are different from normal people.

576
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,640
They won't be affected by any cross-reaction.

577
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,320
I got it.

578
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,200
No wonder Lan Qing Xuan saw the pirates

579
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,920
dragging the villagers at night.

580
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,040
So they were doing experiments.

581
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,000
If it really works,

582
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,400
the pirates

583
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,720
will suffer.

584
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,440
They used the dragon-shaped mirror to lure people.

585
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,040
They made poison here.

586
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,360
And they used innocent villagers to do experiments.

587
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,560
If the blue jade hairpin

588
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,240
really has such a strong infection,

589
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,360
all the people who are infected

590
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,680
will become crazy people

591
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,880
who don't know the truth.

592
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,360
If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable.

593
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,480
Uncle,

594
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,360
you are helping the evil.

595
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,480
But I understand that

596
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
not everyone is willing to sacrifice me

597
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,080
to protect me.

598
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,640
You left a hand here.

599
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,480
It's also a way to atone for your sin.

600
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,720
In case of any accident,

601
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
we have to destroy all these things

602
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,680
related to the blue jade hairpin.

603
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,760
In case they hurt people with this thing again.

604
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
This spirit token again.

605
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,840
What does this pangolin represent?

606
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,760
Want to die?

607
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,840
It's not that easy.

608
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,000
Since you don't want to lose,

609
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,200
now the blue jade hairpin is destroyed by you,

610
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,520
we can't go back for now.

611
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,360
Then why don't you

612
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,440
let me play with you?

613
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,760
If you don't want to lose,

614
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,840
we'll continue

615
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,560
until you lose.

616
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,680
The one on the waist is...

617
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,560
It's the ghost of the Zhou You.

618
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,160
Zhou You Ling?

619
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,120
What is that?

620
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,280
Zhou You Ling

621
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,480
is a legend of the Eastern Camp.

622
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,680
The chief

623
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,480
called him the one who cursed us.

624
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,560
He wanted us to be like Zhou You Ling

625
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,400
and fight against the sea.

626
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,840
Chief?

627
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,640
Are you talking about Mao Haifeng?

628
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,360
Yes, it's him.

629
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,360
Mao Haifeng also came to Yangzhou.

630
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't know.

631
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,200
I don't know.

632
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,520
I really don't know.

633
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,560
The chief's whereabouts are unknown.

634
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,680
Except for a few people he knows,

635
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,440
we really don't know his whereabouts.

636
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,200
How did those horses get up?

637
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
There's another path

638
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,120
in the deep forest.

639
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,560
It's a place where ghosts are not allowed to enter.

640
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,520
You're quite thoughtful.

641
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,720
Sir, we have to go back

642
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,200
and tell the villagers the truth.

643
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,920
Hurry.

644
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,160
Hurry.

645
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,160
Hurry.

646
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,160
Hurry.

647
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,360
Hurry.

648
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,120
You go first.

649
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,360
I'll destroy these first.

650
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,400
Dong Jisheng dared to do this this time.

651
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,560
I'm afraid he's still got a backup plan.

652
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,720
The Wuwan Gang is afraid that his Dong family's water debt will not work.

653
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,040
Since he dares to plot against me,

654
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,880
he has to be ready to bear all the consequences.

655
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,000
What's wrong?

656
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,920
Are you still worried about Xie Xiao?

657
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,480
It's okay.

658
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,080
Let's go back and keep looking.

659
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,440
We will definitely find him.

660
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,000
Let's go.

661
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,680
The Shi family has guarded the Suolong River for generations.

662
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,360
Now there are disaster-stricken soldiers.

663
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,040
Why did you stop?

664
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,560
Because well...

665
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,200
Let's go.

666
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,580
If my name is impressive, it will benefit you.

667
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,420
If you forget the past and forget the present,

668
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,120
You can go back to your old self.

669
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
I今em need to wake up Dragon Emissary

670
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,620
To present the gift.

671
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,040
Excellency

672
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,140
Look

673
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,420
I didn't lie to you, right?

674
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,420
These stones will really move by themselves.

675
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Wait for me!

676
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,800
Ready.

677
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,260
I should just go.

678
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,080
'm in the dark.

679
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,340
Hurry!

680
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,100
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,460
What's this?

682
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,260
Xie Xiao?

683
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,940
Another one?

684
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,380
Jinxia?

685
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,900
Lu's?

686
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,140
What's wrong?

687
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,780
Are you okay?

688
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,460
My head hurts.

689
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,380
My butt hurts too.

690
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,940
The sacrifice is over.

691
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,340
Close the gate.

692
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,780
Yes.

693
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,420
Luckily, the lord blocked it for you.

694
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,740
What do you mean?

695
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,860
The lord saved your life.

696
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,060
Otherwise, you would have fallen to your death.

697
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,540
What the hell is this place?

698
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Why are we here?

699
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
What are you doing?

700
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,980
I really want to open your head

701
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,380
and see what's inside.

702
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,980
You're not alert at all.

703
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
You're drinking alone.

704
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,860
You're framed by others

705
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,260
and you're a jinx.

706
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
You don't know it.

707
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,980
A jinx?

708
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Damn it.

709
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,860
The head of the tribe is not kind.

710
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,460
Luckily, I'm lucky.

711
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,580
Not you.

712
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,140
The lord Lu saved your life.

713
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,980
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,700
I'm sorry.

715
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,580
I'm sorry.

716
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,380
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:40,900
Thank you.

718
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
What's your attitude?

719
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,380
You...

720
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,860
Enough.

721
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,700
It's okay.

722
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,420
We need to think about

723
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,660
how to get out.

724
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,820
From the well.

725
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,220
Over there.

726
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,900
We can climb up the railing

727
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,500
and get out.

728
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,220
Are you stupid?

729
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,340
Didn't you see the well was sealed?

730
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,020
Who are you?

731
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,180
You can hit me with gold and summer.

732
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
You're a bastard.

733
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
Forget it.

734
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,780
You're a beggar.

735
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
What do you mean?

736
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,380
This is the master

737
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,700
I saved in the well.

738
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,420
You can call him Uncle Gai.

739
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Uncle Gai?

740
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,820
These crows can come and go.

741
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,660
It means there must be a secret passage

742
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,100
to the well.

743
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,820
Let's split up and find it.

744
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,580
Secret passage?

745
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,780
Watch me.

746
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,140
Be careful.

747
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,300
There are traps everywhere.

748
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,980
Why do you do this?

749
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,460
Longjing was sealed in three years.

750
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,220
It has hurt many people.

751
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,740
Now,

752
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,700
for this sudden accident,

753
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,740
it has hurt a lot of people.

754
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,540
I'm thinking

755
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,620
if it's Master Lan's advice

756
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,860
to take the villagers to move away from Longdan Village.

757
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:57,820
Patriarch.

758
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,300
We've searched everywhere.

759
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,900
We haven't found

760
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,940
the traces of those two disasters.

761
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,740
If it're missing any traces,

762
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,740
what if it's not here?

763
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,180
Where can they go?

764
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,460
I've read all these earlier.

765
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,180
Besides the complete Jesús

766
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,960
which has organs existed ever since we had somnambulism yesterday,

767
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,500
nothing else is special.

768
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
on the wall of the palace.

769
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
There are various patterns.

770
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,340
With a very strong expression,

771
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,620
you can see the paintings from left to right.

772
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,740
It's actually describing a story.

773
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,500
By the way,

774
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,740
I heard from Uncle Gai that

775
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,380
this scene is called the lock dragon scene.

776
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,620
Legend has it that the queen taught

777
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,140
to lock the captured dragons under the shape.

778
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,900
There are eleven locks in total.

779
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,100
If someone destroys this lock,

780
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,540
the dragon will be released.

781
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,780
Right, Uncle Gai?

782
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,340
You're right.

783
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,580
Xie Xiao.

784
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,940
What?

785
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,060
What's the closest to Yangzhou?

786
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,500
It should be the East Sea.

787
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,540
How far is it from Yangzhou?

788
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,940
It's estimated to be 400 miles.

789
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,100
What did you find, sir?

790
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,620
These murals

791
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,100
are mostly foreign.

792
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,540
And the English.

793
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,220
Foreign? English?

794
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,060
Look at the round shape

795
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,580
under our feet.

796
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,620
This...

797
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,220
This is the Taiji picture.

798
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,660
That's right.

799
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,500
The Taoist scriptures say that

800
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,820
the Tao is born as one,

801
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,860
the Yi is born as two,

802
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,940
the Er is born as three,

803
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,380
and the San is born as ten thousand.

804
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,980
The Yin and the Yu are foreign,

805
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,260
and the Yang and the Yu are foreign.

806
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,420
The Yin is born as Yang,

807
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,460
the Yang is born as Yin,

808
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,580
and the Yang and the Yang are separate.

809
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,740
This Taiji picture looks simple,

810
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,940
but it contains

811
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
the rules of the growth and change of all things in the world.

812
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,740
The Taiji is born as two,

813
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,900
the Yang and the Yi are four,

814
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,220
and the four are eight.

815
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,700
Are these murals

816
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,340
actually arranged

817
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,660
according to the shape of this gossip?

818
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,180
Maybe there's a dragon at the bottom of the well.

819
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,340
It's going to be a dragon

820
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,500
to be held by this gossip.

821
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,100
Look.

822
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,220
It's really scary

823
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,020
around here.

824
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,420
They're all evil dragons.

825
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,340
What evil dragon?

826
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,220
Your explanation is reasonable.

827
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,500
I'll just say it.

828
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,020
You guys always talk in a gentle way.

829
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,220
I really don't understand.

830
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,500
Just tell me

831
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,060
what's the use of the Dragon-locking Mirror?

832
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,860
This should be the mechanism array of the ancient people.

833
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,340
If my guess is right,

834
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,620
the Dragon-locking Mirror is used to control water.

835
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,220
I've seen

836
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,780
related magic in the Crystal Pillar.

837
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,340
In the yin and yang of this gossip,

838
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,660
there are hidden spring eyes and sea eyes.

839
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
The dragon of the ancient people

840
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,340
is a water monster.

841
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,020
Thousands of years ago,

842
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,900
this place should have often erupted into a mountain lake.

843
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,340
And this gossip array

844
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,700
is to attract the flow

845
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,900
and send the flood into the sea.

846
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
Didn't you say before

847
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,740
that the stone tablet

848
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,420
would be constantly changing?

849
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,020
It's not because there's a ghost behind the stone tablet.

850
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,620
It's because the bottom of the stone tablet

851
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,500
has a kind of barrier mechanism.

852
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,500
According to the tide of the sea,

853
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,940
the mechanism will affect

854
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,540
the location of the stone tablet.

855
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,540
I see.

856
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,780
So it's the sea that's the ghost.

857
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,180
Then, sir,

858
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,460
how did you find out?

859
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,500
Hey,

860
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,060
it's so far from the sea.

861
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,220
Why do you think

862
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,620
it's caused by the tide?

863
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,060
Has he been killed yet?

864
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,180
Maybe.

865
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,180
Perhaps he mastermind I and disappeared.

866
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:14,580
But there was no goddamn
