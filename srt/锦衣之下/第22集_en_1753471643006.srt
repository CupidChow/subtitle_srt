1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If the smoke can't go side-by-side

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
Think of someone to be your mercy

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,880
Don't let him find you

4
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,980
My favorite

5
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,280
Let him be a soldier

6
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,040
Not a man

7
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,520
only to enrich me.

8
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,680
Doctor.

9
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,920
Are you going to collect herbs?

10
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,920
Come on.

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
Let me help you.

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,920
I'll collect herbs as you want.

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
I'll help you.

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,720
Luckily, you didn't refuse me.

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm afraid that I can't see you

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,880
when the night falls.

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,600
Remember.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,760
When you find the doctor,

19
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,920
you must be careful.

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,960
He doesn't like to talk too much.

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,360
I'd better be quiet

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
in case the doctor will feel disgusted with me.

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,560
Let me help you.

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,160
You want this?

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,160
Let me help you.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,320
I'll do it.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,160
I'll do it.

28
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,760
Don't move.

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,720
Let me help you.

30
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Be careful.

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't break the root.

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,320
Water.

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Water.

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
Water.

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,840
Water.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,600
Water.

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,320
Water.

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,520
Don't be afraid.

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,760
Although these snakes are poisonous,

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,440
they won't hurt you.

41
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,800
You raised these poisonous things?

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,440
What a pity.

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
It looks like a fairy,

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,160
but it hides dangers everywhere.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Let me help you.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,640
Don't move.

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,400
Let me help you.

48
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,400
Be careful.

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,160
It's okay.

50
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,120
Jinxia and the others came here.

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Really?

52
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
This is the mark

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,440
Jinxia left.

54
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,800
That way.

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll go to Zhu Fa.

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,920
The smell of herbs is so good.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,760
It's the smell of these herbs.

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,160
Do you understand?

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,240
What do you mean?

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,480
Aren't you curious

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,880
why there are so many poisonous things here?

62
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,880
You mean

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,960
the poisonous things are the smell of these herbs?

64
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,880
Yes.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,480
Let me do it.

66
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,080
Give it to me.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,960
Let me do it.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,720
Tell me.

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
What do you need?

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,160
Let me do it.

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,880
You clean these roots

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
with water.

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,440
Then put them on the shelf.

74
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,480
Okay.

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,080
Water.

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,040
Hold on.

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,760
Hold hold.

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,280
Got it.

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,440
Your Highness.

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,960
Let me do it.

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,840
Grand holes.

82
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
Your Highness,

83
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
what're you doing?

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,520
Don't move.

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Let me do it.

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,640
Hold on.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
I'll go.

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I'll go.

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,160
The spring water by the river...

90
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Here we are.

91
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Wait a minute.

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
What?

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Did you forget to bring your things?

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Do you want to go to the beach?

95
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I also want to go to the beach.

96
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
I'll give you a ride.

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
I'll take you there.

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
I'll take you there.

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I'll take you there.

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I'll give you a ride.

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I'll take you there.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
What?

103
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
What's wrong?

104
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
This is the secret watch that Jin Xia left.

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
We didn't go in the wrong direction.

106
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Let's go.

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Let's go.

108
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I'm back.

109
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Wait.

110
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Don't pour it yet.

111
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
This water can't be used.

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Go get two more barrels of water.

113
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
You can only use spring water.

114
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Oh.

115
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Yin Xiang.

116
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Look.

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Is it okay?

118
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
No.

119
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
I can't go any further.

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
I can't go any further.

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
I'll go get another one.

122
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
You...

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Yes.

124
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,160
He's not satisfied with so many barrels of water.

125
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
What does he want?

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Aren't these all the same water?

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Master fell asleep.

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
So he needs to calm down.

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Observe.

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Judgment.

131
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
He even said that he's good at tracking.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
He almost ruined his own factory.

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Water.

134
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Is there anything special about using water?

135
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
The water just came out of the well.

136
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
It won't be dirty without flowing.

137
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Is this the spring water that Yin Xian wants?

138
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Yin Xian.

139
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Is this okay?

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
It's okay.

141
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Pour it in.

142
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Thank goodness.

143
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I finally know

144
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
what spring water you want.

145
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
It's the water that just came out of the well.

146
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
It's okay.

147
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
It's okay.

148
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
It's okay.

149
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
It's okay.

150
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
It's okay.

151
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
It's okay.

152
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
It's okay.

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
It's okay.

154
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
It's okay.

155
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
It's okay.

156
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
It's okay.

157
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I was wrong to hit the river.

158
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Are you blaming me

159
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
for not making it clear to you?

160
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
No, no, no.

161
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I was too stupid.

162
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
I was wrong about what you meant.

163
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Two buckets of water is not enough.

164
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Get two more buckets of water.

165
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Okay.

166
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
He is so persistent.

167
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
He is really like a person.

168
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Okay.

169
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Lan Ye.

170
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
You are a good singer.

171
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
There is no one in the whole capital

172
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
who can match you.

173
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
If you change your mind

174
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
and take me back to the capital to serve you,

175
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I will accompany you every day.

176
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
You'd better stay here.

177
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
I will go back to the capital later.

178
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
You need to take care of things here.

179
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Yes.

180
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Keep an eye on Mao Haifeng for me.

181
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
If he makes any small movements,

182
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
let me know immediately.

183
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Don't worry, young master.

184
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
What you told me is

185
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
that I will do my best.

186
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
One more song.

187
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Okay.

188
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Time is getting shorter.

189
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Doctor.

190
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Just call Dr. Lin.

191
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Dr. Lin, please check him.

192
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Okay.

193
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
How is he?

194
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
He just needs to step on one foot

195
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
and he will be in the coffin.

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Doctor.

197
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Dr. Lin.

198
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I beg you.

199
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Please save him.

200
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
I beg you.

201
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Save him.

202
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Go to the forest and catch some snakes.

203
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,140
And put them in the

204
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
house outside the door.

205
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Snakes?

206
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Okay.

207
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Any snakes will do, right?

208
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Do you dare to catch big snakes?

209
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Let me see.

210
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Small snakes will do.

211
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I know.

212
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Although the girl is young,

213
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
she is very patient.

214
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Very affectionate.

215
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Flying fish leg.

216
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Have you given her any medicine?

217
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Purple medicine.

218
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
The hand gun you just used

219
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
is the fire weapon of the officials.

220
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
The hand gun?

221
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
It's the Imperial Guards.

222
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Master.

223
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Master.

224
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Father.

225
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Master.

226
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
Father.

227
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Master.

228
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Master.

229
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Kill them.

230
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
It's Uncle Gai.

231
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Senior sister.

232
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I found it.

233
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Uncle Gai.

234
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Don't say.

235
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
The code of this girl is really useful.

236
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
I found it all.

237
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Where are Jinxia and others?

238
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Jinxia?

239
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
She went to find the doctor of the first line with Lu Yi.

240
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
There.

241
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Let me tell you.

242
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
In the forest of Feng Liyao,

243
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
it's very dangerous.

244
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm afraid that they will be killed.

245
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I'm afraid that they will be killed.

246
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
It's very dangerous in the forest.

247
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Don't run around.

248
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Lu Yi and Jinxia can enter.

249
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Why can't I enter?

250
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Besides,

251
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
don't you worry about their safety?

252
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
And

253
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
they saved your life from the Suolong well.

254
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Do you forget?

255
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I...

256
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
I'm worried.

257
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
But

258
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
you can't go in.

259
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
I can't care so much.

260
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
No.

261
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Why don't you listen to me?

262
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
What do you mean?

263
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Are you hiding something from me?

264
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I'm really afraid that you will be in danger.

265
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Don't you believe me, okay?

266
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Xie Xiao, calm down.

267
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
I'm Yang Yue.

268
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm Jinxia's colleague.

269
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Jinxia has been with you for so long.

270
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Will something happen?

271
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
I guess

272
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
they have found the doctor.

273
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Maybe

274
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
they have started to treat.

275
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
So

276
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
don't worry.

277
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Just like me,

278
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
wait here.

279
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Don't ruin

280
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
the peace in the Suolong well.

281
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
What if they are angry

282
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
and don't want to save my grandson?

283
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
It will be a disaster.

284
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
No.

285
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm worried about Jinxia.

286
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Uncle Gai.

287
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
You know that place.

288
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Come with us.

289
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Go.

290
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Uncle Gai, let's go.

291
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
What are you doing?

292
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Go.

293
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Let me go.

294
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Uncle Gai.

295
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Don't yell.

296
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
It's not good for you to do this.

297
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Uncle Gai.

298
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Don't move.

299
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Dr. Lin, I got the wound you wanted.

300
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Hold it.

301
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
The wound

302
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
can't be healed, right?

303
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Yes.

304
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Give me the snake.

305
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Okay.

306
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Hurry.

307
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
How is it, Dr. Lin?

308
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Is the poison already cured?

309
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
It's more powerful

310
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
than I thought.

311
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Then...

312
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
This poison is very powerful.

313
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,160
If you give it to me for a while,

314
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
maybe I can

315
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
cure it.

316
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Okay.

317
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Go.

318
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Go.

319
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Go.

320
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Go.

321
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Go.

322
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Go.

323
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Go.

324
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Go.

325
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Go.

326
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Go.

327
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Go.

328
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Go.

329
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Go.

330
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Go.

331
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Go.

332
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Go.

333
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Maybe I can

334
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
find a way to cure it.

335
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
But now he's dying.

336
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I'm afraid that...

337
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
No.

338
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
The lord said

339
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
he's not a short-lived man.

340
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Doctor,

341
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
you must have a way to save him, right?

342
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Your highness.

343
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
I know you must have a way to save him.

344
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I beg you.

345
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Please save him.

346
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
He can't die.

347
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
I beg you.

348
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I beg you.

349
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Get up first.

350
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
There is a way.

351
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
But it's very dangerous.

352
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
It's very expensive.

353
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Maybe you can save him

354
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
and another life.

355
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
So he may die.

356
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
What do you mean?

357
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
The poison in his body has entered the high desert.

358
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
It's the only way to stop it.

359
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Only by detoxifying his blood

360
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
can we save his life.

361
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Defecting his blood?

362
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Where is it?

363
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
I'll find it.

364
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
It's not that easy to get.

365
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
I know.

366
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
To detoxify his blood,

367
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
we must put the poison

368
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
into the blood of the living.

369
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
The poison is the medicine.

370
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
The blood is the medicine.

371
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Then the blood is purified.

372
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Then the blood is purified.

373
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,160
The patient can only be detoxified for three days

374
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
to detoxify his body.

375
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Do you understand what I mean?

376
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
You want the medicine?

377
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Yes.

378
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
I'm going to the hospital.

379
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
I'll call you when I arrive.

380
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Okay.

381
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
See you.

382
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
I don't know if you're lucky or not.

383
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
This golden snake

384
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
is the son of the King of Poison.

385
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,160
I thought the King of Poison had been eliminated.

386
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
But I accidentally found an egg

387
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
and hatched it.

388
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
This golden snake

389
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
is the most important poison

390
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
in the hundred poisons I mentioned.

391
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Without it,

392
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
your beloved husband

393
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
would have died.

394
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
I'm so lucky.

395
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Lucky?

396
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Do you know that to make this medicine,

397
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,160
you have to let this golden snake bite you?

398
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
If it bites me,

399
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
what will happen to my body?

400
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
There will be no reaction at the moment.

401
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,160
But if the snake poison is really strong,

402
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,160
it will be paralyzed in a few days.

403
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Then it will spread all over the body.

404
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
It will be difficult to breathe in the end.

405
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
It can't walk.

406
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Can we still save our lives?

407
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Everyone has different ability to bear it.

408
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
If there's really a problem,

409
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I can only say I tried my best.

410
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
But I can't guarantee that

411
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
the poisoners will be killed.

412
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Yuan Jin Xia,

413
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
are you really going to risk your life for your husband?

414
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I was just excited for a moment.

415
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
But now I think about it,

416
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
you haven't found your family yet.

417
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Your mother is still waiting for you in the capital.

418
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
You don't even have a loved one.

419
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
What if you die like this?

420
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Are you willing to do it?

421
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
You were just a good person before.

422
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,160
You hit your head with a handgun.

423
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
What?

424
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Now you're hesitating?

425
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
To be honest,

426
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,160
I was able to control the handgun at that time

427
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
because it was in my hand.

428
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
So you were acting.

429
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Yes.

430
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
But I didn't expect that he would rush out of the house

431
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
and scare me.

432
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
So he...

433
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
You dare to lie to me.

434
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
I'm sorry, Dr. Lin.

435
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
I lied to you.

436
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
But he didn't.

437
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
You can punish me if you want.

438
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Please, save him.

439
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I can save him,

440
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
but I may not save you.

441
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Save you?

442
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Have you thought it through?

443
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Let's go.

444
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Where are we going now?

445
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
I'm hungry.

446
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Let's eat something.

447
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Although you're cold and cold sometimes,

448
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
you're not kind and annoying,

449
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,160
but sometimes you're very warm.

450
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Sir, Wang Qianqian.

451
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
You want to die?

452
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
I'm afraid that Lord Yan doesn't want to take you.

453
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
You...

454
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
You...

455
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Besides,

456
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
if it weren't for you,

457
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
I would have died long ago.

458
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
Yuan Qianxia,

459
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
what are you thinking?

460
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
I asked you to rescue you from the Ghost Gate,

461
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
but you refused to save me.

462
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Do you want to be unhappy for the rest of your life?

463
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Besides,

464
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Dr. Lin said it was serious as Lord Yan's medicine.

465
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
But I believe he will save me.

466
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
So it may not be a failure.

467
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,160
But if no one helps him make blood,

468
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
he will die.

469
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
It's too late.

470
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Have you made up your mind?

471
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
If you want to die, die together.

472
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
If you want to live, live together.

473
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
I want to live with you.

474
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Does it hurt so much?

475
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Does it hurt so much?

476
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
It's scary.

477
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Brother Qi.

478
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Be careful.

479
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Don't cut your tongue.

480
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Jinxia.

481
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Jinxia.

482
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Jinxia.

483
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Let's take a break.

484
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
So many snakes.

485
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
We can't finish them all.

486
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
We can't do it.

487
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Why do you grab my pot?

488
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
No.

489
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
What are you doing?

490
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Take it.

491
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
What are you doing?

492
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,160
I want to set fire to burn this forest.

493
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Set fire.

494
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Hurry.

495
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Go back to your room.

496
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Go.

497
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
You bastard.

498
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
You almost got into trouble.

499
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Is there any other way?

500
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Oh, no.

501
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Oh, no.

502
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
We are in trouble.

503
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Run.

504
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Run.

505
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Stop.

506
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Stop.

507
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Are you the owner of this forest?

508
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Yes.

509
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Then you must be the doctor.

510
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
I'm Yang Yue.

511
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm here to find my sister.

512
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I offended you just now.

513
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Please forgive me.

514
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Your sister?

515
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Yes.

516
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Her sister asked someone to leave a message.

517
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
She said she was here to find the doctor.

518
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Have you seen them?

519
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
So what?

520
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
You set fire to burn this forest?

521
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Thank you.

522
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
I set fire to burn this forest.

523
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
I can bear it alone.

524
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
As long as you take us to see Jin Xia.

525
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
You almost ruined my favorite forest.

526
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
You even bargain with me.

527
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
How do you want to bear it?

528
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I...

529
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Doctor, we are also looking for people in a hurry.

530
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
We will compensate for all the losses here.

531
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Yes.

532
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Come out.

533
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
You brought them here?

534
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Yes.

535
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Ling.

536
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I know your habit.

537
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
But I have no other way.

538
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
These years,

540
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
I've been looking for you.

541
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
But I dare not.

542
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Come with me.

543
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Let's go.

544
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Let's go.

545
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Senior.

546
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Yuan.

547
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Jin Xia.

548
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Xie Yuan.

549
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Jin Xia.

550
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Sister Shangguan.

551
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Why are you here?

552
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Of course, because someone brought us here.

553
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Uncle.

554
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Girl.

555
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
You brought them here?

556
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
They forced us.

557
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
We can't stop them.

558
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Didn't you bring Lu Yi here?

559
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Where is he?

560
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
He is inside.

561
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
I'll take you to see him.

562
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Okay.

563
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I'm not here to find Lu Yi.

564
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
I'm worried about you.

565
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
You have never been afraid of the sky or the ground.

566
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
You are afraid of snakes.

567
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
There are so many poisonous snakes in the forest.

568
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
You are not scared, are you?

569
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
How could it be?

570
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Just a few snakes.

571
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
A few snakes won't be afraid of you.

572
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Otherwise, you can't be a fast-repeater.

573
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Right.

574
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Right.

575
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
By the way, Zaya.

576
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Although I left a mark,

577
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
I didn't expect you to find the book so soon.

578
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
You are making progress in the investigation.

579
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
I'm worried about you.

580
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
I'm relieved to see you are fine.

581
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
I'm fine.

582
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
But,

583
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Mr. Lu is not good.

584
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
I'm afraid he can't cure the poison.

585
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
You are talking about Mr. Lu.

586
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
You are talking about Mr. Lu.

587
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
When did you become so concerned about him?

588
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
I think the doctor here is not good.

589
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
How about we go back to Yangzhou?

590
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
The doctors in Yangzhou are so generous.

591
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
They can cure any poison.

592
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Let's not waste time.

593
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Let's go now.

594
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Xie Yuanyuan.

595
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Don't talk nonsense.

596
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Mr. Lu is not a normal poison.

597
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Only the medical fairy can save him.

598
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Don't go.

599
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Doctor Lin.

600
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
My junior brother never knows how to talk.

601
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
If there is an offense,

602
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
I apologize to you.

603
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
I'm sorry.

604
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
I heard you are good at medicine.

605
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I believe that as long as you are here,

606
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Mr. Lu will be cured.

607
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Don't be so formal.

608
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
It's not the end of the world.

609
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
It depends on his luck.

610
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Yes.

611
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
He is not so formal.

612
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
There is no poison that you can't cure.

613
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
This poison is so strange.

614
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,160
I don't know who is the crazy person who can make it.

615
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
It's my first time to see it.

616
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
I'm not sure.

617
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Lin.

618
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
You are good at poison.

619
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Why don't you follow me to see it later?

620
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,160
See what poison Mr. Lu is talking about.

621
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Maybe you have seen it.

622
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
No need.

623
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
That poison is from the book.

624
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
What?

625
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
It's you.

626
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Come with me.

627
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
No.

628
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I can't go alone.

629
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Don't talk nonsense.

630
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Go.

631
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Yuan Daxiang.

632
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
This is the medical fairy you mentioned.

633
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Why is it so different?

634
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Don't talk nonsense.

635
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
I think she is not good at it.

636
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
She can't save Lu Yi.

637
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
And there are poisonous things in the forest.

638
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
If she is poisonous to us,

639
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
we won't have a place to hide.

640
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Yes.

641
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
She is hiding here alone.

642
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
She is not afraid of so many poisonous things.

643
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
It's really strange.

644
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
If she is not a person from the Yan family,

645
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
she must have some secret.

646
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I thought about it before.

647
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
She is the reason for this.

648
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
But aren't all the masters sleeping?

649
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
What's wrong with you, Yuan Daxiang?

650
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

651
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Do you want to go back to your room?

652
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
I want to talk with you.

653
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
I'm fine.

654
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm fine.

655
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Xie Xiao.

656
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
How about you and Shangguan and Dayang?

657
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
You go back to Yangzhou.

658
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
I'll take care of Master Lu.

659
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
I won't go back.

660
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Why did I meet someone

661
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
who is worse than me?

662
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Where are you going?

663
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
I'm going to see how Master Lu is doing.

664
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
I'll go with you.

665
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Xie Xiao, can you stop making trouble here?

666
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
After Master Lu's poison is gone,

667
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I'll go back to Yangzhou and meet you.

668
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Lu Yi is a little bit of a follower.

669
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
He won't show up when Master is in trouble.

670
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
So I said, Yuan Daxiang,

671
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
you don't have to spend so much time

672
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
to take care of him.

673
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Master Lu was poisoned to save me.

674
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
I should take care of him in all circumstances.

675
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
What's wrong?

676
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Are you cold or what?

677
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Why are you so cold?

678
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
What's wrong with you?

679
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Yuan Jinxia.

680
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Miss Shangguan.

681
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Are you okay?

682
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Don't follow me.

683
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm fine.

684
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
I just caught a cold.

685
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I'll go to see Dr. Lin.

686
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
He'll just eat some dry grass.

687
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
No, no, no. I'll go with you.

688
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Can you stop following me?

689
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
If you keep following me, I'll hit you.

690
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Then I'll go see Master Lu.

691
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
He's not feeling well.

692
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Don't bother him.

693
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
And your senior is angry.

694
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Can't you see it?

695
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
I'll go with you.

696
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
I'll go with you.

697
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Go.

698
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Go.

699
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Ling'er.

700
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
I was wondering how they could

701
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
get into the fengling forest to find me.

702
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
It's you.

703
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
Ling'er.

704
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
I know you don't like

705
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
to interact with outsiders.

706
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
But it's urgent to do something.

707
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
That kid was poisoned.

708
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
I can't bear to see him die.

709
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
I can't even stop him from following me.

710
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
You're the one who made the hole.

711
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
You can't clean it up yourself.

712
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
And you're pushing me here.

713
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Who do you think I am?

714
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
I know you have a way.

715
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Wu Jie.

716
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Really, Wu Jie?

717
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
Wu Jie.

718
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Ling'er.

719
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Do you remember

720
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
the bet we made that year?

721
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
The poison at that time

722
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
is not something I can't cure.

723
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
If I can't cure the poison

724
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
you can't cure.

725
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Then I'll make you a wish.

726
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Really?

727
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Any wish is fine.

728
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Of course it's true.

729
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Don't regret it.

730
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
What's there to regret?

731
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Okay.

732
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
It's a deal.

733
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I remember that year

734
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
we followed Master.

735
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
I learned to cure the poison.

736
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
You learned to detoxify the poison.

737
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
We always competed against each other.

738
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
But

739
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
you're smarter than me.

740
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Every time I cure the poison

741
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
you can break it.

742
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
So Master

743
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
especially values you.

744
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
You were the first doctor, right?

745
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
I just want to ask you

746
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
if you can cure the poison

747
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
or not.

748
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Can you cure the poison

749
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
of Lan Yu Zan?

750
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Ling'er.

751
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
If you can't cure the poison

752
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
you promised me

753
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
you would marry me.

754
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Even so

755
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
you shouldn't leave the sect.

756
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
I was young

757
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
and impulsive.

758
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
I just wanted to win you.

759
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
I wandered the world

760
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
to find the most poisonous thing.

761
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Finally

762
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
someone who is not as good as me

763
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
made me cure the poison.

764
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
But I know

765
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
there must be something wrong

766
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
with the poison.

767
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
So I kept it.

768
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Even if you kept it

769
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
the poison on that child

770
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
wouldn't be so hard to cure.

771
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
It's just an accident.

772
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
The poison on him

773
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
is on the basis of my poison.

774
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
It's on the basis of my poison.

775
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
It's on the basis of my poison.

776
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
So I can't cure it.

777
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
When he was poisoned

778
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
the first thing I thought of

779
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
was you.

780
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Because I knew

781
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
you could cure it.

782
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
I don't want to

783
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
fight with you.

784
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
You are my last hope.

785
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
To cure the poison

786
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
we have to test the poison with people

787
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
and use his blood

788
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
as a medicine.

789
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Test the poison?

790
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
That's dangerous.

791
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Are you going to use Jinxia

792
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
as your medicine?

793
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Yes.

794
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
How could you do that?

795
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
He sent it himself.

796
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
I didn't force him.

797
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
It's been years

798
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
but you've become so cruel.

799
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
You use Jinxia as your medicine?

800
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
You said I was cruel.

801
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
You know I never

802
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
treat people with care.

803
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
What's more,

804
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
the one lying there is a guard.

805
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Have you forgotten?

806
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Ling'er.

807
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
You can't harm Jinxia.

808
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Ling'er.

809
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
I beg you.

810
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Jinxia is right.

811
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm sorry.

812
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
I'm sorry.

813
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I have a savior.

814
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Don't let anything happen to her.

815
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Okay?

816
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
It's all for this.

817
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
I can only say I'll try my best.

818
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
As for the result,

819
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
it's up to God.

820
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Go.

821
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
Go.

822
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Dr. Lin.

823
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
What's wrong?

824
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Sit down.

825
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,360
I'm cold and hot now.

826
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,840
My chest is still full.

827
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,520
I can't breathe.

828
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,920
Now I can't even

829
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,880
hold it.

830
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,080
Take this medicine.

831
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,240
It can relieve the poison in your body.

832
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,040
After three meals a day,

833
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,000
take it six times a day.

834
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,360
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

835
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,120
Can my tongue be cured?

836
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,160
After three days,

837
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,000
when he gets better,

838
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,400
I can cure you.

839
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,400
Here.

840
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,760
Give me your hand.

841
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,560
Take this to him.

842
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,640
Make sure he drinks it all.

843
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
Don't waste time.

844
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,960
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

845
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,280
Uncle Han, you're here too.

846
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,120
You're here too.

847
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,680
Here.

848
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,560
Slowly.

849
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,880
It's done.

850
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,440
Okay.

851
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Let me help him up.

852
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,120
He's heavy.

853
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,160
Here.

854
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,840
Feed him.

855
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,000
He can't drink it without a mouth.

856
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,560
What should we do?

857
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,200
Here.

858
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,400
Let me put his mouth here.

859
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,840
Here. Try again.

860
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:14,960
No.

861
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,680
I want to spill it.

862
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,480
I spilled it.

863
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,000
What should I do?

864
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,600
What should we do?

865
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,400
Sir.

866
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,920
You can't drink medicine.

867
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,640
Try again.

868
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
Try again.

869
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,280
Try again.

870
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,360
Open your mouth.

871
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,200
Be a good boy.

872
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,520
It's not good to take medicine.

873
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,280
Little boy.

874
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,040
You must take medicine.

875
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,880
Open your mouth.

876
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,400
Open your mouth.

877
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,000
Open your mouth.

878
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,560
Sir.

879
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,680
No.

880
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,640
Still no.

881
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,520
Still no?

882
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,240
What should I do?

883
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,720
What should you do?

884
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,400
How about this?

885
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,840
You can take his mouth.

886
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Take his mouth?

887
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
I'm here.

888
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,280
Who is born out of the world

889
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,720
is better than fate.

890
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
Close your eyes.

891
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,160
I can see your face.

892
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,440
Open your eyes.

893
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
The back is dark.

894
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,320
The sword is full of sweet.

895
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,040
In the mortal world,

896
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,040
who has the power to fight against the wind?

897
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,520
No sound.

898
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,800
The dark cloud is rising.

899
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,000
The fate is turning.

900
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,600
It's a change of time.

901
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,560
It's like parting.

902
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,200
The parting is too deep.

903
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:18,680
The willow is golden.

904
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,400
The day I met you,

905
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,960
my hair turned white.

906
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,720
We spent years together.

907
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,600
In the dream,

908
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,600
a word is said.
