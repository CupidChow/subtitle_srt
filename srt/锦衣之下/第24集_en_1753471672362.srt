So cold

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,760
So cold

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,200
I feel repetitive

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mother.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Be careful.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Mom, mom, mom.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Mom, mom.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mom.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mom.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mom.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mom.

81
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,500
Go, orchestral Democratic他是

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,320
I didn't expect

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,760
As soon as I saw it

84
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,660
A million dollars

85
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,500
a thousand dollars

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,200
A billion

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,140
Dashing

88
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,940
This is

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
Jinxia.

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,960
Jinxia.

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,440
Jinxia.

92
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Mr. Lu.

93
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,320
Why are you here?

94
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,800
Who do you think I am?

95
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,760
It's good that you're here

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,640
with me.

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,920
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
Sir.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,160
You must promise me

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
to change the world in your heart.

101
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
Please.

102
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,800
Impossible.

103
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,480
If you don't take responsibility

104
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
and leave here

105
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
do you want to be a whore?

106
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I won't give you a penny.

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
Sir.

108
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
You can't be a white-eyed wolf.

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
How can I not save you?

110
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,760
You're the one who made your own appearance.

111
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,800
I don't need anyone else to change my life.

112
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,560
I've already changed it.

113
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
It's good that

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,960
we don't have to be close anymore.

115
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,400
My mom said that I was a bad person since I was a child.

116
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,160
So I had to live with her.

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,680
I've been a bad person for several times.

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,400
I was so scared that I couldn't die.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,480
I didn't expect that

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
I would die

121
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,280
just to save you.

122
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
But

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,160
Sir.

124
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,400
If God

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,200
really takes me in

126
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,680
don't feel guilty.

127
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,080
I'm willing to do it.

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Master.

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
You're so beautiful.

130
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,800
Do you want me to eat something?

131
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,080
Or you want me to eat pork?

132
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Do you want it?

133
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,600
I don't know

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
but some food here looks delicious.

135
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,840
I have to do it.

136
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,520
Your Highness.

137
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,800
Okay, show it to them.

138
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
This is for you.

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
My lord, this...

140
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm so grateful for my mother's clothes.

141
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
I just take it as a souvenir.

142
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Now I give it to you.

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
You must cherish it.

144
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
The sky has fallen down.

145
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
I feel so sad.

146
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I feel so relieved.

147
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,280
My lord, you've been working for a whole day.

148
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
I'll give you a massage.

149
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
My lord, I'll massage your head.

150
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
It's comfortable.

151
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
My lord.

152
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
You can't lose such an important thing.

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Take it.

154
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
My lord, you hide here.

155
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'll lure them to you.

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Hide.

157
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Go back.

158
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
I hope we can try it.

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
My lord, you take it first.

160
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I give you this.

161
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I won't let you die.

162
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
My mother died.

163
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
The string is broken.

164
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I always take the string with mother's blood.

165
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
I'll try it.

166
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Take it as a souvenir.

167
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
My lord, you don't want to leave him or me?

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Jinxia.

169
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Jinxia.

170
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Jinxia.

171
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Jinxia.

172
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Jinxia.

173
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
How are you, Jinxia?

174
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
You're all here.

175
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
You're not lonely when I leave.

176
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm lonely because I have friends to send me.

177
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
What are you talking about?

178
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Jinxia, you won't die.

179
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
What are you doing?

180
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Don't be like this.

181
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
I hate this atmosphere.

182
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
My lord.

183
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
You can't leave me.

184
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Otherwise, I'll go back.

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I'll take off my skin.

186
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
And your mother.

187
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Your mother is waiting for you at home.

188
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
My mother.

189
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
My lord.

190
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
You must give me the string.

191
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
You still mention about the silver.

192
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Jinxia.

193
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Jinxia, what's wrong with you?

194
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
Jinxia.

195
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Jinxia.

196
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Jinxia.

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Doctor Lin.

198
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Doctor Lin, look at her.

199
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Meier, hurry.

200
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Doctor Lin, how is she?

201
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I'll try my best.

202
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I'll give her some medicine.

203
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Doctor, let me talk to her.

204
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Jinxia, you must hold on.

205
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Jinxia is in this situation.

206
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
She wants to die.

207
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Unless there's a miracle.

208
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
My lord.

209
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
If I die one day.

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Will you be sad?

211
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
My lord.

212
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
You must hold on.

213
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Jinxia.

214
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
You have to hold on.

215
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
You have to hold on.

216
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
OK.

217
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Doctor.

218
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
OK.

219
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Jinxia.

220
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Jinxia.

221
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
How many times did you capture it?

222
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Not even once.

223
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
This is the last way I could find from the medical book.

224
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I can only read it.

225
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
The last way?

226
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
There is a ancient prescription in the medical book.

227
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,200
It's a medicine made from seven poisonous herbs.

228
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
It's used to poison.

229
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
But the poison of this herb is very strong.

230
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Plus, I haven't used this prescription before.

231
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I don't know if it can be tolerated.

232
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
It seems that we can only bet on it.

233
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Jin Xia's life,

234
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I believe she can get through it.

235
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
It's all up to her luck.

236
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Let me do it.

237
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Jin Xia,

238
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
you must get through it.

239
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I still have to take you to eat something delicious.

240
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
The medicine is coming.

241
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Move aside.

242
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Let me do it.

243
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
It spilled.

244
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
It's hot.

245
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Let me do it.

246
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Jin Xia.

247
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Jin Xia.

248
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Jin Xia.

249
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Jin Xia.

250
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Dr. Lin, what's going on?

251
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Why is it not getting better?

252
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
How could Jin Xia be like this?

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I made this medicine from seven poisonous herbs.

254
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
It's very toxic.

255
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
After drinking it,

256
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
the medicine will make her feel better.

257
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
It's not good.

258
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
It's not good.

259
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
It's not good.

260
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,200
The medicine will slow her blood flow.

261
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Her heart is normal.

262
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
But her body will freeze to the ground.

263
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Will she be able to get through it?

264
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
It's all up to her luck.

265
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Dr. Lin.

266
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Dr. Lin.

267
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Is there any other way?

268
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I never believed in God.

269
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
But this time,

270
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,200
I really hope you can be a fairy.

271
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Jin Xia.

272
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Jin Xia.

273
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Jin Xia.

274
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Jin Xia.

275
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Jin Xia.

276
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Jin Xia.

277
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Jin Xia.

278
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Jin Xia.

279
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Jin Xia.

280
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Jin Xia.

281
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Jin Xia.

282
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Jin Xia.

283
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Jin Xia.

284
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Jin Xia.

285
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Jin Xia.

286
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Leave it.

287
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,700
Wait until they're done.

288
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
You should ask that.

289
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I'll leave it to you.

290
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I know that you and Jinxia have a brother and sister relationship.

291
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
You're one of the colleagues.

292
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,200
When you see her sick, you'll be very sad.

293
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Although we can't bear to part,

294
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
life and death are destined.

295
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
We'll be blessed with wealth.

296
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You...

297
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Do you think that I'm useless now?

298
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I spent a lot of time healing myself

299
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,200
to calm down when Xie Xiao ran away from the wedding.

300
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
I know that I'm useless now.

301
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
But as long as Jinxia is still alive,

302
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
there's still hope.

303
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Isn't that right?

304
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Take it.

305
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Dry your tears.

306
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
If Jinxia wakes up and sees you like this,

307
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
she'll be even sadder than you.

308
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Jinxia

309
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Your Majesty.

310
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
You seem to be in a bad mood.

311
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Why don't you rest for a while?

312
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
We'll see later.

313
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
No need.

314
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,200
I can't rest until I see these annoying things.

315
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Go.

316
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Bring me the elixir that Dan Qingge sent me.

317
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Yes.

318
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Your Majesty.

319
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Slow down.

320
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Your Majesty.

321
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Your Majesty.

322
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Someone, come here.

323
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Your Majesty.

324
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Your Majesty.

325
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Hurry.

326
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Go to the doctor.

327
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Your Majesty.

328
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Sir, Eunuch Lu wants to see you.

329
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Commander Lu,

330
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
His Majesty suddenly fainted after taking the elixir

331
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
that Dan Qingge made.

332
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
His Majesty fainted?

333
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Yes.

334
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
The palace is in chaos now.

335
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
The people of the Imperial Medical Bureau

336
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
are all called to the outside to take care of him.

337
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Qin Fu,

338
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
summon the Imperial Guard Jingrui to the palace to protect him.

339
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Yes.

340
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Wanxing,

341
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
you're safe.

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
That's great.

343
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Good.

344
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
It's good that he's awake.

345
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
He's worried about his death.

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
A man must have a future.

347
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
I'll go get the elixir.

348
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Senior, let's go.

349
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Let's go together.

350
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Mother.

351
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Jinxia.

352
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Jinxia, you're awake.

353
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Jinxia, you're finally awake.

354
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Doctor Lin said

355
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
you're safe.

356
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
You've been lying for so long.

357
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
You must be hungry.

358
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Tell me what you want to eat.

359
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I'll cook for you.

360
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I want to eat meat.

361
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Meat?

362
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Okay.

363
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll cook a chicken for you.

364
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
No.

365
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Doctor Lin

366
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
seems to have only been given a fruit.

367
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
There's no health.

368
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
How about

369
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I go get some wild plants for you?

370
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Wait for me.

371
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Wait for me to come back.

372
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I'll go.

373
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Jinxia,

374
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
wild chicken, wild duck,

375
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
wild rabbit, wild pig.

376
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
What kind of food do you want?

377
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I want to eat wild food.

378
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I want to eat wild food.

379
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Tell me what you want to eat.

380
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I'll get it for you.

381
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Yang Bukui,

382
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
wait for me in the kitchen.

383
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Okay.

384
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Go back quickly.

385
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Grab the bigger one.

386
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Okay.

387
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Great.

388
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
I'll help you.

389
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Okay.

390
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Sir,

391
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
you told me not to die.

392
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I really didn't die

393
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,200
while I was guarding this bracelet.

394
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
But the gold is gone.

395
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
How about a large sum of silver?

396
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
It's good that you didn't die.

397
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
From now on,

398
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I'll give you five times more.

399
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Thank you, sir.

400
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
I'm so sorry

401
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
for my mother's death.

402
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I just take it as a souvenir.

403
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Now I'll give you this souvenir.

404
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Cherish it.

405
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Sorry for my impoliteness.

406
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Is this bracelet

407
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,200
a token of your love?

408
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
A token of my love?

409
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
It's really yours.

410
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
For the rest of your life.

411
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
My love,

412
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
thisolp fen.

413
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
It makes you forget everything.

414
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Baby,

415
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
father,

416
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
no idea

417
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
but S interfering me

418
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
drives me crazy.

419
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Because

420
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I can only

421
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
ask you so many times.

422
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
More often request for

423
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
one more big lover

424
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I'm really sorry.

425
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
But I want to be mine.

426
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't have a chance to be the one who does that.

427
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
When His Majesty is strong,

428
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,520
we will have the chance to reconcile with him

429
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
and have beef with him.

430
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,480
Father's words to you.

431
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,680
Master Di has come out.

432
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,600
Master Ian has come.

433
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
How is His Majesty?

434
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,880
How is His Majesty's body?

435
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
He just woke up.

436
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,880
He woke up.

437
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,880
His Majesty is here to see you.

438
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
His Majesty.

439
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
Yan Genlong, slow down.

440
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Lord Lu.

441
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
Yan Genlong, slow down.

442
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Lord Lu, slow down.

443
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,880
His Majesty.

444
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,880
His Majesty is in danger.

445
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,160
I am so scared.

446
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I should repay His Majesty's kindness.

447
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,160
As a subject, I failed to protect His Majesty.

448
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,160
So I had to use the medicine to frame His Majesty.

449
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Please punish me.

450
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
It has nothing to do with love.

451
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
You may all rise.

452
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

453
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
His Majesty is wise.

454
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
I am loyal to His Majesty.

455
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
I can see that.

456
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Besides, His Majesty used to take this medicine.

457
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
There is nothing wrong with it.

458
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Did someone change the medicine?

459
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,440
I have my own plan.

460
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Xu Aiqing, before this matter is clear,

461
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,440
you should stay in the mansion for now.

462
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
I am not guilty.

463
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,720
I will let His Majesty decide.

464
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
You may rise.

465
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

466
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,720
If you have nothing to say,

467
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
you may leave.

468
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I will leave.

469
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Lu Aiqing,

470
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
you should stay.

471
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Your Majesty.

472
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Lu Aiqing,

473
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
what do you think of this matter?

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Your Majesty,

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think you are right.

476
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
His Majesty has been taking the medicine for years.

477
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If he has something to do,

478
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
he would have taken the action.

479
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But it is a matter of medicine.

480
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So he can't be out of suspicion.

481
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It makes sense.

482
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You should be responsible for this.

483
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

484
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I understand.

485
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,280
I am already under His Majesty's control.

486
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,280
I will go back and protect him.

487
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I will leave now.

488
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Please.

490
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Father.

491
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
You are welcome.

492
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
I can't afford it.

493
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Father,

494
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
I know

495
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
you are blaming me for what happened.

496
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
I didn't listen to you.

497
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
But I have no choice.

498
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
Xu Jing, the old fox,

499
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
was watching over me.

500
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
He even used Zhou Xianyi's case

501
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
to accuse me in front of His Majesty.

502
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
If it wasn't for you,

503
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I would have been out of the position.

504
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
You are too stubborn.

505
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
You can't listen to me.

506
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
You should behave yourself.

507
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Father.

508
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
I will not let you go

509
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
if Jinxia is in danger.

510
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Is it because Jinxia saved me?

511
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Yes.

512
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
I can't imagine

513
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
what we can do

514
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
except Jinxia.

515
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Jinxia is the only one

516
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
who can fight against me.

517
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
It's none of your business.

518
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
I am not afraid of Jinxia.

519
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
I will not let you go.

520
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I will not let you go.

521
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
I will not let you go.

522
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
It's none of your business.

523
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Don't play tricks on me

524
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
because Jinxia can't get out of bed.

525
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Be careful that I will

526
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
beat you to death.

527
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Don't blame me.

528
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Okay.

529
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
I will beat you now.

530
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Don't think I don't know

531
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
what you are thinking.

532
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
If I beat you now,

533
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
you can't stand it.

534
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I am not a tiger.

535
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Jinxia saved your life.

536
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I don't want her to suffer.

537
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
I don't know

538
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
how much Jinxia owes you.

539
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
But

540
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
she has lost half of her life for you.

541
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
It's enough.

542
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
I have made up my mind.

543
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
I will take her away

544
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
when she is recovered.

545
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
You can't protect her.

546
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
I will do it.

547
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Jinxia

548
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Are you sure that

549
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
the poison in Lu Yi's body

550
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
has been removed?

551
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
I have confirmed it again.

552
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
And

553
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
the old man we are looking for

554
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
is also with Lu Yi.

555
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
It seems that

556
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
he is very familiar

557
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
with the woman in the Wind Forest.

558
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,560
The old man is from the Medicine King Valley.

559
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
But he can only cure the poison

560
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
if he can cure the poison.

561
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
And no one in the group

562
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
is good at medicine.

563
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,560
If Lu Yi's poison

564
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
is really removed,

565
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
it seems that

566
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
the woman in the Wind Forest

567
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
is really not simple.

568
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
What do you want to do?

569
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
If this woman

570
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
can really cure the poison,

571
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
it is very important

572
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
to us.

573
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Lu Yi, Lu Yi.

574
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
You are really lucky.

575
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Be careful.

576
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Yuan Daxia.

577
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
I have arranged the location for you.

578
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Just sit on my side.

579
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
It is convenient for me to take care of you.

580
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
No need.

581
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Jinxia, sit next to me.

582
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I can take care of you.

583
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
I don't need to bother you.

584
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
What did I say?

585
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
You don't understand what I said.

586
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
You just got up from the sick bed.

587
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
You still need to take care of others.

588
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
It is great if you don't bother others.

589
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
I will sit there.

590
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
You...

591
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Enough.

592
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
I haven't finished talking to you.

593
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Can you let me eat quietly?

594
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
It is noisy every day.

595
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
I can't stop eating.

596
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
After eating this meal,

597
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
you should leave here quickly.

598
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Then, Senior Sister...

599
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Miss Shangguan.

600
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Ruan Bings?

601
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Why do you want to do this?

602
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
It is troublesome to do.

603
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
This is troublesome.

604
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
But I think

605
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
if I can eat

606
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
food with the taste of hometown,

607
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
it will be touching.

608
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Taste of hometown?

609
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
What do you mean?

610
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Miss Shangguan, do you think

611
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Dr. Lin is a person?

612
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
I observe

613
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,560
that he is from Fujian.

614
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
I have noticed that

615
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
the tea he drinks

616
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
is all from Anxi.

617
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
I was thinking

618
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
if it wasn't for the hometown,

619
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
why would he

620
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
take so much?

621
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I didn't expect that

622
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
you are very thoughtful.

623
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
You have found out

624
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
such a small detail.

625
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
No...

626
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
No.

627
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Miss Shangguan,

628
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
how about you

629
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
taste this Ruan Bings first?

630
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Let's eat together.

631
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Okay.

632
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
The dishes are ready.

633
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Let's serve the dishes.

634
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Okay.

635
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Come on.

636
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
The dishes are ready.

637
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Everyone,

638
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
today I have

639
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
shown my skills

640
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
of keeping a house.

641
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
You all taste it.

642
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
See how it is.

643
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
It smells so good.

644
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Uncle.

645
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
You forgot your cover book.

646
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Look at you.

647
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
You are really...

648
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
No.

649
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
I am just doing your job.

650
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
You made it yourself?

651
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Yes.

652
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Good.

653
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Your wounds

654
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
are almost healed.

655
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
I will

656
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
serve you this meal.

657
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Aunt Lin,

658
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
you can come to the capital to find me.

659
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
The scenery in the capital is very beautiful.

660
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
The red leaves of Xiangshan are very beautiful.

661
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
I will take you there.

662
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
I want to go, too.

663
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
You are not fully recovered yet.

664
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
You only know to hang out.

665
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Don't only know to play.

666
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
How can you make this Ruan Bings?

667
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
My father likes to eat.

668
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
He often cooks at home.

669
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
If Aunt Lin likes to eat

670
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
the dishes cooked by Dayang,

671
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
she can cook for a few more days.

672
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
I will cook it for you every day.

673
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
I promise I won't do the same every day.

674
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Your father is from Fujian?

675
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Not really.

676
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I just ate it in the early years.

677
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
I just ate it in the early years.

678
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
I have been used to the taste since then.

679
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,560
I haven't eaten this for many years.

680
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
I didn't expect

681
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
to eat it here.

682
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
You work in Liushan Sect.

683
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Who is your father?

684
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
My father is the head of Liushan Sect.

685
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Yang Chengwan.

686
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Aunt Lin, have you heard of my master?

687
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
No, I haven't.

688
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
It reminds me of an old friend.

689
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
May I ask

690
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
which two characters are Chengwan?

691
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Chengwan in Pengcheng Wanli.

692
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Different characters with different sounds.

693
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I made a mistake.

694
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Let's eat.

695
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Or the dishes will get cold.

696
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Let's eat.

697
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Eat, eat, eat.

698
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
Come on, eat more.

699
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Eat.

700
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Here.

701
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Thank you, sir.

702
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I didn't expect that the Imperial Guards are so good at serving people.

703
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
It seems that you often serve people.

704
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Today, the coriander balls are well-done.

705
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
You can taste

706
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
the taste of your mouth.

707
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Lu Yi, don't push me too hard.

708
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
I think you have recovered almost.

709
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
If you have the ability, fight with me.

710
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
The loser bowed his head and made a mistake.

711
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Young Master Xie is so kind.

712
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
I am just a poor god.

713
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
I dare to admit defeat.

714
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
I am just a poor god.

715
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I dare to admit defeat.

716
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
I dare to admit defeat.

717
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
You...

718
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
A man's breath is like a incense.

719
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
A man as generous as you is rare.

720
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
If you change to another man,

721
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
I am afraid that you will accept this challenge for your face.

722
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Face is something like this.

723
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
It's useless to be scared by yourself.

724
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
In your heart,

725
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
what is the most important thing?

726
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
The more you like it,

727
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
the more you like it.

728
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
I...

729
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
I want to be happy.

730
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Go.

731
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Go.

732
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Master, please hold on for a while.

733
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
As long as I can find the medical immortal,

734
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
you will be saved.

735
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
I am afraid that you will catch cold

736
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
and get sick.

737
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
If you really want to die,

738
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
I will let you live.

739
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
A deal is a deal.

740
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,840
I'm willing to do it.

741
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,240
Love.

742
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,440
Love is also love.

743
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,480
It's a pity that

744
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,160
if there's love, there's also love.

745
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,440
Why are you still chatting with her?

746
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,080
Enough, Xie Yueyue.

747
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,040
Stop talking.

748
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,960
Let's eat.

749
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm starving.

750
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,400
You're also talking for her.

751
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm not sure.

752
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,640
How can I fall in love with you?

753
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,320
Seriously.

754
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,680
I'm full.

755
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,320
Shangguan.

756
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,240
Senior.

757
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,560
Let's eat first.

758
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,800
I'll go and have a look.

759
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,760
This...

760
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Why are you full without eating?

761
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,560
I didn't expect

762
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,320
that in this world,

763
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,560
there would be such a helpless person.

764
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
Dr. Lin.

765
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,760
What do you mean by that?

766
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,280
Nothing.

767
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,200
Come on.

768
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,040
Let's eat.

769
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,800
Eat more.

770
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,320
Why can't you marry me?

771
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,320
I know that Senior

772
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,600
doesn't like me,

773
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
this little brat.

774
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,440
It must be my father.

775
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,520
I'm not a child.

776
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,800
It must be my father who forced me.

777
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,680
You're filial.

778
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,400
That's why you agreed to this marriage.

779
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,880
But I can't hurt Senior forever.

780
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,480
I want to protect Yuan Jinxia for the rest of my life.

781
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm done.

782
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,160
If I don't do it now,

783
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,600
Dr. Lin's Feng Lin

784
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,960
will be cut off by you.

785
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,760
Just watch me laugh.

786
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,000
What's so funny?

787
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,160
You just said

788
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,480
if the sky is full of love,

789
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,320
the sky is cold.

790
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,000
We're all ordinary people.

791
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,520
We can avoid it.

792
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,000
But if you don't want to be a woman,

793
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
you can't be a woman.

794
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,400
You can't be a woman.

795
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,520
You can't be a woman.

796
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,560
You can't be a woman.

797
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,600
You can't be a woman.

798
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,680
You can't be a woman.

799
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,240
Of course, we can't avoid it.

800
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,120
There's nothing to laugh about.

801
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,480
I entered Wu An Gang when I was very young.

802
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,520
Uncle Xie treated me very well.

803
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,440
So I knew since I was little.

804
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,040
Although my surname is not Xie,

805
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,560
I'm always a member of the Xie family.

806
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
Xie Xiao Tian likes freedom.

807
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,720
He doesn't want to take over Wu An Gang.

808
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,320
So I took this responsibility for him.

809
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
In my heart,

810
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,680
I've already regarded him as my husband.

811
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,800
You don't want to tell him?

812
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,720
So what if I tell him?

813
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,880
I'm just humiliating myself.

814
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,720
In the past,

815
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,200
I've only been in love with him

816
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,200
for a short time.

817
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,280
If so,

818
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,640
why bother him for so many days?

819
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,560
I'm fine.

820
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,760
Okay.

821
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,000
Let's go.

822
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,760
Are you really fine?

823
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,280
Why are you so harsh on yourself?

824
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Why can't you be like an ordinary woman?

825
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,600
You're not happy anymore?

826
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
You're playing with your temper.

827
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
You're playing with your attitude.

828
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,720
Waiting for someone to coax you.

829
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,520
You're not happy anymore?

830
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
You're not happy anymore?

831
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
You're not happy anymore?

832
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
You're not happy anymore?

833
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
You're not happy anymore?

834
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
You're not happy anymore?

835
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,360
You're thinking about him now.

836
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,840
He will only never see you.

837
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,000
I thought

838
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,720
you were a strong person.

839
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
But now,

840
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,160
I'm just a coward.

841
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,640
You think I'm angry

842
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,400
because I don't want to be angry?

843
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
I can say whatever I want.

844
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,120
I don't care about other people's feelings.

845
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,480
I want to be like that,

846
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,560
but I can't.

847
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,080
You chose that man

848
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,280
so many times because of his friend honor.

849
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,600
Stop talking nonsense.

850
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,000
He asked me to come.

851
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:32,480
I'm是

852
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,480
Tell me.

853
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,600
Have you found anything good?

854
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,040
No.

855
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,440
Only those who grow up in family hatred can have this confidence.

856
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,120
And I...

857
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,960
will never be able to.

858
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
I...

859
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
I'm sorry.

860
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,960
I just said it right.

861
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Do you want to kill me now?

862
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,960
It seems that every time you're sad,

863
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,960
you'll be able to see me.

864
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
I'm sorry.

865
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
I'm sorry.

866
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
I'm sorry.

867
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
I'm sorry.

868
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,960
It seems that every time you're sad,

869
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,960
you'll be able to see me.

870
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
If it were me,

871
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,960
I'm afraid I'd also want to kill that guy.

872
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
You're smiling.

873
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,960
If you're smiling, it means you're fine.

874
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
Actually, in my heart,

875
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,960
you're much better than you think.

876
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,960
Don't underestimate yourself too much.

877
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm lost in the corner of your eyes.

878
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,960
The wind is howling, my heart is fluttering.

879
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,960
My heart is blank.

880
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,960
A thousand miles of ambush is coming.

881
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,960
Who is outside of the mountain?

882
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I can't beat the dark sea of fate.

883
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,960
When I close my eyes, I can see your face.

884
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,960
When I open my eyes, I can see your face.

885
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,960
Who is fighting against the wind in the mortal world?

886
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,960
No sound, the dark clouds rise.

887
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,960
The fate turns.

888
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
Seeing through the changes in the world,

889
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,960
I want to say goodbye.

890
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,960
But it's too sad to say goodbye.

891
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,960
I miss you.

892
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,960
I miss you so much.

893
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,960
The day I met you,

894
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I had my hair cut.

895
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,960
We spent our years together.

896
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,960
In the dream, we talked for a thousand years.
