00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm afraid

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm afraid

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm afraid

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm afraid

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The star of the star is still guarding the star of the star

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Therefore, the channel specifies that the star of the star is not God's will

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's very likely to be a human

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm too tired

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I know

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I know

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Xiao Yang Yang

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I finally found my only family

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But I can't protect him

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yuan Daxia

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are not like the Yuan Daxia I knew before

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What can I do if I'm not afraid?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I used to think

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A little bit of broken silver

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Live a little life

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm not afraid of the sky falling

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But now the sky is really going to fall

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm afraid of the sky

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Dare not pay

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Such a big person

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How can I not even protect my family?

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm so useless

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why are you useless

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why are you useless

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The power of the Yan family is too strong

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't cry

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know what to do now

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have no way

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't want to sit like this

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't want to do anything

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't you still have me?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What's the matter

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's discuss together

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's find a way together

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Although I have no power in the capital

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But my kung fu is not bad

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What dangerous things in the future

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let me do it for you

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you, Xie Yuan Yuan

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But it's my own business

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want to drag you down

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Unless you don't take me as your brother

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Since we are the best brothers

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We should take it together

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yuan Daxia

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
For you

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I go up the mountain and down the sea

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Two kinds of knives are not enough

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't refuse me

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
it is good

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Even if you want to refuse me

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will do it

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't cry

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's okay

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How old are you

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Still crying

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We are going to forget all the worries today

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Things will be solved, right?

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's put fireworks

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Forget all the worries

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you, Xie Yuan Yuan

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you thank us again, we will be far away

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't thank

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yuan Daxia

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I am here

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Forget all the worries

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Good

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Your Majesty

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You look so good

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It seems that the pill of Miss Lan is really useful

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's really good for you

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think I am in good health

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
These days I am not tired

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Maybe I can live for a hundred years

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Your Majesty, you are really funny

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You are the emperor

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Of course you are

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now there is more Miss Lan

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Your Majesty

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are really good

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are so smart

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If I live for a hundred years

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Someone will not agree

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Call Miss Lan

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your Majesty, you forget

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Miss Lan is still in the Jin family

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I just said you are smart

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are confused again

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Of course it's a solution

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I am confused

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I am confused

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Go now

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Go

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Congratulations, Miss Lan

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Miss Lan

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Your Majesty

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The pill you took is good for your mood

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I said a lot of good words to you in front of the emperor

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The emperor asked me to pass the decree

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
To leave Jin family and go to the army

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thank you, Mr. Li

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I will rely on you

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
To say a few words in front of the emperor

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I will pack up now

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I will go with you

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Wait

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Miss Lan

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The pill is a good thing

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a good thing

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Miss Lan

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You forget about me so soon

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Mr. Li

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Although the pill is good

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can't eat too much

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I understand

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Understand

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ok

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Uncle, why are you here?

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I have been here for several days

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I haven't found any clues

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Uncle, don't be so careless

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go back

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you are found

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The consequences will be unimaginable

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I am the only one

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can do it alone

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Go

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't be at ease if you are alone

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Besides, in this world

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have nothing to worry about except Ling'er

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Uncle

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
A horse cart

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you doing?

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yesterday I went into the Yan Mansion

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I found my aunt's head oil

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
On the wheel of this horse cart

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
In the backyard

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How do you know it's her head oil?

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
My aunt's head oil is made by herself

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The fragrance is different from others

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You can smell it

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's follow the horse cart

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
See what clues there are

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Go

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sir Lu, please wait a moment

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Master will come soon

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Please

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is this the coffin you usually wear?

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, sir

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He will wear it tomorrow

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I will send it to him after washing

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I am so sorry

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Sir Xu

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I made you wait for a long time

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please sit down

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can leave

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is it a good news that

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Lu Qianshi suddenly came to visit?

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You are really good at predicting things

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I found that

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There are some problems with these accounts

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I just want to show them to you

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is the account of the Yan's transport department

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's strange

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The tax and the entry into the account are not good

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's very different from what Yan Shao Qiong

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
has paid recently

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Lu Qianshi

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Where did you get this account book?

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I sent people to

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
bury it between two columns

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
for half a year

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If the emperor knows about this account book

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The loss will be so big

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Even if Yan Shao Qiong

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
uses the Yan family as a support

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm afraid that we can't protect him

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is a good opportunity

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The emperor will think about it more

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We just need to report it to the emperor

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The rest will be left to the emperor

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yan Shi Fan

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
will not expect that

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
we will start from Yan Shao Qiong

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I hope this will work

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
By the way, sir

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Sir

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I just came in

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I found that you have made a supplement

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
in the government's mansion

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You are really thoughtful

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
At my age

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You will understand

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Sometimes

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No matter how many words

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
These things are not persuasive

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I manage the whole Ministry of Rites

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's not better than the Ministry of Revenue and Ministry of Works

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There is a lot of water

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
A water dam

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A hidden water supply

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't need to say

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The emperor will have a decision

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yan Shi Fan

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Sir

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Uncle

233
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think I am inside

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you sure?

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm not sure

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But I have a feeling that I am here

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Wait for me here

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I will go in

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Wait

240
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can't go in now

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why?

242
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I just have a feeling

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm not sure

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And it's day time

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yan Shi Fan just went in

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If we break in

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We will be dead

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Girl

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't trust you

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Wait for me here

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I will go by myself

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Uncle, what are you talking about?

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We should go together

254
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But not now

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
At night

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
When it's dark

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We should go in together

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's easier to see

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay?

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Bear with it

261
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I didn't expect the emperor would

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Dispute your ban

263
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I didn't expect it either

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have to serve the emperor

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I have to think about it

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How about it?

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I will tell my brother

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And ask you out as soon as I break in

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's good, right?

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We should see each other less

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It should be Yan Shi Fan

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Who did it

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
At the time of Bai Lu

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He has started to target you

277
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I think so

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He had many people

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
To persuade me

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
To surrender Yan family

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I rejected them

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He tried to frame me

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's not strange

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The situation in the palace has changed

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You should be more careful

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't worry

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I will act accordingly

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You haven't seen me for days

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You don't look better

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Still worried about the emperor?

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No love is like many sufferings

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
One inch is worth thousands of miles

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There are many people in the world

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No love is like many thoughts

295
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You should feel the pain

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I can feel it

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't want to see the end

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Break

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Go on

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you don't want him to be sad

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You should come back

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I am looking for him

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Go

304
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Be careful

305
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I am afraid there is a trap inside

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't make any noise

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We just want to ask you something

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Have you seen a woman

309
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Over thirty years old

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's me

311
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You should be honest

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We won't hurt you

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Where is she

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Take us there

315
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hurry up

316
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Hurry up

317
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's you

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Grandpa

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Ming

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Brother

321
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why are you here

322
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's too dangerous

323
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You should go

324
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't save me

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Leave me alone

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I won't come to save you

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What if you are in danger

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Enough

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's go out

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Go

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Go

332
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Hurry up

333
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It smells so bad

334
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a star

335
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
We are ambushed

336
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Grandpa

337
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Little girl

338
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Long time no see

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Long time no see

340
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yan Shi Fan

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Don't touch my aunt

342
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Aunt

343
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What a friendly name

344
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Your mother is Lin He

345
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What Lin He

346
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't know what you are talking about

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You are a constable

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You should interrogate the prisoner

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I will teach you today

350
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If you don't know

351
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You should answer me

352
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Who is Lin He

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Not deny it

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't be self-righteous

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You don't know

356
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You don't admit it

357
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It doesn't matter

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I have a way to make you admit it

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yan Shi Fan

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What do you want to do

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What do you want to do

362
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I will give you three numbers

363
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If you don't admit it

364
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will kill you

365
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yan Shi Fan, you bastard

366
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Kill me

367
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Kill me

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Senior

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Ok, I will satisfy you

370
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I say

371
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Lin He

372
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's my mother

373
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't hurt them

374
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Jinxia

375
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Girl

376
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Take the little girl away

377
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Where are you taking her

379
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yan Shi Fan

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Where are you taking her

381
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Let go of her

382
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Let go of her

383
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Let go of her

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let go of her

385
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let go of her

386
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Let go of Jinxia and the girl

387
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Let go of her

388
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I will let go of her

389
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yan Shi Fan, stop

390
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You bastard

391
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Senior

392
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I know

393
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You have a love for my daughter

394
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But you have to see if you have the ability to save her

395
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yan Shi Fan

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You can call me

397
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can call me

398
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You let them go first

399
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Kill me

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do as you want

401
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You let them die

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You let them die

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Lin Er

404
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yan Shi Fan, I beg you

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I beg you

406
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Lin Er, listen to me

407
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Listen to me

408
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I just want you to stay with me

409
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
As long as you agree

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I will let her go

411
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do as you want

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Why can't I let go of my grandson

413
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Why

414
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Senior

415
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Stop fighting

416
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I beg you to stop fighting

417
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let her go

418
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Because I like you

419
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Promise me, okay

420
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I beg you

421
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Stop fighting

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Stop fighting

423
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I promise you

424
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I promise you, okay

425
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Really

426
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I promise you

427
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Senior

428
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Senior

429
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Don't

430
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry

431
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Lin Er

432
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry

433
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry, Senior

434
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,760
Senior Brother.

435
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
Senior Brother!

436
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,800
Chen Lu Yi.

437
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

438
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,360
Get up.

439
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

440
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,040
Have you found out

441
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,840
what I asked the Imperial Guards to investigate?

442
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:58,920
Yes.

443
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,520
I've found out everything.

444
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The Imperial Guards

445
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,320
have been

446
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
attacking me.

447
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
Do they even care about me?

448
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,040
They think they have a lot of money.

449
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,520
They even want to take back the money.

450
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Your Majesty, please calm down.

451
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,920
Please take care of yourself.

452
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,680
Isn't Yan Shao Qiong a private servant?

453
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,080
Why did he interfere in the repair?

454
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,280
This time, Yan Ge Lang

455
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,720
repaired the wood.

456
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,440
He asked him to do it.

457
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,720
Yan...

458
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,440
Yan Ge Lang?

459
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,960
You may leave.

460
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,840
Yes.

461
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,280
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

462
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,160
Tell me.

463
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,880
Tell me.

464
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,400
Tell me.

465
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
Tell me.

466
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,960
Tell me.

467
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,160
Girl.

468
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,960
Why did they hit you like this?

469
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,360
Are you okay?

470
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,160
I'm fine.

471
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm fine.

472
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,640
Where's my aunt?

473
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,520
She's not here.

474
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,320
She's not here.

475
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,040
She's not here.

476
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,680
She's not here.

477
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,400
She's not here.

478
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,080
She's not here.

479
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,880
She's not here.

480
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,720
Where's my aunt?

481
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,240
Damn Yan Shi Fan.

482
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Damn it.

483
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,480
Girl.

484
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,640
Don't worry.

485
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,920
If your master finds out that we didn't go back,

486
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,560
he'll definitely think of us.

487
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,200
Yes.

488
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
But my master is influenced by the law of the palace.

489
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,000
If he knows it,

490
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
he won't let anyone in without permission.

491
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,720
Should he go to find Lu Yi?

492
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,480
Why don't you come to me?

493
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,280
I'm a daughter of a sinner.

494
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,960
It's too late for you to come.

495
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,600
Will you help me?

496
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,560
Or you should stay away from me

497
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,160
to avoid dragging you down.

498
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,720
If you don't have other orders,

499
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,200
I'll leave now.

500
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,640
Now we can only think of a way.

501
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,520
Girl.

502
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,480
Listen to me.

503
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
If someone comes in,

504
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,280
we'll act according to the situation.

505
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,160
I'll cover you.

506
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,000
You should escape.

507
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,440
What are you talking about?

508
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,480
We should go together.

509
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
I'm injured.

510
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,880
I can't run.

511
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,280
Uncle.

512
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,520
We should go together even if we're injured.

513
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,400
Alright.

514
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,240
You're injured.

515
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,240
You should rest.

516
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,440
Don't talk.

517
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,840
Uncle.

518
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,600
Long live to Your Majesty!

519
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,920
Stearn yourself up.

520
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,960
Thanks, Your Majesty.

521
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,160
Achieve your dream.

522
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,040
Yes.

523
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Let's start.

524
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Yes.

525
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,040
The expenses of each province have been reported.

526
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
When is the cabinet going to check

527
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
what should be done and what shouldn't be done?

528
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,040
What problems did they encounter during the process of calculating?

529
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
The cabinet needs to give an explanation.

530
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Yan Ge Lao, let's start from you.

531
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,040
The blessing of God and His Majesty

532
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,040
have been verified by the cabinet's Ministry of Revenue,

533
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Ministry of Works, Ministry of Rites and Ministry of Personnel.

534
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,040
In addition to the disaster relief and repair of the palace,

535
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,040
some of the other departments have been over-reported.

536
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,040
The balance of the government is within 300 liang.

537
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,040
The Ministry of Works is a little bigger.

538
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,040
There are still some projects for the Wei Palace.

539
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,040
The cabinet doesn't dare to approve these.

540
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Please give your order, Your Majesty.

541
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Let's put the Ministry of Works aside first.

542
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Minister Xu,

543
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,040
tell me about the other departments.

544
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,040
The Ministry of Works has been over-reported.

545
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Tell me about the other departments.

546
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Your Majesty,

547
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
I have two accounts to submit.

548
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I don't know what is true and what is false.

549
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Please read them out.

550
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Two accounts?

551
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Submit them.

552
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Yes.

553
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,040
These are all the Ministry of Works' accounts.

554
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Two accounts.

555
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,040
The total is 3000 liang.

556
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Minister Xu,

557
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,040
where did you get these accounts?

558
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Your Majesty,

559
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
the Ministry of Works has been over-reported this year.

560
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,040
I have collected the local accounts and sent them to the Yi Yi He Team.

561
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,040
I found that the accounts of the Ministry of Works

562
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
were sent to the royal government office.

563
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,040
There are a total of 500 accounts.

564
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
The accounts of the royal government office

565
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
are 1.2 million.

566
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,040
But the local accounts

567
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
are 243 million.

568
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Not only that,

569
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
the accounts of the Jin Duan, Si Chou,

570
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Juan, Xia Bu, and Dong Bu

571
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
are all out of balance.

572
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Especially the Yan Yun, which is in a big deficit.

573
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Yan Shao Qiong.

574
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

575
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Yan Yun Si.

576
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Explain it to me.

577
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Your Majesty,

578
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I have been in charge of Yan Yun since I took over Yan Yun.

579
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,040
I have been responsible for the state treasury.

580
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
But this year,

581
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
the pirates are moving in Liangzhe.

582
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
This is also known to everyone.

583
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
The official ships of the Yan Yun,

584
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
several of them were intercepted by the pirates.

585
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
So,

586
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,040
the silver is much less.

587
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

588
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Not only Liangzhe and Fujian have been in trouble,

589
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
but there have been several floodings recently.

590
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
The people are in a bad shape.

591
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
The court has paid a lot of money

592
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
to help the disaster relief.

593
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
So the income of the Ministry of Revenue

594
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
is getting less and less.

595
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Your Excellency,

596
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,040
don't blame the disaster relief.

597
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Haven't we ever won a battle?

598
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
The money of the pirates

599
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
has been recorded in the account.

600
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Your Majesty,

601
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
I have handed over the accounts of Yan Yun

602
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
to the cabinet of ministers.

603
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
The calculation was not correct.

604
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Now there is a fake account book.

605
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
This is clearly a trap.

606
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Lord Xu,

607
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
we are in the cabinet together.

608
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Why didn't you mention it when you were calculating?

609
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Why did you make such a decision now?

610
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Don't be too excited, Lord Yan.

611
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
You are not clear.

612
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
You don't make sense.

613
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Although the account book of Yan Yun

614
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
has been modified,

615
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
it is still not very big.

616
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
But the accounts of the two areas

617
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
can be found in the Yanghuai area.

618
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
The people are willing to live again.

619
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
They are everywhere.

620
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,040
This year, the disaster of the two areas

621
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
was carried out by the pirates.

622
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
It is not fake.

623
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
But if you have won the battle,

624
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
the things of the pirates are also real.

625
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
The disaster of the two areas

626
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
is not reported to reduce the tax.

627
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Instead, it is added.

628
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
This makes the people homeless.

629
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
And the accounts of your Ministry of Revenue

630
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,040
are recorded as 50% of the tax.

631
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Lord Yan,

632
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
the remaining 50%

633
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
is in your pocket

634
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
or the pocket of the Ministry of Revenue?

635
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
You...

636
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
You are talking nonsense.

637
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
I have been serving the court all my life.

638
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
How can I be loyal to the government?

639
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Your Majesty,

640
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
I have always been diligent and strict.

641
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I dare not say anything.

642
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Now, Lord Xu has a fake account book

643
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
that I don't know where it came from.

644
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
I am trying to hide it from you.

645
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Please give me a clear view.

646
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
I remember that Yan Shaoqiong

647
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
was recommended by Lord Yan.

648
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Lord Yan,

649
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
do you have anything to say?

650
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
Yes.

651
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,040
When Yan Shaoqiong

652
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,040
was in charge of the administration of the four areas,

653
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
I did recommend him.

654
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,040
When he was still the imperial censor of the Left City,

655
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I thought he was a

656
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,040
talented man who could govern the country.

657
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,040
But I don't know

658
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,040
about these two accounts.

659
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Come.

660
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Yes.

661
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Take Yan Shaoqiong

662
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
to the imperial prison

663
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
and wait for his punishment.

664
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Yes.

665
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Your Majesty, please give me a clear view.

666
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
I am sorry for my rudeness.

667
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Yes.

668
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Your Majesty, please give me a clear view.

669
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Your Majesty, please give me a clear view.

670
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Your Majesty.

671
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Lord Yan,

672
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,040
I am here to give you two options.

673
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
You can get three years' salary.

674
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

675
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Xu Jing, the old fox,

676
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
he is so stupid.

677
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,040
How could he have Yan Yun's account book?

678
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Sometimes, he is not good at doing things.

679
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
In this kind of thing,

680
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,040
except for the Imperial Guards, who else can it be?

681
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Lu Yi?

682
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
I underestimated Lu Ting's son.

683
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
You think this is a joke?

684
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

685
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Bring them over here.

686
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

687
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Lord Yan,

688
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
how did it go?

689
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,040
I didn't steal anything.

690
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
I have nothing to say.

691
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
But you're greedy.

692
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
I heard that all the salt merchants

693
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,920
in the two states

694
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,600
want to get the salt.

695
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,640
They need to give you a huge amount of money.

696
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,920
But you're so stingy

697
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,560
that they want to take your money.

698
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,880
You're so close to some salt merchants.

699
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,160
You make them do whatever they want.

700
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,000
For example, the dead horse Chang'an in Hangzhou.

701
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,360
What dead horse Chang'an?

702
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,880
Don't talk nonsense.

703
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,360
Hell

704
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:11,240
We're just a

705
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,120
I want to be like Uncle Han.

706
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,280
Sir Lu, I advise you not to waste your time.

707
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,240
You should leave a way for yourself.

708
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,200
So that you won't be in trouble in the end.

709
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,440
You're so loyal.

710
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,720
Si Feng, bring the porridge here.

711
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,680
Yes.

712
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:41,980
capture

713
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,720
Let me see if someone recognizes this.

714
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,480
Parrots.

715
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,320
Do you want to kill me?

716
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,840
You haven't said anything yet.

717
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,880
But I'm willing to kill you.

718
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,840
It's been found on the mountain in which General Yu

719
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,520
came back from Maohai Peak.

720
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,240
I was curious and asked General Yu for it.

721
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,640
I didn't expect that he would make such an important work.

722
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,040
Lord Yan.

723
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,040
Look at this Tanhuang.

724
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,640
It's exactly the same as what Sima Chang'an made.

725
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,240
There are countless things in this world that are the same.

726
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,040
How can you prove that this thing came out from the same place?

727
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,040
Lord Yan, you don't understand.

728
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,440
The iron ore that Sima Chang'an dug is different from ordinary iron ore.

729
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,640
You can see what's in it at a glance.

730
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,440
If you don't believe me,

731
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,040
I can ask a blacksmith to come and see it.

732
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,440
Sima Chang'an dug the iron ore privately and made a fire-trap.

733
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,840
He used salt to make a trap.

734
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,840
Although the matter was exposed,

735
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,440
he took the initiative to turn himself in.

736
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,840
But you and I know that

737
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,040
the real Sima Chang'an is someone else.

738
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,640
I just take money from people and make it convenient for them.

739
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,240
If you sue me, you can sue me for bribery.

740
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,640
I've never seen Sima Chang'an anyway.

741
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Never seen?

742
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,240
If I report this to His Majesty,

743
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,640
and let him know that you two are in the same plan,

744
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,640
what do you think will happen?

745
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,240
Lu Yi, what are you going to do?

746
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Tell me who is behind you.

747
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,840
The crime of the private pirates will not fall on you.

748
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,440
Father,

749
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,840
Madam Yuan came to find Jinxia just now.

750
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
She said she didn't come back for a night.

751
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
I've already comforted her.

752
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Didn't come back for a night?

753
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,240
Yes.

754
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,040
Father,

755
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,040
Jinxia and Uncle Gai disappeared at the same time.

756
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Could it be that they sneaked into Yan's mansion to save Aunt Lin?

757
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,440
Father, I have a bad feeling.

758
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,040
Oh, no.

759
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,240
Xia told me yesterday that

760
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,640
she was pregnant with Ling'er.

761
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
She was not locked in Yan's mansion,

762
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,240
but in Yan's house.

763
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,640
She asked me to send someone to investigate, but I didn't agree.

764
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,240
Now it seems that they secretly went to investigate.

765
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,040
But, but they disappeared for a night.

766
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,840
Father,

767
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,240
could they have encountered some danger?

768
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,040
If Xia'er was really locked up by Yan Shi Fan,

769
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,840
she can't save us with our strength.

770
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,040
How about this?

771
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
You go to find Lord Lu,

772
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,040
see if he has any possible way.

773
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,240
Father,

774
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Jinxia is separated from Lord Lu now.

775
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,640
Is he willing to help?

776
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,040
Let's go to find him first.

777
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,440
If he doesn't help,

778
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,040
we'll think of other ways.

779
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,240
Okay.

780
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,040
Uncle Yang.

781
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,840
Uncle Yang.

782
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,440
Xi'er.

783
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,640
Xia'er.

784
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,240
Uncle Yang.

785
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,040
You're here.

786
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,840
Yang Yue,

787
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,040
you just said who you want to help.

788
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,040
What do you want to help?

789
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,840
Now Jinxia and Uncle Gai are all missing.

790
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,240
We suspect that they sneaked into Yan's mansion to save Lin Yi.

791
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,640
So we're trying to find a way.

792
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
It's too rash.

793
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,640
Yang Yue,

794
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,040
tell me where the mansion is.

795
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,040
I'm going to save Jinxia.

796
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,640
Wait.

797
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,840
Yan's mansion is not a place to sleep.

798
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,440
How about this?

799
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,440
Let's go to find Lord Lu first.

800
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:55,840
Father.

801
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,040
How's Yan Shaoqiong's case?

802
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,040
Father,

803
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,240
I want to investigate Yan's case for a few more days.

804
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,040
Why?

805
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,840
I haven't found any solid evidence

806
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,840
about Yan's case.

807
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,840
Yan Shaoqiong is the most trusted person of Yan's.

808
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,640
It's related to the case of Sima Chang'an.

809
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
I want to start from him.

810
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Although Yan Shaoqiong is greedy and honest,

811
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,440
he's from Jin's family.

812
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,040
He has a few literary skills.

813
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
Moreover,

814
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,440
his wealth and glory came from the Yan family.

815
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,040
So it's not easy to ask him to tell the truth.

816
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,440
If we miss Yan Shaoqiong's breakthrough,

817
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,840
it'll be even more difficult

818
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
to catch Yan Shifan.

819
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,040
No.

820
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,640
Father, are you all right?

821
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,440
No.

822
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
His Majesty knows

823
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,240
your competition with Yan's.

824
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,440
His Majesty is suspicious.

825
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,640
If we use a special method to make him confess,

826
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,440
it'll be a great loss.

827
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,840
It's better to wait and see.

828
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,640
I know

829
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,640
I won't act rashly.

830
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,440
Father, it's getting cold.

831
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
You're not well.

832
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,240
I'll handle this kind of trivial matter.

833
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,040
All right.

834
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,240
Lord Lu.

835
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,440
Lord Lu.

836
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Miss Shangguan.

837
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,440
When did you come to the capital?

838
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,840
A few days ago.

839
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,840
Xi, don't be so nervous.

840
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,240
I'll tell Lord Lu the reason why I came here.

841
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,040
What's wrong?

842
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
Jin Xia is missing.

843
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
When?

844
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
Last night.

845
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,840
Did she go to save Doctor Lin?

846
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,040
Yes.

847
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,840
Yesterday, she found Yan Shifan

848
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,440
hiding the spirit.

849
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,240
Then she asked me

850
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,440
to search Yan's mansion in the name of the Six Forts.

851
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Father refused her.

852
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,040
I guess she's

853
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,440
trapped inside with Uncle Gai.

854
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
She even followed Yan Shifan's mansion.

855
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,240
She's too bold.

856
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,040
Lord Yan.

857
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,440
What's the matter

858
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,240
that Lord Lu came here?

859
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,440
Did Yuan Bu Kui come to Lord Yan

860
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,840
to find Doctor Lin?

861
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,840
No.

862
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Lord Lu

863
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,040
asked Yuan Bu Kui

864
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,040
for some reason.

865
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
What happened to him?

866
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,240
I heard that a few days ago,

867
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,640
he was in the capital.

868
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,040
He was in the capital.

869
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,240
I heard that a few days ago,

870
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
Lord Yan caught Doctor Lin again.

871
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,440
You're the Imperial Guards.

872
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,640
It's a rule

873
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,240
to catch a suspect and ask for evidence.

874
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,040
The rain falls, I'm lost.

875
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,040
My mind is messed up.

876
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,640
The wind blows, I'm shocked.

877
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,640
My heart is empty.

878
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,040
Thousands of miles of ambush come and go.

879
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Who is out of the city

880
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,040
can't compare to fate.

881
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,640
Close your eyes, I can see your face.

882
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,640
Open your eyes, the back is full of gold.

883
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,640
The sword is full of sweet.

884
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,640
Who is out of the city

885
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:12,040
can't hear the sound of the sword.

886
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,040
The wind blows, I'm shocked.

887
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,440
I can see your face.

888
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,640
I want to say goodbye.

889
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,240
But it's too sad.

890
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,040
The back is full of gold.

891
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,440
The sword is full of sweet.

892
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,840
I want to say goodbye.

893
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,840
But it's too sad.

894
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,040
The wind blows, I'm shocked.

895
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,640
I can see your face.

896
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,640
Open your eyes, I can see your face.

897
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,640
The wind blows, I'm shocked.

898
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I want to say goodbye.

899
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,040
But it's too sad.

900
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,040
The sword is full of sweet.

901
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,640
The sword is full of sweet.

902
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,240
The wind blows, I'm shocked.

903
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,840
I want to say goodbye.
