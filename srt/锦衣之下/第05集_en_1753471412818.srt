Let's take a look at the ghost ship

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
Ghost ship

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,540
I'm going, too

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,040
Afraid?

62
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,960
Miserable people who collude with Leng Ning

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
He is still a pronoun of Leng Ning

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,080
You

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,040
We'll survive in the wild

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,920
Sir, you can fly and run

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
Can you do it?

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
discount

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
so much blood

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
How many people are dead?

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
You

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,820
Drop still.

73
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,480
Yeah.

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
I will tell you the truth.

75
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,140
This is not blood.

76
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,060
It's sedative.

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Only then do you know that it's sedative.

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,820
It's threadpping powder.

79
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,320
I know.

80
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,620
Type the threadping powder in him

81
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,220
No.

82
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,780
It's...

83
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,700
It's so scary down there.

84
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,700
So many sea bones.

85
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,740
Sir.

86
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,140
Let's leave here.

87
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,940
Be careful.

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,740
There might be a trap here.

89
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,780
Go together.

90
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,340
Go.

91
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,660
Sir, over there.

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,600
But you only have a gun

93
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,420
Uncle, this is good eye power

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Wait

95
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,280
Don't move

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,040
I'll find out your way

97
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,500
Landlady, is that a good idea?

98
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,020
Since you told me,

99
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
I'll try to solve it.

100
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,940
meow

101
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,460
I'll watch the other out.

102
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,100
We still have a deal.

103
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,380
We can cross the bridge as soon as we meet.

104
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
Sir.

106
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Turn left.

107
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,260
Turn right.

108
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,100
Is it that hard?

109
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,940
No. It's easy.

110
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
It's going to be a disaster.

111
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,100
The two are about to have an affair.

112
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,320
What's going to happen API?

113
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,300
robiÄ‡

114
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,020
Here is the control room.

115
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
No one

116
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
and no ghost

117
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
So this ghost ship is actually a base

118
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Go

119
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Sir

120
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Sir, what should we do?

121
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
How should we go back?

122
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Look

123
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
You, you, you

124
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
You can take me back

125
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
Thank you

126
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
Will there be water?

127
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
Yes

128
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Ah

129
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Didn't you say you would throw me on the boat?

130
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Why did you throw me into the water?

131
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Sir

132
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Stinky Lu Yu

133
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
Go, go, go

134
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
No

135
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
If Baxiang's morning dew is through the bow

136
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
The weight of the boat will be lighter

137
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
The water will definitely change

138
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,740
And now it's inseparable from the original

139
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Is the hot oil not for defence?

140
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
But to protect from water

141
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
This morning dew should not

142
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm here.

143
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,940
His Majesty.

144
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,020
Who is born out of the world

145
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,220
Can't beat fate

146
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,220
Close your eyes, I can see your face

147
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,980
Open your eyes, the north is cold

148
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,820
The sword is full of sky

149
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:46,020
Who has conquered the world

150
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,300
I can't meet your shadow

151
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,860
White hair in the sky

152
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,500
Hand in hand, reading the years

153
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,900
Looking back, ten thousand years

154
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,380
Who is born out of the world

155
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
You are a traitor

156
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
You can't get away with this

157
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,380
Xia Yan, you are awake

158
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,420
You scared me

159
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,220
When that officer Lu saved you

160
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,420
You were out of breath

161
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
Prince Lu Yan saved me?

162
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,180
Yes

163
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,380
Who changed your clothes for me?

164
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,060
Me?

165
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
But don't worry

166
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,860
I closed my eyes

167
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,860
I didn't see anything

168
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,460
Really

169
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,860
You are so ungrateful

170
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
What about the birthday cake?

171
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,260
I have taken it

172
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,060
Now it is taken by Mr. Lu

173
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,060
I don't know what he is going to do

174
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,660
Go, go and have a look

175
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,460
No, no, no

176
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,660
You just woke up and went to bed

177
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,460
Are you ok?

178
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,780
I am fine

179
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,660
Xia Yan is fine

180
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,060
Well

181
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Slow down

182
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,460
Yuan Jinxia

183
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,060
Yang Yue

184
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Your honor

185
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,660
Come in

186
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,460
Your honor

187
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,060
Golden silk, red jade, blue jade

188
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,260
Blue and white dragon, red jade

189
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,860
Your honor

190
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
This is worth 70 to 80 taels

191
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,460
I am afraid it is

192
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,860
I

193
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,060
Do you want it?

194
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,060
Nonsense

195
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,660
What are you talking about?

196
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,060
I think you want to eat it in private

197
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Otherwise you won't be so kind to the things in the box

198
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,260
Your honor, you are so funny

199
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,460
Your honor, how can you say that?

200
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,860
Jinxia is a coward

201
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,860
I think she is bold

202
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,260
No, I don't mean that

203
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Jinxia is not a heartless and not a coward

204
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,660
I know her

205
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,260
Although she is usually talkative

206
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,980
But she is upright and upright

207
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,060
She will never do this kind of nonsense

208
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Please check it out

209
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,060
I am thinking about the case

210
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,780
Why is she so heartless and bold?

211
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,580
How do you know

212
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,380
The birth steel is hidden under the boat?

213
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,460
I have no choice

214
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,260
So smart

215
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,260
I can guess it

216
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,780
In this case

217
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,380
You can guess it again

218
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,460
Will I put you in the box?

219
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,660
Your honor, you are so funny

220
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,980
I also found it strange under the water

221
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,860
First

222
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,380
If these eight boxes are moved to the boat

223
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,260
Then the boat will become lighter

224
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,420
There will be obvious changes in the water

225
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,180
After I went into the water

226
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,980
I found that there was no obvious change in the water

227
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,260
So these boxes must be still on the boat

228
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,380
Secondly

229
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,980
If it's just for defense

230
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,140
Eight boxes

231
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,780
Two pieces of stone spicy is enough

232
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,460
But yesterday I saw the guards moving stone spicy

233
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,820
There are many

234
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,780
Now I understand

235
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,380
It was to sink the boxes into the water

236
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,380
To prepare

237
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Then in your opinion

238
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,180
Who will be the prisoner?

239
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,860
The chess card next to the king's meal

240
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,660
The card

241
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,380
You

242
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,380
Please come here

243
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,460
Zifu

244
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,060
Go to take the card

245
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,780
Yes

246
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,180
Your honor

247
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
I have a question

248
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
I want to ask you

249
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
Want to ask

250
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,180
I don't know if you can help me answer

251
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,580
Ask

252
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,580
Your honor seems to have found

253
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,180
The mysterious place of the ghost ship at the beginning

254
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,580
How did you find it?

255
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,380
Have you heard of Sinan?

256
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,980
I have heard of it

257
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,580
That was two thousand years ago

258
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,180
Found a stone that attracts iron

259
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,180
This long stone can point to the south and north

260
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,580
They all call this stone a magnet

261
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,780
People who make ghost ships

262
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
Put this magnet around the boat board

263
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,580
Use the magnet's power

264
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,180
To attract other ships

265
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,580
And make it spin by itself

266
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,180
We can't even stand it

267
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
This ship is full of ghosts

268
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,980
Try hard to get close to the ghost ship

269
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
Everyone is strong

270
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,380
This is it

271
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,180
Our ship

272
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,580
Will come to the ghost ship for no reason

273
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,180
I know

274
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,580
It turns out that the person who designed the ghost ship

275
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,580
Is trying to use the legend of Huisheng Huiyin

276
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Make a panic on purpose

277
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,580
To sneak on the ship to run

278
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,580
You're not that stupid

279
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,980
No one ever said I was stupid

280
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,180
I'm also a big person

281
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Dad, look

282
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,180
The people in this painting

283
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
Car, boat, bridge

284
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,980
And this raw place, the prison

285
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,780
Every scenery is so exquisite

286
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,980
Even the ship on the seawater

287
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,180
Is also simulated as life

288
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,580
It's really a treasure at that time

289
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,780
This royal jade

290
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
Really didn't let us down

291
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,380
I heard that Zhang Zeduan

292
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,980
Only used one year to complete this long scroll

293
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,980
This is a strange night in the world

294
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,980
Really a trick

295
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,580
Godfather

296
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,980
There are many models in this room

297
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,180
Is this painting real or fake

298
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,580
Not yet determined

299
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,980
Mr. Xu also knows how to draw

300
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,380
You come to discuss the true value of this painting

301
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,580
Ge Lao

302
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,380
I only know how to make up words

303
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,380
Not very familiar with painting

304
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,180
But as far as I know

305
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,380
This picture

306
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,180
Should have Song Huizong

307
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,980
Written with a gold body

308
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,580
Qingming Shanghe picture

309
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Five characters title

310
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,780
This painting

311
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,180
Has Huizong's words

312
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,180
Have double dragon print

313
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,380
And a poem

314
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,980
How to see this painting

315
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,780
Not like a model

316
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,780
If it's real

317
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,580
Ge Lao, why don't you find someone to show it

318
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,580
Put it in the hall of Yan's mansion

319
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,380
Draw a picture

320
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,180
It can show that you are in the cabinet

321
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,580
The position of the head of the mansion is different from everyone

322
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,780
Yes

323
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,780
Yes, yes, yes

324
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
This is the right way

325
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,780
Good

326
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
Just do it

327
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,580
Manager Lu

328
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,580
I don't know if these

329
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,980
Is the lost birthday cake

330
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,580
Before the mansion

331
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,980
Yes, yes, yes

332
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,980
That's it

333
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,180
Two more times

334
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,580
Manager Lu

335
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,580
Where did you find these?

336
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
On the boat

337
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,380
On our boat

338
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,780
The box

339
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
Is in the water secret warehouse under the boat

340
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
As for

341
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,380
How to hide it

342
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,180
I have to ask you

343
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
Your chess board

344
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,180
Shao Xiuzhu

345
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,780
Why did the master invite me here?

346
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,180
Tell him

347
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,780
Those unconscious guards

348
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,580
It's not a secret box at all

349
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,980
There are no traces of drug on the scene

350
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
It was put by his own people

351
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,380
And the footprints in the warehouse

352
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,980
All are the footprints of the guards

353
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,580
And the scratches on the boat

354
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,380
It's all scratches from the outside

355
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,180
No outsiders have ever entered and left

356
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,180
This is obvious, I don't have to say

357
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,380
There is a mole, right?

358
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,980
Even if there is a mole

359
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,980
Why should I say it's me?

360
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,380
Guards who escorted the birthday cake this time

361
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,780
Each is strong and loyal

362
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,780
The guards of the state of Zheng

363
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,380
Each looks like a scoundrel

364
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,980
In fact, it's all a false move

365
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,380
And only you

366
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
Full of loyalty

367
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,980
It's a fake

368
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,180
I think your clothes and shoes

369
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,580
More oil than others

370
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,380
And

371
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,780
The idea of eating spicy and fragrant

372
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,780
You also came up

373
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,180
I'm afraid these words

374
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,780
Received the tide on the boat

375
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,580
So my chess board

376
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,780
I suggest using spicy

377
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,180
Seal the interface

378
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
Then you tell me

379
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,380
This thief is not you

380
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,780
Who is it?

381
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,380
You just changed your clothes

382
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,580
I think

383
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
You suggested using spicy oil to seal the incense

384
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,780
Not to prevent the tide

385
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,380
But to prevent water

386
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,180
So much for this

387
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,380
I have nothing to say

388
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,180
I didn't expect you, a bastard

389
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,580
Still hiding the trouble

390
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,580
You dare to touch the general's stuff

391
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,580
I almost died because of you

392
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,180
Manager Lu

393
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,980
Thanks to your help

394
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,580
I found the birthday cake

395
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,780
I will report to the general after I go back

396
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,780
The rest

397
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,380
Just leave it to the imperial guards

398
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,580
In that case

399
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,780
Then I'll ask someone

400
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Bring the box back

401
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,980
Come

402
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,580
Wait

403
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,980
This birthday cake

404
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,780
You can't take it away

405
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,780
Manager Lu

406
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,780
What do you mean?

407
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,780
This should be

408
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,780
Song Huizong's Qiuying picture

409
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,980
If I remember correctly

410
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
This was originally from the palace

411
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
General Qiu's suggestion back then

412
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Open horse market

413
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,180
This picture

414
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,580
The emperor has sent it to Ander

415
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,580
Trade horse skin

416
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,180
Why did it appear here?

417
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,780
This

418
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
I am Yan Zhuo

419
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,380
I don't know much about painting

420
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,780
Emperor to general Qiu

421
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,780
Hiding the real products of the trade with Ander

422
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,180
I have been looking for them

423
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,980
And the birthday cake you borrowed

424
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,580
It was also sent out by the palace back then

425
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,580
This

426
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,780
It can be seen that the state of the state

427
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
The relationship with general Qiu is not ordinary

428
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,980
If you let the emperor know this batch of items

429
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,980
You are responsible for sending it back to the royal mansion

430
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,980
I'm afraid to reduce the crime

431
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,780
Manager Lu

432
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,180
I really don't know

433
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
The content of the delivery of the goods

434
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,580
This matter should be thoroughly investigated

435
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,980
Manager Lu if there is anything

436
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,580
If you need my help

437
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,180
Please ask for instructions

438
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:03,980
it is good

439
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,180
Why did you steal the birthday cake?

440
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,580
To pay the debt

441
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,780
This reason is quite obvious

442
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,380
You designed the ghost ship to appear

443
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,580
Pay attention to everyone

444
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,380
And take the opportunity to transfer the birthday cake

445
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,380
Such a clever plan

446
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,380
It can't be done by you alone

447
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,780
Say it

448
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,380
Who else

449
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
What ghost ship I don't know

450
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,980
Don't fall on me

451
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,380
As for this birthday cake

452
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,980
I do things alone

453
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,580
One person

454
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,980
You are tough enough

455
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,180
Unfortunately, it's not used in the place

456
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,180
Where are the other two boxes of birthday cakes?

457
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,380
Don't talk nonsense

458
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,580
Kill if you want to

459
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,580
Obey

460
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,180
Zifu, I'll leave it to you

461
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,980
Yes

462
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,980
go

463
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,380
Enter the north town office

464
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,980
It's a kind of desire to die

465
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,980
Sir

466
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,180
There is nothing we want to find

467
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,980
Do you think Xiao Xu will be mistaken?

468
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,780
impossible

469
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,180
General Guanxuan has a habit

470
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,580
Is to record his own bold little things

471
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,380
This book is not in these boxes

472
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,380
It must be in the other two boxes

473
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,780
and

474
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,180
This book

475
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,980
Is the biggest evidence of General Guanxuan's testimony

476
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,380
Be sure to find it

477
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,780
You order Wang Fangxing

478
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,180
Don't arrange people to patrol tonight

479
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:13,780
Yes

480
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
In addition, there is one more thing

481
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,180
Remove the body of the guard Sha Qiuzhu

482
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,180
Yes

483
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,580
Stealing these birthday cakes with such care

484
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
I want to see

485
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,780
What are you really

486
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,180
Brother Sha

487
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,380
It's me

488
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
Xie Xiao

489
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Why are you here

490
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,180
I've been waiting for Brother Sha in the old place

491
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,580
Brother Jing is not back yet

492
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,980
How can I sit down

493
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Brother, don't worry

494
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,980
I'll take you out now

495
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,180
Brother, what's wrong with your leg

496
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,180
Brother

497
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,780
Look at my guard

498
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
Suddenly withdrawn

499
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,180
I suspect there is a trap in here

500
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
I'm afraid it's not safe

501
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
I'm afraid it's not safe

502
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
I'm afraid it's not safe

503
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,380
There is no trap in you, don't worry about me

504
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,780
Listen to me

505
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,780
At this point

506
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,380
You hurry out

507
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,980
Take away the two boxes of birthday cakes

508
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,380
We finally got it

509
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,180
Don't fall into their hands again

510
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,780
Go

511
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,380
Big brother

512
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,380
No one is on the deck

513
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,980
I can take you out

514
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,580
Big brother

515
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,780
go

516
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,380
Slow down

517
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,180
Sir

518
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,380
The other party has been on board

519
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,180
How many people

520
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,580
I see only one person at the moment

521
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,580
I'll go get the people now

522
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,780
Wait

523
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,380
Order

524
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,780
No one is allowed to move

525
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,580
Yes

526
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,780
Where did those two boxes of birthday cakes go

527
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,380
How can't you find it

528
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,780
Sha Xiu said he didn't know about the ghost ship

529
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
How could you not know

530
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,780
The appearance of that ghost ship

531
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Obviously want to transfer our attention

532
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,980
Will those two boxes of birthday cakes

533
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,980
With the ghost ship

534
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,380
Become a sea together

535
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
Sha Xiu

536
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,980
Don't talk

537
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,580
Hero

538
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,580
Good man

539
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,980
You have something to say

540
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,780
Mr. Sha wants birthday cakes

541
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,380
go

542
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,380
Or I'll take you there

543
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,980
Hero

544
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,380
You have something to say

545
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,980
Don't you just want birthday cakes

546
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
I know where

547
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,180
Hero

548
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Where are you taking me

549
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,180
Stop talking nonsense

550
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,380
Give me a quiet

551
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,580
He is the mouth of the Xinyuwei

552
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,580
Kill him

553
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,380
Big brother

554
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,780
You know I never kill women

555
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,980
Big brother

556
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,980
You said this is also very hurtful

557
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,580
I am a six-door

558
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,180
Jin Wei is a six-door

559
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,580
Do you know how many cases

560
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,780
How could I be his dog

561
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,780
Stinky girl

562
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,580
What tricks do you want to play again

563
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,180
Dare not dare not dare hero

564
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,380
I'm afraid of the words

565
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,380
To be honest

566
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,380
I've seen Jin Wei for a long time

567
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,980
I wanted to save Brother Sha

568
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,580
But Brother Sha hurt a leg

569
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,580
I am a woman

570
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,780
I can't take her away

571
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,380
Hero, one step away from the sky

572
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,980
I don't want to kill you either

573
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
But you don't worry

574
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,180
Is there an ambush on this ship

575
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,980
Even if there is an ambush

576
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,180
You are my hostage

577
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,780
Liang, they dare not do anything

578
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,180
You look down on me too much

579
00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:08,780
I'm just a little

580
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,380
Still call yourself a rich man

581
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,180
Sir Lu, save me

582
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,380
Hurry up and save me

583
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,580
Don't move

584
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180
You hurt my brother Sha's leg

585
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,580
So what

586
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
What can you do

587
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,380
I want you to change a leg

588
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,180
Stop

589
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,980
Be honest

590
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,580
Brother, you go quickly

591
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,780
Lu Yi, let us go

592
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
Otherwise I will kill him

593
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,580
You want to kill, you want to kill

594
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,380
Let go

595
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
What does it have to do with me

596
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,980
I said you caught me as a man

597
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,780
This is useless

598
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
You let me go

599
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,580
Don't move

600
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,580
Brother, be careful

601
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,780
Don't move

602
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,180
Ok, calm down

603
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,180
Don't move

604
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,180
Jin Xia

605
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,180
Brothers, go quickly

606
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,580
go

607
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,180
Big brother

608
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,180
go

609
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,380
Jin Xia, how are you

610
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,180
Are you okay

611
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,380
Da Yang

612
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,380
Is my master dying

613
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,780
You almost killed him

614
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,980
It was the Sha Qiuzhu who pushed him over

615
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,180
and

616
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,580
I have withdrawn my internal force just now

617
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
His injury

618
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,180
Will not be worse than a tree

619
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
I have to go to the hospital

620
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
The wound on the body is even worse

621
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,380
you

622
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,580
Da Yang, let's go

623
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,580
go

624
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,780
Give me some medicine

625
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,980
go

626
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,180
Xia Ye

627
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
Xia Ye, how is your injury

628
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,980
Nothing, skin wound

629
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,580
By the way, what is the origin of that masked man

630
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Did you see it

631
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,380
About 72 inches

632
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,380
It can be seen that the skill is not ordinary

633
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,780
And the material of the mysterious is ice silk

634
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,780
I think this man

635
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,980
Should be a bit of a source

636
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,980
I see you later

637
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,180
Still a little bit away from that Lord Lu

638
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,380
Dad is right

639
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
We just have to be respectful to him

640
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,380
It seems that the batch of birthday steel

641
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,580
Is a strong hand

642
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,780
You said how would Lord Lu Yan deal with him

643
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:34,980
Chonggong

644
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,180
Situan

645
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,380
How to deal with love

646
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,380
We just have to do as ordered

647
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,780
Don't let him make a mistake

648
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,780
That Lu's inner half is sinister and cunning

649
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
How can you not make a mistake

650
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,380
You also saw

651
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,780
When he hurt my throat before

652
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,980
I didn't even blink

653
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,380
Really almost done

654
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,380
Let me see

655
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,780
Nothing

656
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,180
I am Wei Ying from Yangzhou

657
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,980
I don't know the Lord of the Imperial Guards is here

658
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,780
I have a poem

659
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,780
Lord Wei, no need to be polite

660
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:06,980
Lord Wei

661
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,780
This is a serious crime that we Jin Yiwei arrested

662
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,380
And six boxes of evidence

663
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,780
I want to trouble Lord Wei

664
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,980
Send them all together

665
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,180
To the police station for investigation

666
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
Don't worry, Manager

667
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,380
I will send someone to do it right away

668
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,780
Come and carry these over

669
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Yes Yes Yes

670
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,580
All silver

671
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,380
You said the mysterious

672
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,180
Will Situan swallow this birthday steel

673
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,180
Come here

674
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,380
What are you talking about? How is it possible?

675
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,580
Manager is visiting suddenly

676
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,180
I didn't arrange a carriage

677
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,380
I hope the master will see you

678
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
It doesn't matter, Mr. Wei

679
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
It's also a little rice now

680
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,180
According to the old rules

681
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,180
The Yangzhou Household Department will arrange a party for us

682
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,780
Winding banquet

683
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,380
This Jiangnan famous dishes are very poisonous

684
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,380
I don't know where to take me later

685
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,580
It's best to be the Seven Wind Pavilion

686
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,380
By the way

687
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,380
This world is the most difficult to spring and summer

688
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
And you said that kind of

689
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,780
What? Empty heart meat garden, right?

690
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,980
You still remember

691
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,580
Yes, that's very delicious

692
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,380
I'll eat that later

693
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
I want to eat it now

694
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,780
Manager Lu

695
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,180
The front is the stronghold of Wu'an Gang

696
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,780
Wu'an Gang is a big gang of grass-growing

697
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,580
The private grass-growing in Yangzhou City

698
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,180
Half of them are in their hands

699
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,180
Wu'an Gang

700
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
When I was in Beijing

701
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,380
I heard the story

702
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,580
The leader of Wu'an Gang is called Xie Baili

703
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,180
People in the world are called Xiedandao

704
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,180
From Suzhou to Jiangning grass-growing

705
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
He has to be different

706
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,380
Jiangzhou and Liangsheng's big gang small village

707
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
All for his face

708
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,380
It's just that the years have grown up

709
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,380
Don't come out

710
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,580
I'll give you the things in the gang

711
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
All handed over to the leader of Zhuque Hall

712
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Shangguanxi

713
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,580
Who is that little sister?

714
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,380
I'm asking you

715
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,580
I think it's the leader of Zhuque Hall, Shangguanxi

716
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,180
The teacher is from Nan Shaolin

717
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,580
The sword technique is weak

718
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,980
Don't look at her as a woman

719
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,980
Three years ago

720
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
I picked up the grass-growing in Jiangning by myself

721
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,580
After that, I put it in the hands of Wu'an Gang

722
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,580
I ask you

723
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
When you joined the gang

724
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,380
What did you say to the ancestors?

725
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,180
Since I joined the Wu'an Gang

726
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,580
I must have been loyal to the ancestors

727
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,780
If there is a bad news, I will die

728
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,180
This side

729
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,980
Betrayed the gang members for you

730
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,380
Betrayed the gang leader

731
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,580
This side

732
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,980
Betrayed the gang leader for you

733
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:46,980
Don't let go

734
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:47,980
Throw it down

735
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,580
Master, please spare my life

736
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Master, please spare my life

737
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,980
Under the light of the sky

738
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,180
How dare you use your own heart

739
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,780
stop

740
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:54,780
Xia Yan

741
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,380
stop

742
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,180
Lord

743
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
Shangguan Hall leader

744
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,380
Long time no see

745
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,380
How are you recently

746
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
A lot of officials

747
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,380
I'm willing to eat

748
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,780
It's great to have a piece of tile covered

749
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,780
These officials have some eyes

750
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,780
This is the imperial guard from the capital

751
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,980
Jinli Lu

752
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,180
Lord Jinli

753
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,980
He is the leader of the Wu'an Gang, Shangguanxi

754
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,380
The people in the government are idle

755
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,380
Don't you have anything to do?

756
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,180
Even the private affairs of my Wu'an Gang

757
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
I have to come and roll

758
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,780
Xie Xiao

759
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,580
I don't know what I have done

760
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,580
To be so serious

761
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,380
It's you who hurt my brother Sha

762
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,580
I want you to return a leg

763
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,580
It turned out to be you

764
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,380
you

765
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,380
Even the imperial guard and the people of the Six Sages Sect are here

766
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,180
Shangguan Hall leader

767
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,580
This is my gang's young gang leader

768
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
It turns out to be the young gang leader of the Wu'an Gang

769
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,980
Don't be polite

770
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:05,980
Say it

771
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,380
Why are you here

772
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,380
Junior brother

773
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,580
My junior brother is reckless

774
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,780
Please forgive me

775
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,380
Why did Shangguan Hall leader take private action?

776
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,780
The country has its own laws and rules

777
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,580
He broke the rules of the Wu'an Gang

778
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,380
No punishment

779
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,380
Can't be convinced

780
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,380
Then don't use private action

781
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,580
Want people to die

782
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
I think

783
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
Shangguan Hall leader

784
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,780
Just give this person a lesson

785
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,980
It won't really kill people

786
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,780
Right Shangguan Hall leader

787
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,980
Lord Zhi Fu is right

788
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,580
Today's matter is really a misunderstanding

789
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,980
We still have help

790
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,380
I can't accompany you

791
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,580
Don't eat

792
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,340
Three years

793
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,980
You are finally back

794
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Go home with me

795
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,180
I don't go back

796
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,380
You don't go back

797
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,980
This is what you call a good thing.

798
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,380
Is it easy to cause trouble for the Imperial Guard?

799
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,580
Old Master has let go of his words last year.

800
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,580
He and the officials are not related.

801
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,080
Forget it. I'll handle this matter myself.

802
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,780
Since last winter, Old Master's health has been not good.

803
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,380
Impossible. I've been asking around.

804
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,380
I never heard that he's not in good health.

805
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,580
Old Master is strong. How can he show his weakness outside?

806
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,780
How about this? Go back with me first.

807
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,580
We can discuss whether to accept the new Chief.

808
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,180
But how many more years can you wait for me?

809
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,980
Three years ago, he forced me to marry you.

810
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
I left home and ran away.

811
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,980
He must still be mad at me.

812
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,180
You're my senior who taught me martial arts.

813
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,180
How can I marry you?

Episode 16

816
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,980
Lu Jingli wants to interrogate Sha Xiuzhu.

817
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,780
Let me take someone there.

818
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,980
What? Lu Yi and Lu Jingli from the capital.

819
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,980
Don't you know?

820
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,980
Your Majesty, I will remember your teachings.

821
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,380
I will be a good person.

822
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,180
In the long rainy night, I'm lost.

823
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,380
I'm lost in thoughts.

824
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,580
The wind blows, the boat sails, and I'm shocked.

825
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:18,380
My heart is blank. A thousand miles of ambush comes.

826
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,580
Who is born out of the world?

827
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,580
It cannot compare with fate.

828
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:34,180
Close your eyes so I can see your face.

829
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,380
Open your eyes and see the coldness in the back of your eyes.

830
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,900
The sword is full of

831
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,900
the sword is full of

832
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,700
who has conquered the world?

833
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:52,700
No sound, the sword rises and goes.

834
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,900
The fate turns,

835
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,500
seeing through the changes in life.

836
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:06,100
Like parting, parting is too sad.

837
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:12,620
The golden days of the past

838
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:18,620
meet the day you were born.

839
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:25,620
From blood to white hair, we spend our years together.

840
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:32,620
In the blink of an eye, a thousand years pass.
