00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

Episode 16

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You mean this kid is still alive

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where is he now

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've been looking for a long time

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No result

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Finally, I gave up

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Since this kid is not dead yet

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I must find him anyway

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Brother Yang

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can you take me to

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The places you were looking for

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Maybe we can find other traces

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ok

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You are not here

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm here

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm here

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No flower

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ax

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's ok, you can go out

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
With your brother Yuan

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can ensure you won't lose

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Tongchui

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to be rich

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't forget to share with me

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Brother Lu

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Brother, you are back

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If I don't come back

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How do you know

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
My cousin learned to play cards

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I taught her

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She doesn't know how to play

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I taught her

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not a good girl

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not a good girl

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not a good girl

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not a good girl

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I taught her

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She doesn't know how to play

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I taught her

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Although it's a world thing

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's fun to play when you are free

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
My cousin is always weak

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't teach her

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Brother

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Brother Lu, don't worry

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have a good relationship with Miss Mi'er

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We have the same ambition

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't teach her

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Brother Lu

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You have such a beautiful cousin

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't tell me

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you afraid of being robbed?

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Miss

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They are going to have a fight

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mr. Lu

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Your uncle and aunt

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Asked you about your marriage many times

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They want you and your cousin

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To get married

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think you are

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Friendship and friendship

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't let them be anxious

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mr. Xie

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't talk nonsense

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Maybe

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Mr. Lu's favorite person is Miss Mi'er

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right, Brother Lu?

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If I say yes

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What will you do?

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Of course I congratulate

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Miss Mi'er knows how to manage

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We are a perfect match

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Great

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a great joy

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Miss

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's up?

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Two people came out

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
One man and one woman

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Said they are looking for young master

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They told me that Dayang is looking for Mr. Xia

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's Dayang

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The other must be sister Shangguan

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sister

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Miss Shangguan

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Dayang

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Jinxia

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dayang

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Long time no see

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are still naughty

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You are so naughty

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I am worried about you

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sister Shangguan

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How did you find here?

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Master Lan told us

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We went to Hangzhou

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And ran to Guan Yi

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But we found that

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You didn't stop at Guan Yi

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wu Anbang is in Hangzhou

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I thought you wouldn't

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Use the name of Guan family

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So I asked someone

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I know you went to Chunyu

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And ran here

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Smart

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sir

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sister

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sir Lu

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sir Lu

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sister, why are you in Hangzhou?

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Xie Xiao

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You left Yangzhou for a long time

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I came to Hangzhou this time

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To take you back

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is my cousin

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Chu Yimi

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Shangguan Xun

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yang Yue

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't be polite

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Cousin's friend is my friend

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Not to mention

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Yuan is my benefactor

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Mr. Yuan

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You mean him

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is my brother

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't go out

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He calls me master Xia

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are the only one who calls me master

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So he is a little bit not used to it

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sister

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We don't talk

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What I sent you

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You received it

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Since you have received it

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I guess Xie Xiao has thought it through

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I guess you have seen it

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's great

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Come on, sister

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Today everyone is here

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I take this opportunity to announce one thing

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
My divorce letter

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Sister has received it

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
From today

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Between us

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's clear

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sister, right

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The marriage contract of the Wuge Xie Xiao has been canceled

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The steel has been returned

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
From now on

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Male and female marriage

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Interference

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes, interruption

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Jinxia, look

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I said it

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The marriage of the Wuge Xie Xiao

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Has finally ended

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Me and sister

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The two victims

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Have been released

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sister

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
From now on

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You can go to find

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Your own happiness

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Sister Shangguan

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's talk

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Jinxia

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I have something to say

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mr. Xie

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I recently

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have practiced a boxing technique

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I want to ask you for advice

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's go

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yang Yue

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What are you doing

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Nothing

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Some things have been delayed for a long time

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It should be solved together

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What do you want from me?

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Just say it

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What are you doing?

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Sister Shangguan

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is my fault

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I apologize to you

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you pity me

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You don't have to

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Xie Xiao's loyalty to me

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's not my intention

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But she wrote the marriage contract

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's really because of me

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I didn't handle these problems in time

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Make you embarrassed

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's my negligence

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I appreciate your good intentions

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Apologize and you will be free

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I apologize to you

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Not to pretend to be a good person

218
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
To act like a good person

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Although we have known each other for a long time

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The relationship is not deep

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But it's a common thing

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In my heart

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I really like you

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You and I are not a person who is stubborn

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't want to let you hate me because of Xie Xiao

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If so

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will be sad

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In the eyes of others

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I thought you care more about me

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What kind of rival?

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I do care more about you

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sister Shangguan is a hero in Jin

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Just by this

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
She is not as good as an ordinary man

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I admire her in my eyes

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You are sweet

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I have learned a lesson today

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then you don't angry with me?

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You said so

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why should I be angry?

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Moreover, love between men and women

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Can't be forced

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Anyway, I want to thank you

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If you didn't force her

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know when I can believe it

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't mean Xie Xiao

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I also told her

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You think she is not mean

250
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It has nothing to do with me

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You just said

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We are not stubborn

253
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You underestimated me

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Afraid that I will make trouble to you

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I seem to be for a man

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Who is jealous and has a grudge against others

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I am mean

258
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I am afraid that you will make trouble to me

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Xie Xiao is really a blind man

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She put such a good sister

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Who doesn't know how to cherish

262
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If I am a man

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I will not let my sister suffer

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No wonder Xie Xiao likes you

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Even I can't be angry with you

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't be angry with you

268
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sister, you are so kind

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I will make friends with you

270
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In the future, you can call me Jinxia

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In case of trouble

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Are you sure that the child is not dead?

273
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Brother Yang means

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The child is still alive

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He promised to take me to find him

276
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Lian

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why are you afraid that Yan Shi Fan will find you?

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He is in the capital

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I am in Jiangnan

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It won't be easy to find

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ok, be careful

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I will go with you

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Brother, thank you

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why do you say thank you to me?

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Pack your things

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I will go outside to see if Ma Shan is here

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Go

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Sister, you are the spirit in the heaven

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You must bless me

290
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
To find your child soon

291
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Hurry up

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Lian

293
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Are you ready?

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Put him down

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This

297
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This

299
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What happened?

300
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Ling'er was caught

301
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Go after him

302
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Ling'er

303
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Ling'er

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ling'er

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't worry

306
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Think about it

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What kind of people does Ling'er have?

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ling'er has been hiding for so many years

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There can't be any private revenge

310
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yan Shi Fan

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's possible

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's too late

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If Ling'er is caught by Yan Shi Fan

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's better to die

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hurry up, let's split up

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Don't worry

317
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They can't escape

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can't escape

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I forgot it in a hurry

320
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Ling'er told me

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Your tracking is the best in the world

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can't escape as long as you meet

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Right?

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Look

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is the clue

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
One is heavy, one is light

327
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Heavy, small, light, big

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It should be one man and one woman

329
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hurry up, chase

330
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Come back

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This way

332
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Brother

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What you said in the court

334
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's not true, right?

335
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I made a mistake

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't take it to heart

337
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's good

338
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I told you

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not close to my big brother

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I can say that I rarely have contact

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If my big brother has someone in his heart

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How can it be Min'er?

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's just a stranger

344
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You see it clearly

345
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But I heard this

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's like blaming me

347
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I didn't take good care of you

348
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Then how does big brother compensate me?

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What do you want?

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What do you want?

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Big brother

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Please help me

353
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let my parents allow me to ride

354
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Ok, I promise you

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Great

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you big brother

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You are the best

358
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Come again

359
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Come

360
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Wait

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You ate the egg

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Forget it

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Although you are not weak

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But you are not my opponent

365
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You are sorry to Shangguan

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You are going to compete with me because of this

367
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I have said many times

368
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Sister just treats me as her junior

369
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let her be with a man she doesn't like

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Will she be happy?

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You are blind

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Stop talking nonsense

373
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
As long as I haven't sat down

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I won't lose

375
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Ok

376
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Since you want to fight

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I will fight with you

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What are you doing?

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let go

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Xinxiao

381
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Xinxiao

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Why do you bully Dayang?

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I bully her

384
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
She is unreasonable

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She said I lost to my senior

386
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
She said she wanted to compete with me

387
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But she tried her best

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Senior, tell her

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You don't have me in your heart

390
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Ok

391
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
She is right

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I like you

393
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
In order to help you better

394
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I practice martial arts

395
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Learn to manage the things

396
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I want to be a woman that is suitable for you

397
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But I was wrong

398
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was wrong from the beginning

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Love is unreasonable

400
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Unreasonable

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Even if you try your best

402
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And try your best

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The other person is not your

404
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There is no end

405
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If what love knows is over

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And we are angry

407
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's fate

408
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If we are angry

409
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's fate

410
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Even if you run away from marriage

411
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I will be laughed at behind

412
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't want to give up

413
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I just think

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You are younger than me

415
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You are not sure

416
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I

417
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Until I saw the divorce letter

418
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I am sober

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
From the beginning to the end

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I am willing to do everything

421
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This relationship is my own business

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It has nothing to do with you

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You don't have to feel guilty

424
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Senior

425
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I

426
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Ok

427
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I feel a little tired today

428
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang to have a rest

429
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
As for Yangzhou

430
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can think about it

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

432
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

433
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

434
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

435
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

436
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

437
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

438
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

439
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

440
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

441
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

442
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

443
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

444
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I will go back to Wuan Gang

445
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you ready for the arrangement?

446
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Are you ready for the arrangement?

447
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
There can't be any mistake

448
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes

449
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you, Yan

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You are welcome

451
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Catch her

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Come here

453
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You can't hit her

454
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Why?

455
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You are the one who told me

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can't hurt her

457
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Watch her

458
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't let her run away

459
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Miss Zhai

460
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You told me

461
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You must send her back to the capital

462
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Why are you in such a hurry to see her?

463
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why are you in such a hurry to see her?

464
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know

465
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I just follow your order

466
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So

467
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This woman is very important to you

468
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I think so

469
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You have been looking for her for more than ten years

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Take the carriage

471
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Wait

472
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't worry

473
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's easy to be found

474
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You are following the order

475
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We caught her from Yangcheng Wan

476
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You forgot

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yangcheng Wan is famous for its master

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If we act rashly

479
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's easy to be found

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You think it's better to go to the capital later

481
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Or we are caught halfway

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We should wait until it's dark

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We will see

485
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Ok

486
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Miss Zhai

487
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You are late

488
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Sorry

489
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry

490
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry

491
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sorry

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You are better

493
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Why do you say sorry?

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Miss Zhai

495
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I have been feeling uneasy

496
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm afraid you would never talk to me

497
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I am too ignorant

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Now I know

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,800
I've done so many things that make you sad.

500
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,520
I...

501
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,240
I'm really too bad.

502
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,840
Senior sister, no matter what happens,

503
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,360
I hope we can be like before.

504
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,080
There is no gap.

505
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
All right, it's all over.

506
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,720
We still have the same love, don't we?

507
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,720
As long as you don't hate me.

508
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,040
Yuan Yang,

509
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,640
tell me,

510
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,600
what's the relationship between

511
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,800
Mr. Yuan and Miss Shangguan?

512
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,720
Why did Mr. Xie cancel the engagement

513
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,800
and say he made a promise to Mr. Yuan?

514
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,200
Miss, in my opinion,

515
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,680
the relationship between them is not simple.

516
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,920
I went through the corridor today,

517
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,440
and saw Mr. Yuan

518
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,960
go to catch Miss Shangguan's hand.

519
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Are you serious?

520
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,720
I dare not lie to you.

521
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,680
I knew it.

522
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,560
Miss, what did you know?

523
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,120
Mr. Xie and Miss Shangguan have been close since childhood.

524
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,200
Miss Shangguan adores Mr. Xie.

525
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,840
It's a pity that

526
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,080
the flowers are withered and the water is not clear.

527
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,640
Later, they met Mr. Yuan.

528
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,000
Mr. Yuan adores Miss Shangguan.

529
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
In order to fulfill his wish,

530
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,800
Mr. Xie wrote a divorce letter.

531
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,080
You're so smart.

532
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,480
You guessed it right.

533
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,360
You're so smart.

534
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
I'm sure.

535
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
Mr. Yuan wants to take this opportunity

536
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,720
to get into the marriage.

537
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,280
What should we do?

538
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,040
Miss Shangguan said a good thing today.

539
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,920
Love is like a word.

540
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,200
It's unreasonable and impossible to find.

541
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,320
If it should be yours,

542
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,200
you can't run away.

543
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,160
What's the relationship between this woman and Mr. Yuan?

544
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,360
Why does Mr. Yuan value her so much?

545
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,560
It's a pity.

546
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,720
The person who can go back with me

547
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,520
can't exceed six inches.

548
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,280
This is the rule I set a few years ago.

549
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,760
I was rejected by him many times when I showed my affection to Mr. Yuan.

550
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Is it because of this woman?

551
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,760
I can't let her go back to Mr. Yuan.

552
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,480
Isn't Yang Chengwan the number one in the world?

553
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,280
Why is it so useless?

554
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I've helped them for two hours.

555
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,400
But I still can't find it.

556
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,840
I think we should go now.

557
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,160
Yang Chengwan's tracking is so powerful.

558
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,880
Isn't it more dangerous to hide here?

559
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,480
Okay, I'll take him away.

560
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,680
Miss Jia, it's okay.

561
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
Mr. Yuan told me

562
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,320
you stayed in Yangzhou and didn't need to follow me to the capital.

563
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,720
Wait.

564
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,680
I'm doing this for your own good.

565
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,840
If Mr. Yuan knows you met his woman,

566
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,360
what will happen?

567
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,480
Let me do it.

568
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,880
After all, I'm the one who's in charge of the capital.

569
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,720
After all, I'm a woman.

570
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,400
Yuan Hao.

571
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Senior.

572
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,520
Go.

573
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,320
Brother Yang.

574
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,240
Take Ling'er away.

575
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,200
Stop them.

576
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
Go.

577
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,560
Leave them here.

578
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,840
Go.

579
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,120
Why didn't you stop?

580
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm badly injured.

581
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,800
How can I stop?

582
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,880
Useless.

583
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,440
What should we do now?

584
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
We've alerted them.

585
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,920
They must be hiding now.

586
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,840
I'll go back to the capital to ask Mr. Yuan for forgiveness.

587
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,480
You can go.

588
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,560
Mr. Yuan didn't ask me to go back.

589
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,320
You...

590
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,440
You...

591
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,320
Ling'er, what did I tell you before?

592
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,120
I told you not to show yourself.

593
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Look at us now.

594
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,360
Yan Shi Fan knows our whereabouts.

595
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,160
We have to find another place.

596
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,600
We'll find a place to hide as soon as possible.

597
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,960
I finally got together with Brother Yang.

598
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,840
Now I have a chance to find my sister's daughter.

599
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,800
How can I hide?

600
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,400
Ling'er.

601
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,280
Stop talking.

602
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,000
I've decided.

603
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,680
You...

604
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,240
And your Brother Yang.

605
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,160
It's all because of you.

606
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,200
Help me persuade them.

607
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,680
Ling'er.

608
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,920
Your senior is right.

609
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,360
It's hard to say whether we can find the child or not.

610
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,040
Besides, Yan Shi Fan has already targeted you.

611
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
It'll be dangerous if you hide here.

612
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,960
You'd better leave.

613
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,520
Brother Yang.

614
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,440
Didn't you promise me

615
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,400
to take me to find the criminal who abducted the child?

616
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,480
No matter what,

617
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,800
as long as there's a glimmer of hope,

618
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,640
I must find him.

619
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,560
Go.

620
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,600
Go.

621
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,760
What a good horse.

622
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
These horses are prepared for the court.

623
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,240
Of course they're different.

624
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,720
You have such a good cousin.

625
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,640
It's lucky to marry her.

626
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,800
You're not the one who wants to chase my cousin.

627
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,360
If you're interested,

628
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,120
I can tell your uncle and aunt.

629
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,240
Go.

630
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,360
Go.

631
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,480
Go.

632
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,960
Lu.

633
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,040
You know who I like, right?

634
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,640
I really think you and your cousin are a good match.

635
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,680
Right, Xun Xia?

636
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,960
It depends on whether you like the person in your heart.

637
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,760
No.

638
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,440
Why are you stopping me? I'm going to ride the horse.

639
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,360
Miss.

640
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
You can't ride this horse.

641
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,560
Miss Chun Yu.

642
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,520
I'll go and see.

643
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,400
It's really not like that.

644
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
Wait for me.

645
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
Why can't I ride it?

646
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,040
Miss.

647
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,120
You don't know how to ride a horse.

648
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,080
It's your first time riding a horse.

649
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
You can't ride it.

650
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,520
Miss Chun Yu doesn't know how to ride a horse.

651
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,880
Right.

652
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
My father didn't let me learn riding since I was a kid.

653
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,400
This horse looks wild.

654
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
It's your first time to learn riding a horse.

655
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,760
I think you should forget it.

656
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,720
Miss.

657
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,400
Can you take me to pick a suitable horse for you?

658
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,600
No.

659
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,560
Yun Bo, don't worry.

660
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,120
My brother and Mr. Yuan are here.

661
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,200
They are both good at martial arts and chess.

662
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
They won't make any mistakes.

663
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,880
No.

664
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,880
My father told me not to let you touch the horse.

665
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,480
If something goes wrong,

666
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,160
how can I explain it to him?

667
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,120
Father.

668
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,760
Even if father is not here,

669
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,720
he will help me no matter what.

670
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,240
Just a horse.

671
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,600
You can't stop me.

672
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,320
Well...

673
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,280
Miss Chun Yu, don't scare him.

674
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,800
It seems that he doesn't have much time to stay in the horse farm.

675
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,040
Old people are more worried.

676
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,840
If you insist on riding a horse,

677
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,120
we can go there and pick another horse.

678
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Yun Bo.

679
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,480
Mr. Yuan is talking for you this time.

680
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
I won't argue with you.

681
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,760
Let's go, Mr. Yuan.

682
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,440
Let's go to pick a horse.

683
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,200
Let's go.

684
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,760
Don't worry, Mr. Yuan.

685
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,640
Yun Bo, let them go.

686
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I'll keep an eye on them.

687
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,880
Thank you, young master.

688
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,080
Lu.

689
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,400
What did you mean by that?

690
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,160
Make it clear before you go.

691
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,240
Make it clear?

692
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,880
Do you like Yuan Jin Xia too?

693
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,600
Listen to me.

694
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I'm loyal to Jin Xia.

695
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,320
If you dare to fight with me,

696
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,600
I won't let you do that.

697
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,320
I never thought of fighting with you.

698
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,360
Then stay away from Jin Xia.

699
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,960
Don't let her follow you all the time.

700
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,800
She's a girl after all.

701
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,800
I don't mean to fight with you.

702
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
I just don't want to fight with you.

703
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,360
You...

704
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,480
It's you.

705
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,560
If it's not you,

706
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,080
it's useless to fight with me.

707
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I don't care.

708
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,680
Anyway, I know that I like her.

709
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,480
Let's go.

710
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,640
Eat.

711
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,280
It's all my parents' fault

712
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,520
for watching me too closely.

713
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,360
They even put me in trouble.

714
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,320
They both慌 ripping me apart from them.

715
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Does your parents worry about you either?

716
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,240
Guild Chief Yuan.

717
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,760
Can I call you brothers Yuan later?

718
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,440
Sure.

719
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,240
Okay, Brother Yan.

720
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,560
Miss Shangguan,

721
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,760
why are you here alone?

722
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,960
The horses here are well-bred.

723
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm here to learn how to raise them.

724
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,760
I didn't expect you to be interested in breeding horses.

725
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,880
I'm not interested.

726
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,400
I just want to improve the horse volume of Wu An Gang.

727
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,120
You really care about Wu An Gang.

728
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,200
But Xie Xiao,

729
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,520
I don't know how to cherish them.

730
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,560
Don't mention Xie Xiao.

731
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,160
Let me ask you.

732
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,840
What do you think of Miss Chunyu?

733
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Miss Chunyu?

734
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,720
She's pretty good.

735
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Miss Shangguan,

736
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,640
why do you suddenly ask me

737
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,840
about Miss Chunyu?

738
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,360
Did you misunderstand something?

739
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,280
How could she like me?

740
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,040
She doesn't like you.

741
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,800
She likes your eyes.

742
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,640
Jinxia?

743
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,680
How could that be?

744
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,880
She's a woman.

745
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,120
Right.

746
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,960
Miss Chunyu doesn't know about it.

747
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,400
I think she's just being silly.

748
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,840
I'm afraid she's in love.

749
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,080
Oh no.

750
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,400
I'm in trouble now.

751
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
No. I have to tell Jinxia.

752
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,960
Although Jinxia doesn't care about Xiaojie,

753
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,200
she's still a bit of a smart girl.

754
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,000
Even if she forgets it,

755
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,440
someone will remind her.

756
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,400
Remind?

757
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,400
Who?

758
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,520
Who will remind her?

759
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,200
You, Mr. Lu and Xie Xiao.

760
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,120
Among you three,

761
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,680
it's not hard to talk to Mr. Lu.

762
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,160
As for you,

763
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
compared to my junior,

764
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,800
you're more like a fish in the water.

765
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,920
You can't be too open.

766
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,840
Yes. You're right.

767
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,840
I'm not as smart as Mr. Lu.

768
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm not as good as Xie Xiao.

769
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,760
I'm just...

770
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,040
I didn't mean that.

771
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,200
Forget it.

772
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,560
I can't explain it to you.

773
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,440
Just tell me.

774
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,520
What's wrong with her?

775
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,720
You'll lose if you're full of water.

776
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,960
Some things

777
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,080
will come to an end if you don't make any effort.

778
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,640
I don't care about that.

779
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,240
Men should be tough.

780
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,800
Can you compete with me?

781
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,920
The loser

782
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,920
has to agree to a condition.

783
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,040
What?

784
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,560
You can't beat me.

785
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,120
Don't be so insincere.

786
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,760
I'm serious.

787
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,200
I'm even afraid of myself.

788
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,800
Besides, we haven't even started.

789
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,720
How do you know who will win?

790
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,720
I'm not interested.

791
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,280
How about this?

792
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,080
Let's use those war horses

793
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,640
to compete.

794
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,960
I'll use the wild horses

795
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
that don't have a tame.

796
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,240
You?

797
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,320
Choose the horse you like.

798
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,120
What do you think?

799
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,640
I advise you.

800
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
You'd better not use this horse.

801
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,520
What?

802
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,800
You're afraid that I'll lose?

803
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,400
Don't you see

804
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,800
that this horse is a fierce one?

805
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,960
Only you know about horses?

806
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,680
She likes my performance.

807
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
She's a horse, not a dog.

808
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,200
You doubt my ability, right?

809
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,320
Okay.

810
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,000
I'll show you what I can do today.

811
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,280
Hurry up.

812
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,080
Hurry up.

813
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,200
I think this horse is quite gentle.

814
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,440
Brother Yun, are you a fierce horse?

815
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,480
Can you ride a horse?

816
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,360
I don't know.

817
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm just a little bit.

818
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,200
Let's go over there to see the horses.

819
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,600
Okay.

820
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,480
Let's go.

821
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,440
Brother Yun.

822
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,640
My done!

823
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,560
Hurry up.

824
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,400
Hurry up.

825
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,680
We're running out of diamonds.

826
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,800
Watch out.

827
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
Stop!

828
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Stop!

829
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
Stop!

830
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Stop!

831
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Stop!

832
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Stop!

833
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Jinxia!

834
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
Jinxia!

835
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Miss Ning, are you all right?

836
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
I'm fine.

837
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
How are you?

838
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
It hurts.

839
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
You're hurt.

840
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
You're bleeding so much.

841
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Let's go to Yun Bo's place and see if there are any wounds.

842
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Yes.

843
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Yes.

844
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Yes.

845
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Yes.

846
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Yes.

847
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Yes.

848
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
Yes.

849
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Yes.

850
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Yes.

851
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Yes.

852
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Yes.

853
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Yes.

854
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Let's go to see if there are any wounds.

855
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Okay.

856
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Let's go.

857
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
You have to endure it.

858
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,440
This wound must be cleaned up in time.

859
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
How is it?

860
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Xie Yuanyuan, if those horses really hurt Miss Chunyu,

861
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
how will you explain to Master Chunyu?

862
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
It's okay.

863
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
It's all my fault.

864
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
I shouldn't have untied the rope of that horse

865
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,440
and let you be frightened.

866
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,440
That horse is not a normal person.

867
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Luckily, Master Lu stopped the horse in time.

868
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

869
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
I heard that the more fierce the horse is, the better.

870
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Right, Master?

871
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Yes.

872
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
If we tame that horse,

873
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
it must be a great horse.

874
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
But to tame that horse,

875
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
we need to have a matchmaker.

876
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Lu Yi, we just had an accident

877
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
before we had the match.

878
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
How about this?

879
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,440
We will use the horse we can tame

880
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
to have a match.

881
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
How about it?

882
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Xie Xiu, you have to do something bad, right?

883
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
You are so close.

884
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
I envy you.

885
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I can only chat with my brother since I was a kid.

886
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
He is always outside.

887
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,440
I can't see him all the time.

888
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
You have made friends with us.

889
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
When you come to the capital,

890
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
we will treat you well.

891
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

892
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,440
I will treat you well when we go to Yangzhou.

893
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Thank you.

894
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

895
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
You are so nice.

896
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
They all say so.

897
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Why?

898
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Didn't you invite me back?

899
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
I am useless.

900
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
I was already here.

901
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
But I was saved.

902
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Do you know who he is?

903
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
The one who made the blue jade hairpin.

904
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,440
And the head of the six mountains, Yang Chengwan.

905
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Yang Chengwan?

906
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
I forgot.

907
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Yang Chengwan came to Zhao Yu

908
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
because of the Lin family.

909
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Lin Ling and Yang Chengwan are together.

910
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
That is to say...

911
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
I am sorry.

912
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
I failed to complete the task.

913
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Please punish me.

914
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I will send someone to the south.

915
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
I will ask Lin Ling to bring her back.

916
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
You are useless.

917
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
I am guilty.

918
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Bastard.

919
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I didn't ask you to die.

920
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Thank you, sir.

921
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Get up.

922
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Sir.

923
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
I am guilty.

924
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,440
I will ask Lin Ling to bring her back.

925
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
I told you.

926
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
You are useless.

927
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,440
Lin Ling is stubborn.

928
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
She prefers to be a jade hairpin.

929
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
If she comes back,

930
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
she must be in a bad mood.

931
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,440
If she can think of a better way,

932
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
why bother to force her?

933
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,440
I want her to stay with me willingly.

934
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
This time, I have to go to Yangzhou in person

935
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
to meet her.

936
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
You go to prepare it immediately.

937
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Yes, sir.

938
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,440
You are the advisor of Lu Qian?

939
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Lan Qingxuan?

940
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Yes, sir.

941
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,440
But the Danqing Pavilion has just been closed.

942
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,440
I am worried that His Majesty has a problem.

943
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
I am afraid it is not appropriate

944
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
to recommend you to the palace at this time.

945
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
No hurry.

946
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
I can wait.

947
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
I believe that Mr. Xu can create a new plan.

948
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I will wait for you.

949
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I will wait for you.

950
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
I will wait for you.

951
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,440
I believe that Mr. Xu can create

952
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
a suitable opportunity to welcome me into the palace.

953
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
What is your specialty?

954
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
I recommend it to His Majesty.

955
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
I know the heaven and the earth.

956
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
I can do everything to see the wind and water.

957
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,440
This is the basic study of each method.

958
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,440
But I recommend many methods to His Majesty.

959
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440

00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,440
the difference between you and them.

that no one can understand

964
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
that there is no good and no evil.

965
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,440
There is good and evil.

966
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
It is the truth that good and evil are good.

967
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,440
It is the truth that good and evil are bad.

968
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
OK.

969
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Find a place to settle down

970
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
