45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
Why can't we find him after searching for a whole day?

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,400
It's all because that mountain is too big.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
So many brothers in the gang went to look for him, but Buyan didn't find him.

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Come.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,000
This is only the first day. With your ability, I believe that you can find him very soon.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Did I miss out on some clues?

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Master.

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Uncle Yang.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Girl.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,600
Why did you two meet?

56
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I met Brother Yang when we were in Yangzhou.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He happened to receive a letter from the Wu'an Gang.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,200
Yang Yue is in danger in Hangzhou.

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
So we came here together.

60
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
See if we can help.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,200
How is Yue'er?

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Dayang...

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
What happened?

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,600
He disappeared.

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Disappeared?

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Uncle Yang, Yang Yue and Dong Qisheng fell off the cliff together.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Fell off the cliff?

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Where? Hurry and take me to see.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Master, don't worry. We already went to the bottom of the cliff to look for him.

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
Although we haven't found Dayang yet,

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
but if we can't find him now, it's good news.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Maybe he was saved by a good person.

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,400
Uncle Yang, don't worry.

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,000
I believe that Yang Yue will be fine.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
We will still look for him.

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
Yes.

77
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Senior Sister.

78
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
How is it? Did you find him?

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
Jinxia found the footprints of the villagers at the bottom of the cliff.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
She suspected that he was saved by someone else.

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,800
But we looked for him in the nearby village for a day.

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
We still couldn't find him.

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,600
You searched the nearby village?

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll send someone to look for him.

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,200
Senior Sister, don't worry.

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Don't worry. I already arranged for a lot of people to ask around.

87
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
As long as Yang Yue is still alive, we can definitely find him.

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,600
But...

89
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Senior Sister, look. It's already dark outside.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,200
The road in the mountains is not easy to walk. Don't go tonight.

91
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,800
Rest well. When you're ready, we'll go look for him.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yang Yue

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Sir.

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I heard from Sen Fu that Officer Yang went to Hangzhou City.

95
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,000
He already knew about Yang Yue's disappearance.

96
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
Although Teacher said it so easily,

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,800
I can see that he's very worried about Dayang.

98
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Before, I always thought that my tracking skills

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
can only be achieved by Teacher.

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,600
But now that Dayang is gone, I can't do anything.

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Since when did you start to have so little confidence in yourself?

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Xie Yuanyuan and I searched the nearby village.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,200
We still couldn't find him.

104
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
If Dayang was really rescued, how could we not find him?

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,800
Maybe it's Yang Yue who doesn't want to be found.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Dayang is a person who values his feelings.

107
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,400
If he's fine, why didn't he come back?

108
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,200
You look like the Yuan Jinxia that I know.

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Dayang is gone.

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,200
My teeth and teeth are gone.

111
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I grew up with him. We never separated.

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,400
Although he always calls me Xia Yan,

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,000
I know that he loves me like a real sister.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,600
He's always been so nice to me.

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

116
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I hope so.

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
Oh, right, Sir.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
Where's Miss Min?

119
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Something happened to Sima's Mansion. She probably has nowhere to go.

120
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,800
When we found her, she really had nowhere to go.

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,800
But I already asked Cen Fu to arrange a place for her.

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Who is so cruel?

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
According to Hangzhou's government, she's a criminal.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
But she's already been caught.

125
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,800
And she also admitted that she wanted to steal something from Chunyu Mansion.

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,400
After she was found, she was killed.

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Do you believe it?

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
I don't believe it.

129
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,600
The person behind this is also very suspicious.

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,000
This is the Hall Leader's Order of the Zhuque Hall.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
Senior Sister, you...

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
This token is yours.

133
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,200
I took it for you for three years. It's time to return it to you.

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,200
Senior Sister, the Wuwan Gang can be without me, Xie Xiao.

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
But it can't be without you. You are the main shareholder of the Wuwan Gang.

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
I can't accept this token.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Xie Xiao, after going through so much, I finally understand what I want.

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
After Yang Yue disappeared, I realized

139
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
that I'm already used to her being by my side.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,800
She's always thinking about me.

141
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Now that she's gone, I want to get her back.

142
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,000
From now on, the Wuwan Gang's matter will be related to you.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,400
Senior Sister, the Wuwan Gang has great power and a lot of land.

144
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,000
If it's for someone with a lot of ambition, it might be a good thing.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But for me, it's not a good thing.

146
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,800
But for me, you know that I'm already used to those free lives.

147
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Not to mention the Hall Leader. I don't want to be the Chief of the Gang.

148
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
So I'll be the one to find Yang Yue.

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
You'll be in charge of the Gang.

150
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Stop! How can you say such irresponsible words?

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Senior Sister, I...

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,800
I grew up with you. I like your unparalleled personality.

153
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
But I'm too tolerant of you.

154
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,200
That's why you're now so irresponsible.

155
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,600
Xie Xiang, listen to me.

156
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
From now on, I'm no longer the Chief of the Wuwan Gang.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll return your token.

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,800
No matter how hard the Wuwan Gang is, you must bear it.

159
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,600
Senior Sister, I...

160
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,400
Xie Xiang, I'm a woman. I can do it.

161
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,000
You can do it too. Don't let me look down on you.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So in my world, there are only you and the Wuwan Gang.

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,800
I've thought it through. I want to pursue what I want.

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,800
Okay. Since you've already decided, I'll respect you.

165
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Senior Sister, don't worry.

166
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,200
I won't let you down.

167
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm glad you understand. You've done something for me.

168
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
I heard that the Tang's Flower Festival was held in Hangzhou.

169
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
The kidnapped officials were all there.

170
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
They asked His Majesty to increase the number of soldiers.

171
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
They even raised the donation to increase the army and food supplies.

172
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,400
I think the Chief wouldn't mind, right?

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Why are you telling me this?

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,800
The matter about the mine has been discovered by Lu Yi.

175
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
As long as the Chief is willing to take responsibility for this,

176
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
as for those noble ladies, you will solve it.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,400
Your son's plan is really beautiful.

178
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,600
Those noble ladies are afraid of death. It's easy to try to stop them.

179
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,400
But the mine is a place to be killed.

180
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
You think that even if there is no such crime,

181
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,200
wouldn't the Chief be guilty of killing?

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
There are too many lions. They aren't afraid of being bitten.

183
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Are you afraid of being punished?

184
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,000
The court has a son to protect you.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,200
He's the most useful to you.

186
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
I believe that the Chief would understand.

187
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Move aside!

188
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
Move aside!

189
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Go!

190
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
Yang Yue?

191
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Yang Yue!

192
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
We're here!

193
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
We're here!

194
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
We're here!

195
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Yang Yue!

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Yang Yue!

197
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
Come out!

198
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,000
I know it's you. Why are you hiding from me?

199
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Yang Yue!

200
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Come out!

201
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,000
I know you're not dead. Why are you hiding from me?

202
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yang Yue!

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,200
Yang Yue!

204
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Yang Yue!

205
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Come out!

206
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,600
Sir, I didn't find any evidence on Yan Shi Fan's boat.

207
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,400
Yan Shi Fan is not stupid. He must have already destroyed all the evidence about the Sima Chang'an case.

208
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,600
And the Chunyu Manor was destroyed.

209
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,000
It's very possible that it was because they found out the real identity of Sima Chang'an.

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Then how should I investigate this matter?

211
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,400
Don't worry.

212
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,800
Collect the evidence from other places.

213
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,600
One day, I will have Yan Shi Fan pay the corresponding price.

214
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,200
Who sent you here?

215
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,600
You killed our Second Master,

216
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,800
and Chief Mao's men. We must take you back.

217
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
Chief Mao?

218
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
The Japanese pirates, the investment, Mao Hai Feng?

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Yang Yue, aren't you going to hide from me?

220
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,400
I don't believe you won't come to save me.

221
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,400
You want me to go back and report to the police, right?

222
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
What do you want?

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,200
I can go back with you.

224
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,400
Go!

225
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Go!

226
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
Chase!

227
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
I know that you won't leave me alone.

228
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Miss, you've mistaken me.

229
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Stop!

230
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,400
If you don't make it clear, you're not allowed to leave.

231
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you know that I've been looking for you for so long?

232
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,200
Your face...

233
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
You keep saying that you want to be responsible for me.

234
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,800
Don't you want to be responsible?

235
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,600
I can't keep up with you anymore.

236
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,400
Yang Yue, are you still a man?

237
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
But you have a hole in your face. Why are you so stubborn?

238
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,600
If I didn't lure you out today,

239
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,800
would you hide from me forever?

240
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,800
Do you know that everyone is worried about you,

241
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,200
but you're thinking about your pride?

242
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,400
You... You've disappointed me.

243
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,800
I...

244
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,200
I...

245
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
It's good that you're alive.

246
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Yue'er!

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Yue'er!

248
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600
Father.

249
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
Father.

250
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
A man is a man.

251
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
What's the point of this injury?

252
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
It's good that you're alive.

253
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,400
It's good that you're alive.

254
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
Dayang!

255
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
Dayang!

256
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
You're finally back!

257
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
Are you okay?

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Your face...

259
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Your face...

260
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Your face...

261
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,400
Your face...

262
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
Yi'er, hurry.

263
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Show it to Dayang.

264
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Here, sit down.

265
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
How is it?

266
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,400
Your internal organs are a bit damaged.

267
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
Internal organs?

268
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Dr. Lin, can you get better?

269
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Fortunately, I came back in time.

270
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
I have to use a needle to pierce the blood every day, and then use a medicine.

271
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,200
Remember, don't walk around these days.

272
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
You have to rest well.

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,800
You'll be able to recuperate in about a month.

274
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
Then my face...

275
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's go back and rest.

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Let's go. Before the injury is healed, you can't walk around.

277
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,600
Senior Brother, go with me to get the medicine.

278
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,000
Let's go.

279
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Here, take a look.

280
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Senior Brother, it's here.

281
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Take a look.

282
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay.

283
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
Take a look.

284
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Take a look.

285
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Take a look.

286
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Take a look.

287
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Take a look.

288
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,160
The

289
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
What is it?

290
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,800
Lan Qingquan sent a letter saying that the Sanhua Conference has reached the capital.

291
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,200
All the court officials think that Wu Shouxu is not doing well,

292
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,000
so they led the pirates to enter the city.

293
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,400
They kidnapped those officials and the families of the victims to collect the ransom.

294
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,600
The officials are sending out reports to ask His Majesty to punish Wu Shouxu severely.

295
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,800
Are these people just thinking about the fish?

296
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,200
If Wu Shouxu and Yu Dayong weren't here,

297
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
Hangzhou would have been already trapped.

298
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,800
It's not the pirates' turn to steal the officials and the families of the victims.

299
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm afraid that there are a lot of people in here who are acting like a fool.

300
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,400
Sir,

301
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,000
before, Wu Shouxu tricked Wang Zhi to surrender to the government.

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,200
Then he went out and imprisoned him.

303
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
Why is that?

304
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,400
You only know one thing, not the other.

305
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,600
The outside world has been spreading rumors that Wu Shouxu is not trustworthy.

306
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,200
Actually, they don't know that it was the officials of the government who were not doing anything.

307
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,800
After Wang Zhi was killed,

308
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,000
Wu Shouxu immediately went to the government to ask the government not to kill him.

309
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,800
He didn't want to be caught by the officials and be kidnapped

310
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
and then be forced to release the pirates.

311
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Under the circumstances, Wu Shouxu could only imprison Wang Zhi.

312
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,200
Later, the pirates rebelled.

313
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
His Majesty was not happy and ordered to investigate this matter thoroughly.

314
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,200
If there was a slight mistake, Wu Shouxu would be expelled from the government.

315
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
The two states would also be in chaos.

316
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
This is too shameless.

317
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
No wonder they say that the scholars are sinister.

318
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,000
It's really not as good as the five of them.

319
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,400
Sir, Lord Wu sent someone to invite you to his residence.

320
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
He said that he has something important to discuss.

321
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,800
I know.

322
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
I was really upset.

323
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,200
I came a little later than I thought.

324
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Sir, you know that he wants to arrest you?

325
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,800
This matter is so serious. I'm afraid that he's already worried.

326
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,200
But Wu Shouxu and Liao Wenhua have a very close relationship.

327
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Liao Wenhua is also Yan Song's adopted son.

328
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Wu Shouxu is also a member of the Yan family.

329
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,200
If he comes to find you at this time,

330
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,400
would he want to help you please Yan Song?

331
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
You care about me so much?

332
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,400
It's about your safety. I should think about it more.

333
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
Don't worry.

334
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Wu Shouxu's position in the capital is indeed because Liao Wenhua came here with a sharp sword.

335
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Liao Wenhua himself is Yan Song's adopted son.

336
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,800
He was able to get past Yan Song and directly attacked the Emperor.

337
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
With Yan Shi Fan's personality, he definitely won't let him off.

338
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,400
Wu Shouxu must have realized this earlier.

339
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
So he's in a hurry to change his side.

340
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,400
Let's go. Let's go to the capital.

341
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,800
Let's go.

342
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,200
Did you do it properly?

343
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I already sent a message to Big Boss

344
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,000
to tell him to take over the mine.

345
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
Don't worry, Young Master.

346
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
This matter is of great importance to you.

347
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,800
It won't affect Big Boss.

348
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I believe he will agree.

349
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Lin Ling and Yang Chengwan have already arrived in Hangzhou.

350
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,200
Go and investigate their purpose in Hangzhou.

351
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,200
That means this woman is very important to you.

352
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,600
You've been looking for her for over ten years.

353
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes.

354
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,600
Leave.

355
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,200
You don't need to leave for such matters in the future.

356
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
Yes.

357
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
Open the door.

358
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,200
Yes.

359
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,800
Master, close it.

360
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Official Wu,

361
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,400
the imperial envoy, Lu Yi,

362
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,800
is invited to come to visit.

363
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Official Lu, I am sorry that I have not been able to meet you.

364
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,600
I am sorry that I have not been able to meet you.

365
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,200
I am sorry that I have not been able to meet you.

366
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,000
Official Lu, I am sorry that I have not been able to meet you.

367
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,800
I wanted to invite you to my manor.

368
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,800
But I was too free.

369
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,200
Please excuse me for asking.

370
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,400
What is this coffin?

371
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,800
My wife.

372
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,400
When she heard that I had imprisoned Wang Zhi,

373
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
she killed my wife.

374
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
She did it to take revenge on me.

375
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,400
Who is she?

376
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
Mao Hai Feng.

377
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,800
Official Lu, I am afraid that I have no energy to entertain you today.

378
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,000
Let's talk another day.

379
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,800
Men, bury her.

380
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,200
Yes.

381
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,600
But...

382
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Let's go.

383
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,400
She died not more than 3 hours ago.

384
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
This coffin was not carried here.

385
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,800
The carriage was the one that pushed it down.

386
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
The coffin has the most blood on the end.

387
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
There are traces of blood on the ground.

388
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Judging from the amount of blood,

389
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
there must be so much blood on it.

390
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
It must be stolen when someone just died.

391
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
The foot of the carriage

392
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,200
is less than two miles away from here.

393
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Sir, should we go and have a look?

394
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Let's go and have a look.

395
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Let's go.

396
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Let's go home.

397
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Hurry up.

398
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Hurry up.

399
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Hurry up.

400
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Hurry up.

401
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Hurry up.

402
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Hurry up.

403
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Why are the villagers so strange?

404
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
The traces we've been looking for

405
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
disappeared when we arrived here.

406
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
The carriage should be in the village.

407
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,200
The cost of the horse-drawn carriage is not low.

408
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
But these villagers

409
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
don't seem to be rich.

410
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Didn't you notice?

411
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
When you just spoke,

412
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
there were three or four houses around.

413
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Someone was peeping at us.

414
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,200
This should be the gathering place of the people of the East Camp.

415
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Hurry up.

416
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Hurry up.

417
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Hurry up.

418
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Hurry up.

419
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Hurry up.

420
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Hurry up.

421
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Hurry up.

422
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Hurry up.

423
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Hurry up.

424
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Hurry up.

425
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Hurry up.

426
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Sir,

427
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
they are going to kill the man who killed the man.

428
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
We haven't figured out the situation yet.

429
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Don't be impulsive.

430
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Find a chance to withdraw.

431
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
How did you find this place?

432
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Did you bring the soldiers?

433
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Sir,

434
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Sir,

435
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
I'm not on the same side with them.

436
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I'm Wang Mazi.

437
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I was forced to do so.

438
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Sir,

439
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
I'll kill them first

440
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
no matter if there are soldiers or not.

441
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Don't be anxious.

442
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Do you think they can escape?

443
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Let's ask them clearly.

444
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
What did you say?

445
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Wang Mazi,

446
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
we meet again.

447
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
The wise don't talk in secret.

448
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
You are too careless.

449
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,200
The horse-horses are just hanging by the coffin.

450
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
You kidnapped Wu Shou Xu's wife

451
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
and killed her.

452
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Aren't you afraid that Wu Shou Xu

453
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
will cause you trouble?

454
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
The day Wu Shou Xu sent his wife,

455
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
he should have known the result.

456
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
He was the one who made a mistake.

457
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Do you want his wife to come back alive?

458
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Wu Shou Xu sent him.

459
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Stop talking nonsense.

460
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Go.

461
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Stop chasing.

462
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
What's the use of you?

463
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Sir.

464
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
You won't catch up with us.

465
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Sir,

466
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
you just took out all the silver.

467
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Yes.

468
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I don't lack silver.

469
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
You are a loser.

470
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
You should have given me the silver.

471
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I didn't expect that

472
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
these pirates

473
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
are hiding in a village.

474
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Don't the villagers know that?

475
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
And I don't think

476
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
they are being threatened.

477
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
And those pirates

478
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
are not all from the Eastern Camp.

479
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
They are not skilled in fighting.

480
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
But they are very strong.

481
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
The pirates from the early years

482
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
are from the Eastern Camp.

483
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
In recent years,

484
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
many people from the coastal areas

485
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
have joined them.

486
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
These people told their families

487
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
that they were looking for silver.

488
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
But they didn't expect

489
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
that the fastest silver

490
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,200
was being sold to Mao Haifeng.

491
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
This is a matter of losing their heads.

492
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
They dare not say it.

493
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
After a long time,

494
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
they are covered up.

495
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Men from a village

496
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
are all being pirates.

497
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Who can think of this?

498
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Sir,

499
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
we are in a thief's den today.

500
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
What surprised me was not the thief's den,

501
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
but Wu Shou Xu

502
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
personally gave his will

503
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
to Mao Haifeng.

504
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
The price is too high.

505
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
So Wu Shou Xu didn't want to catch the culprit.

506
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
That's the reason.

507
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Sir,

508
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
what are you doing?

509
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
You are hurt.

510
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
It hurts.

511
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
You know it hurts.

512
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
I told you not to be impulsive.

513
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Don't be impulsive.

514
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
If you keep doing this,

515
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
I will deduct your silver.

516
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Sir, don't.

517
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
You hurt your feelings when you mention silver.

518
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Can you be a little more obedient?

519
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Are you worried about me?

520
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Don't worry.

521
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
I am very lucky.

522
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
My mother has been very lucky for me.

523
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
I have gold armor and godly friends.

524
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
I am blessed with good luck.

525
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
I can be a hero.

526
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Even for me,

527
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
be careful in the future.

528
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Be more cautious.

529
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Okay?

530
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
I know.

531
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Let's go.

532
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Sir,

533
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
your silver was really a pity.

534
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Don't use silver as a weapon next time.

535
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
I feel bad.

536
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
I want to give the silver to the pirates.

537
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Stop.

538
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I won't give it to you when you go back.

539
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Okay?

540
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Really?

541
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Thank you, sir.

542
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Don't touch it.

543
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Don't get wet these days.

544
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
When it's removed,

545
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
it will be fine soon.

546
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

547
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
I'll go first.

548
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
If you feel uncomfortable,

549
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
tell me again.

550
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

551
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
What do you mean now?

552
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Are you going to

553
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
never let me see your face again?

554
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
I...

555
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I...

556
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I don't mean anything.

557
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
What's the difference

558
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
between seeing or not seeing?

559
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
When you and Master Xie

560
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
come back to Yangzhou,

561
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
we will have fewer opportunities to meet.

562
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm sorry.

563
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm sorry.

564
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
I'm sorry.

565
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
I'm sorry.

566
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
I'm sorry.

567
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,200
I just hope you can live a safe and happy life.

568
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Back to Yangzhou?

569
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
When did I say I was going back to Yangzhou?

570
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
You...

571
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
You don't have to feel guilty.

572
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
My face has nothing to do with you.

573
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Just like what you said,

574
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
I'm a big man.

575
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Even if I destroy Rong,

576
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
what can I do?

577
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
You don't have to worry about it.

578
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
You've really improved.

579
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Shangguan,

580
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
if you have nothing to do,

581
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
please go back.

582
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I'm tired.

583
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
I want to rest.

584
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Yang Yue,

585
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I really misjudged you.

586
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
If you really think so,

587
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I have nothing to say.

588
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
If you don't want me to feel guilty,

589
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
just rest well.

590
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm sorry.

591
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I'm sorry.

592
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm sorry.

593
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
I'm sorry.

594
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I'm sorry.

595
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
I'm sorry.

596
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm sorry.

597
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm sorry.

598
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm sorry.

599
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm sorry.

600
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
I'm sorry.

601
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm sorry.

602
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
I'm sorry.

603
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
I'm sorry.

605
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm...

606
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
I'm sorry.

608
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Brother Yang.

609
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,040
Who am I?

610
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,000
Lin He.

611
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,640
Xiao He.

612
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,280
Who is Lin Ling?

613
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,840
Your sister.

614
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,720
Why are you with your sister?

615
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,160
She wants to find your daughter.

616
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,720
I'll accompany her

617
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,560
to find that man.

618
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,080
But he's dead.

619
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,680
She'll go to Hangzhou with me

620
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,240
to find Yue and Xia.

621
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,360
Daughter?

622
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,880
Where is my daughter?

623
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,760
She's...

624
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,400
Where is she, Brother Yang?

625
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,600
Where is my daughter?

626
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,160
Tell me, Brother Yang.

627
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,000
No.

628
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,760
You're not Lin He.

629
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
You're not Xiao He.

630
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,240
I'm Lin He.

631
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,520
Brother Yang.

632
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm Lin He.

633
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
Tell me where my daughter is.

634
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,000
Xiao He.

635
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,520
Xiao He.

636
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Brother Yang.

637
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,240
Tell me where my daughter is.

638
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,880
No.

639
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,560
You're not Lin He.

640
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,000
Brother Yang.

641
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I'm Lin He.

642
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,480
You're not.

643
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,760
You're not.

644
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I'm Lin He.

645
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,600
You're not.

646
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,040
You're not.

647
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Tell me!

648
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,960
Nobody can know.

649
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,240
Nobody can tell.

650
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,680
Nobody can tell.

651
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,520
Nobody can.

652
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,640
Nobody can.

653
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,320
Bro...

654
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,960
Go.

655
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,280
Young Master.

656
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,840
What did you find out?

657
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,760
Yang Cheng Wan said

658
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
he and Lin Ling

659
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,680
went to find a criminal

660
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
to find out Lin and her whereabouts.

661
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,480
But when they found the criminal,

662
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,240
he was dead.

663
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,560
They came to Hangzhou

664
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,320
to find Yang Yue and Yuan Jin Xia.

665
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,360
Lin He's daughter?

666
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,800
I remember Xia Ran had a granddaughter

667
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,560
who disappeared at the night of the Yun Xiao Festival.

668
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,200
When the Xia family was executed,

669
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,760
they were not found.

670
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,200
What else did Yang Cheng Wan say?

671
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,400
He is strong-minded.

672
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,760
The shooting skill is limited to his function.

673
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,240
As long as he insists on

674
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,560
not telling the truth,

675
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,880
he won't tell the truth.

676
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,720
But as long as he tells the truth,

677
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
there won't be any falsehood.

678
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,160
Good.

679
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,400
It seems that

680
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,720
as long as I can find Lin He's daughter,

681
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,240
I can let Lin Ling

682
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,280
come to me willingly.

683
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,280
Young Master, let me go.

684
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,720
No.

685
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,440
Yan Feng.

686
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,320
Young Master.

687
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,600
Go find her.

688
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,960
Even if she's dead,

689
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,920
we need to find out where she is buried.

690
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,080
Yes.

691
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,320
Lord Lu.

692
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
I'm here to see you.

693
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,840
Greetings.

694
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,000
Lord Wu said

695
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,120
he wanted to talk with you.

696
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,480
But he didn't want you to see him in a bad mood.

697
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,640
He felt guilty.

698
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,680
He was worried that you would come from a long distance.

699
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,560
It's inconvenient to stay here every day.

700
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,240
So he sent some daily expenses.

701
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,040
Look.

702
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm sorry to tell you this.

703
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,720
We don't lack anything.

704
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,080
Send them back.

705
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,720
Lord.

706
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,280
Please take care of me.

707
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,360
Yes, Lord Lu.

708
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,480
Don't stop.

709
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,720
Qingyun Chupeng.

710
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,280
Don't go.

711
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm sorry.

712
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,080
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,440
Greetings, Lord Lu.

714
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,800
Lord Lu.

715
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,400
Lord Wu sent this to you.

716
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,080
Lord Lu.

717
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,400
I'll leave now.

718
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,960
You haven't agreed yet.

719
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,240
Why are you so proactive?

720
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,080
Since I've sent them here,

721
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,840
I'm already yours.

722
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,840
If you don't serve Lord well,

723
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,800
I'm afraid he'll feel uncomfortable.

724
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,560
Lord, leave it to me.

725
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,200
Leave it to me.

726
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,000
You go first.

727
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,840
Okay.

728
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,080
Sisters, please have some tea.

729
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
What's your name?

730
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,840
My surname is Yuan.

731
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,520
You can call me Yuan.

732
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,440
I'm a sweeper under Lord Lu's hands.

733
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,520
You're a sweeper.

734
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,360
Yes, yes.

735
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,440
I'm a sweeper.

736
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,840
I can't compare to you.

737
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,800
Look.

738
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,800
Sister Lianlian is famous.

739
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,960
I'm a sweeper.

740
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Sister Sisi's name is also nice.

741
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,400
What's the name of the world?

742
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,920
What's the name of the land?

743
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,320
You're so poetic.

744
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,680
I'm Yuan Jinxia.

745
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,520
I was born in the summer.

746
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,320
That's all.

747
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,920
I'm also a mosquito.

748
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,000
Sisters, please have some tea.

749
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,480
Sister, your clothes are so beautiful.

750
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,760
Look at the fabric.

751
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
It's smooth and soft.

752
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,360
The color is also bright.

753
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,960
Sisters, you're so beautiful.

754
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,040
What does Lord like to do?

755
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,480
Lord likes everything.

756
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,360
He only likes women.

757
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,240
I'm also very headache.

758
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,120
I'm afraid no girl likes him.

759
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,560
But he seems to like people who meet and talk.

760
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,560
If sisters can say more about

761
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,440
the death of your house,

762
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
our lord will like it.

763
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,400
Okay.

764
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,200
Okay.

765
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,480
Lord.

766
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,680
Wu Shouxu knew that he was trusted by the emperor.

767
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,880
I'm afraid he's not going to give you a gift.

768
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,600
Although the lord returned all the gifts he gave,

769
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,760
they still left these two girls.

770
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,920
Do you want to use some conspiracy

771
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,320
to make Wu Shouxu catch the target and threaten lord?

772
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,080
It's okay.

773
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,440
I know it.

774
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,400
I know.

775
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,200
I just feel uneasy.

776
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,440
After all, the court officials are suspicious of Wu Shouxu.

777
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,080
I know the purpose of Wu Shouxu.

778
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,080
You arrange a room for those two girls first.

779
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,440
Remember.

780
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,680
The room should be as far away as possible from this garden.

781
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,560
Yes.

782
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:51,880
And.

783
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,120
Bring Yuan Jinxia here.

784
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:55,920
Yes.

785
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,200
The fate is arranged.

786
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,360
Close your eyes.

787
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,440
I can see your face.

788
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,760
Open your eyes.

789
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,520
The back is full of gold.

790
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,480
The sword is full of sweet.

791
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,200
In the mortal world,

792
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,400
who has conquered the world?

793
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,520
No sound.

794
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,880
The sword rises and roars.

795
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,000
The fate turns.

796
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,440
It's a change of heart.

797
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,560
It's like parting.

798
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,400
It's too sad to part.

799
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,120
In the past,

800
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,000
I was so surprised.

801
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,960
The day I met you,

802
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,960
my hair turned white.

803
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,440
We spent years together.

804
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,440
In the dream,

805
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,640
we talked for a long time.
