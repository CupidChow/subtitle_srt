1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,720
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,640
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,640
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,640
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,640
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640

00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm sorry.

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,640
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,640
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm sorry.

32
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
I'm sorry.

33
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm sorry.

34
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm sorry.

35
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm sorry.

36
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
I'm sorry.

37
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm sorry.

38
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm sorry.

39
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm sorry.

40
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
I'm sorry.

41
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm sorry.

42
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm sorry.

43
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm sorry.

44
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
I'm sorry.

45
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm sorry.

46
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm sorry.

47
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
I'm sorry.

48
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm sorry.

49
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm sorry.

50
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm sorry.

51
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm sorry.

52
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm sorry.

53
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm sorry.

54
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
I'm sorry.

55
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm sorry.

56
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm sorry.

57
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm sorry.

58
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
I'm sorry.

59
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm sorry.

60
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm sorry.

61
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm sorry.

89
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry.

90
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
I'm sorry.

91
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,640
The horse can come alive by dying.

92
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
I'm interested.

93
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
I want to take her with me.

94
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm interested.

95
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Although the repair money has been found by Mr. Lu,

96
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
although the repair money has been found by Mr. Lu,

97
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
we still have to find the horse.

98
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
But she was originally from the Ministry of Works.

99
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
She has to return to her master.

100
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,640
She still has to return it to the Ministry of Works.

101
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Do you think this arrangement is reasonable?

102
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
It's reasonable.

103
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Sir.

104
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Also,

105
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
I like this little girl very much.

106
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
I want to stay by her side and do a good deed.

107
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm not going to do anything.

108
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
But,

109
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
for the sake of the loss of Lu Jingli today,

110
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
I won't let you cut it.

111
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Little girl,

112
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
you're injured.

113
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
That's good.

114
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
I have a high-grade gold-wound medicine in my dressing room.

115
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Just go to the dressing room with me to heal.

116
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
I can also talk to Lu Jingli.

117
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Okay.

118
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Lu Feng,

119
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
take her away.

120
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Yes.

121
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Lu Jingli,

122
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
come with me.

123
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
I've been waiting for you.

124
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Greetings, Sir Yan.

125
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm here.

126
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm here.

127
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
I'm here.

128
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
She's really beautiful

129
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
when she dresses up.

130
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Little girl,

131
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
if you want to look at my eyes,

132
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
you may as well take a look.

133
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Sir Yan,

134
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:45,040
she's just a small

135
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
girl.

136
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Sir Yan,

137
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
do you need anything?

138
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Take a look.

139
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
What can you see

140
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
from my appearance and dressing up today?

141
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Oh,

142
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
you can also take a look at my shoes.

143
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Sir Yan,

144
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
you see,

145
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
my legs are shaking.

146
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm afraid of something.

147
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
What else can I see?

148
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
I...

149
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
How dare I treat Sir Yan

150
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
as a criminal?

151
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
She,

152
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
you tell me.

153
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Don't refuse again.

154
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Come in.

155
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Let her see it carefully.

156
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
How is it?

157
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
What did you see?

158
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Sir,

159
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
this girl is good at finding out

160
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
that she has done

161
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
less than she should.

162
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
She may have done

163
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
something wrong

164
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
and been punished recently.

165
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
She may have turned the stove on

166
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,640
or smashed a precious tea bowl.

167
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
And,

168
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
the window in her warehouse

169
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
should be on the right side of the dressing table.

170
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
She's alive again.

171
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
She's alive again.

172
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
She's alive again.

173
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
She's alive again.

174
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
She's alive again.

175
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Or,

176
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
her right hand was injured.

177
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Then tell me,

178
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
how did you see it?

179
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Different things and different hands.

180
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
The scissors on the palm

181
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
and the scissors on the finger

182
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
are different.

183
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
It's like the old scissors

184
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,640
on the hands of the martial artists.

185
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Xiu Niang is good at making needlework.

186
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
So, her index finger

187
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
and the thumb's finger

188
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
will have a hard cut.

189
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
This girl's index finger

190
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
and thumb have no cut.

191
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
So,

192
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I think

193
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
she doesn't use needlework often.

194
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Then,

195
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
how did you find it?

196
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
I saw

197
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
the girl's sleeve was stained with water.

198
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Her hand was slightly red.

199
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
It's like a burn.

200
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Of course,

201
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
it may be

202
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
a burn on the hand of the craftsman.

203
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
So,

204
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I smelled her hand carefully.

205
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
There's a faint tea scent

206
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
on her hand.

207
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
There's no oil, star, green onion and garlic scent.

208
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Then,

209
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
how did you know

210
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
the window

211
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
is on the right side of the dressing table?

212
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
The hair on the right side

213
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
is more neat

214
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
than the left side.

215
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
During this season,

216
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
how often will this happen

217
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
when the sunlight is being used to dress up?

218
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
They dress up

219
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
with the sunlight.

220
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
I'm not sure about that.

221
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Manager Lu,

222
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
the six door business

223
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
is being held

224
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
in cooperation with the six door business.

225
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
There's a little girl

226
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
sitting beside you.

227
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm afraid that it's very interesting.

228
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Mr. Yan,

229
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
it's actually okay.

230
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Sometimes,

231
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
it's troublesome.

232
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Women

233
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
should be troublesome.

234
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
If it's not troublesome,

235
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
are you still a woman?

236
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Little girl,

237
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
sit down.

238
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Thank you, sir.

239
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm not used to

240
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
drinking wine from Yangzhou.

241
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
This time,

242
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
I brought some good wine

243
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
from the capital.

244
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
In Lu Jingli's B&B,

245
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
the one he often drinks is

246
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Qiu Lu Bai, right?

247
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Mr. Yan, you have a good memory.

248
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Little girl,

249
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
what about you?

250
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Oh, right.

251
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Yangcheng Wan is a guest.

252
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I'm sure that

253
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
he won't allow you

254
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
to drink outside.

255
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I...

256
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I'm not good at drinking.

257
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Please forgive me.

258
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
You're so...

259
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
These little girls

260
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
always say that

261
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
they're not good at drinking.

262
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
But in the end,

263
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
they can only be drunk

264
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,640
by two jars of wine.

265
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Mr. Yan,

266
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
you really make women believe you.

267
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Come in.

268
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Put Qiu Lu Bai on the table.

269
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Here.

270
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Here.

271
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Here.

272
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Here.

273
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Here.

274
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Here.

275
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Here.

276
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Here.

277
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Here.

278
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Here.

279
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Here.

280
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Here.

281
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Here.

282
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Here.

283
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Here.

284
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
He's so beautiful

285
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
that it's too luxurious.

286
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Little girl,

287
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
why did you lie just now?

288
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Was what I said the truth?

289
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Just now you said

290
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
the hair on his left,

291
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,600
No one on the right is right.

292
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
It's because

293
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,000
the dressing table is on the right side of the window.

294
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,800
But there's another reason

295
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
you didn't tell me.

296
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
Because

297
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,160
he's injured.

298
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
Although

299
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,880
you're still a young lady,

300
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,400
but as a subordinate of the Six Sages,

301
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,400
you must know

302
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,160
the joy of being in the house.

303
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,680
Well,

304
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,720
I'm sorry for my ignorance.

305
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,320
Please forgive me.

306
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
It's okay.

307
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,800
You're just a young lady.

308
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Actually, you're not young anymore.

309
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,680
You can have a taste of it.

310
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,320
My lord,

311
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,520
I have some work to do.

312
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,400
I'll leave now.

313
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,480
Please forgive me.

314
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,240
Maid.

315
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,480
Take this young lady to the guesthouse.

316
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,680
My lord, I...

317
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Shut up.

318
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
You're just a subordinate of the Six Sages.

319
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Can you do more work than me?

320
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,240
Don't talk about work in front of me.

321
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
Tonight,

322
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
you two can rest on my boat.

323
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,880
You can leave tomorrow morning.

324
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,360
Don't spoil my mood.

325
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,040
You're so kind.

326
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,520
Don't be so cold.

327
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Thank you, my lord.

328
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,840
I'll leave now.

329
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
You're just a young lady.

330
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
But you can still sit still.

331
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,520
You're longer than I expected.

332
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
I just let him be

333
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,640
for my sake.

334
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,360
Lord Yan,

335
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,440
you know that

336
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,040
his master Yang Cheng Wan

337
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,440
was my good subordinate

338
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,320
before he got injured.

339
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,800
I miss the old times.

340
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,280
Even this time,

341
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,720
I was especially ill.

342
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,560
A young lady like you

343
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
who hasn't grown up yet

344
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,640
and doesn't understand the world,

345
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't dare to be surprised.

346
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,560
Look at this place.

347
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,480
Which one is not better than her?

348
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,760
Manager Lu,

349
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,920
how about this?

350
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
You can pick one.

351
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,760
Don't be shy.

352
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,960
I promise

353
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,360
to let your favorite Pei Ni

354
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,480
stay with you tonight.

355
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,080
No need, Lord Yan.

356
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
These are all your favorite.

357
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,840
Besides,

358
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,160
my father is a strict teacher.

359
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm afraid he won't like it.

360
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,720
How can we push it to him?

361
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,560
lt's a pity

362
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,320
that those girls

363
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,920
can't be carried out using

364
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Lu Ting as customers.

365
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,160
However,

366
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,960
I promise

367
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,280
to take you to

368
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,120
your favorite Pei Ni tonight.

369
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,280
Please have a rest, Lord Lu.

370
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,400
I've arranged everything.

371
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,600
If you need anything,

372
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,840
just take off your collar.

373
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Dad!

374
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,360
Hurry!

375
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,480
Hush!

376
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,900
Mr. Yan!

377
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,260
Why are you here?

378
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,260
How do you feel for resize salt from here?

379
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,080
Перв upstairs.

380
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,060
Wait for me.

381
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,440
Is it confirmed?

382
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,480
It's said opiates are not怎麼辦 in this way.

383
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,900
The size of opiates leaves just two weeks.

384
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
I will give it a break then.

385
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,440
You're a bad girl.

386
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,780
First, why are you here?

387
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,980
Three months is too long to wait in here.

388
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,820
You should attend your technological examination in canton.

389
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,740
He said

390
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,140
he would let me have the one I like most.

391
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,900
Sir,

392
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,500
are you drunk?

393
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,460
Sir, what are you doing?

394
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,820
Sir, don't take it off.

395
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,780
What are you doing?

396
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,620
Sir.

397
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,380
Sir, Sir Lu.

398
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,340
Sir, you're drunk.

399
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,380
Sir, don't take it off.

400
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,180
Don't take it off.

401
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,300
Don't come over.

402
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,700
Sir, Sir Lu, don't.

403
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,380
What's going on?

404
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,460
You're drunk.

405
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,660
Sir Lu.

406
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,580
Sir Lu, help.

407
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,180
No, Sir Lu.

408
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,820
No, Sir Lu.

409
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,300
Lu Ye, you're a bastard.

410
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,180
When I have the strength,

411
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,340
I'll beat you to death.

412
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,540
Let me go.

413
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,300
You're a bastard.

414
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,140
Do you want to see?

415
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
Lu Ye.

416
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,700
You're a bastard.

417
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,740
Help.

418
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,260
Lu Ye.

419
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Help.

420
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,060
Help.

421
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,340
Lu Ye.

422
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,620
Don't stop.

423
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,540
Go on.

424
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,940
Someone is watching you.

425
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,900
Sir Lu.

426
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,340
Help.

427
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,900
You bastard.

428
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,340
Qin Shao, let me go.

429
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,420
These are all my fault.

430
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,060
These men.

431
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,100
They're all drunk.

432
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,260
I can't stand it.

433
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Don't touch me.

434
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Stop screaming.

435
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,620
They're all gone.

436
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Sir,

437
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,740
can you tell me in advance

438
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,260
if you want to act?

439
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,420
I'm so scared that my heart is about to explode.

440
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,420
Deng Tuzi,

441
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,660
Wei Junzi,

442
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,540
smelly man,

443
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Qin Shao.

444
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,020
You've told me the truth.

445
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,580
But Sir,

446
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,900
you looked like a bastard.

447
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,220
This is Yan Shi Fan's territory.

448
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,300
He can't hide from us.

449
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,180
If we try to avoid him,

450
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,020
he'll be suspicious.

451
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,020
You can't make fun of me for nothing.

452
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,980
Yan Shi Fan, this bastard.

453
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,060
Sir,

454
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,420
did he bully you?

455
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,940
I don't think

456
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,020
you're like him.

457
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,220
You're so stubborn.

458
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,340
Last time I was in the auction house in Beijing,

459
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,100
I saw him bully you.

460
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,900
This empty monkey

461
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,300
belongs to Sir Yan.

462
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Congratulations, Sir Yan.

463
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,380
I won't give it to you.

464
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,060
If you want to listen to the music,

465
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,060
I'll welcome you anytime.

466
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,380
At that time,

467
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,460
I thought you were a big head.

468
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,740
You spent 500 golds

469
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,540
to buy a toy.

470
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,900
Then I realized

471
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,500
that empty monkey

472
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,780
and the peach monster

473
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,300
must have some special meaning.

474
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,540
Tell me,

475
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,220
why did you play the peach monster?

476
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,100
Sir,

477
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,980
is it important?

478
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,820
How could he bully me?

479
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,420
I don't understand.

480
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,060
You don't need to understand many things.

481
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,140
I have to fulfill some of my feelings.

482
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,540
So,

483
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
I can only make you suffer.

484
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,260
Are you hungry?

485
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,140
Do you want them to bring some food?

486
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,700
No.

487
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,060
They'll eat in the dining room.

488
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,740
You've eaten all the soft gold powder.

489
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,060
What are you afraid of?

490
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,940
Tell me.

491
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,140
What do you want to eat?

492
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,140
Anything is fine.

493
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,460
I want to eat

494
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,460
the soft gold powder.

495
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,340
I want to eat the soft gold powder.

496
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
I want to eat the soft gold powder.

497
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,780
Anything is fine.

498
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,420
I want to eat noodles.

499
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,620
Beef noodles.

500
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,420
The food they made is really good.

501
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,260
Open your mouth.

502
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,620
Sir,

503
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,660
I can't.

504
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,580
You're a noble person.

505
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,340
How could you do this?

506
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,340
You can just leave it there.

507
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,060
I'll eat it when I have the energy.

508
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,820
Open your mouth.

509
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,740
It's an order.

510
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
How does it taste?

511
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
It's delicious.

512
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
It's delicious.

513
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,740
Here.

514
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,900
Since I was born,

515
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,060
my mother has never eaten for me.

516
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Thank you, sir.

517
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Here.

518
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Eat a piece of meat.

519
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
Thank you, sir.

520
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,460
On this boat,

521
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,460
in that person's place,

522
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
it's not a whole body

523
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,460
that makes people feel disgusted.

524
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
Xia'er.

525
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Put them down.

526
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Yes.

527
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,620
Xia'er,

528
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
you are...

529
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
Uncle Yang.

530
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
Uncle Yang,

531
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,060
you are Jinxia's master.

532
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,460
Jinxia's family is not here.

533
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,860
You are her elder.

534
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,460
I came here today

535
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,060
to marry Jinxia.

536
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,660
I hope you can allow me.

537
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
Xia'er,

538
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
don't stand on ceremony.

539
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,660
I can't do anything about this.

540
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,660
Jinxia's mother can't even take care of her.

541
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,860
It's useless for you to look for my father.

542
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
So,

543
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Jinxia can agree to it, right?

544
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
Xia'er,

545
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,860
you want to propose to Jinxia,

546
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
but I heard that

547
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,860
you and Xi'er have already made up your mind.

548
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
Uncle Yang,

549
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,860
my father forced me to do so.

550
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,860
I came here today

551
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
to prove

552
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
that it was a misunderstanding.

553
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Right, Senior Sister?

554
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Sister Shangguan.

555
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Xie Yuanyuan,

556
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
what are you doing?

557
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
Sir Lu,

558
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
I'm proposing to you.

559
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
To whom?

560
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
To you.

561
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Me?

562
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,860
You are a good girl and a gentleman.

563
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
I'm happy to marry you.

564
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,860
I want to marry you as my Young Master's wife.

565
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I'm sorry.

566
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
I'm sorry.

567
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
I'm sorry.

568
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
I'm sorry.

569
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Xie Yuanyuan,

570
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,860
I don't have time to spend time with you.

571
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
Come with me.

572
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
No, no.

573
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Jinxia.

574
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
If you don't believe me,

575
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
just leave me alone.

576
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
Let's see

577
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
how much you really love me.

578
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
This is the marriage certificate.

579
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,860
As long as you agree,

580
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
I can bring your mother here.

581
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
We can get married right away.

582
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,860
So much money?

583
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
It's just a part of it.

584
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
Besides,

585
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,860
you don't need to prepare for the wedding.

586
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
As long as you agree,

587
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
you can manage the account book of our family.

588
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
You are the one who should be married.

589
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
You can't get married just by saying so.

590
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Lu's people are so generous.

591
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Who are you?

592
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
If Jinxia misses this marriage,

593
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
can you afford it?

594
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
Xie Yuanyuan.

595
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
How do you know I can't afford it?

596
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
How do you know I can't afford it?

597
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,860
Jinxia.

598
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
I'll take you to see my father now.

599
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
He can't go with you.

600
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,860
Why?

601
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,860
He's not your family.

602
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
He is.

603
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
He's not your family.

604
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Do you believe that I'll marry him tomorrow?

605
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
Xixiu.

606
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,860
This marriage certificate

607
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
is a good thing.

608
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Right, master?

609
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,860
You can take these things back.

610
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,860
I'll think about it.

611
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,860
We'll discuss it another day.

612
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
Sir.

613
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,860
Jinxia, I'm here.

614
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
We'll discuss it another day.

615
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
Let's go.

616
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
I've brought all the marriage certificates.

617
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
I'll think about it.

618
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Sister Shenghe,

619
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
take good care of Xie Yuanyuan.

620
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
Don't let her go crazy again.

621
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Jinxia, I'll wait for you at home.

622
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Think about it, Jinxia.

623
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
I'll wait for you.

624
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,860
Master.

625
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
Jinxia.

626
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Jinxia.

627
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
Jinxia, open the door.

628
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
Jinxia, open the door.

629
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Listen to me.

630
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
Jinxia, open the door.

631
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,860
Open the door.

632
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,860
Jinxia, open the door.

633
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Open the door.

634
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Master.

635
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,860
I apologize for Jinxia today.

636
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,860
She's just a blind woman.

637
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,860
You're a big man.

638
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
Don't be so strict with her.

639
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Look, you're so angry.

640
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
God is crying.

641
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
You haven't married her yet.

642
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
You're in a hurry to talk about her.

643
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Master, don't make fun of me.

644
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Do you know about the thing about Xie Xiao and Shangguanxi?

645
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Yes.

646
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,860
But it's strange.

647
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
The thing about running away from marriage

648
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
is a big deal for a girl.

649
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,860
But I don't think Shangguanxi has any grudge against Xie Xiao.

650
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,860
That's because Xie Xiao saved her once.

651
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,860
They met in Gusu in that year.

652
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
The Wu'an Gang was still in the fight.

653
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
So they didn't have much people.

654
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,860
Xie Xiao could escape, but he stayed.

655
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,860
He faced the whole mountain village alone.

656
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,860
He must have saved Shangguanxi.

657
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
But he got hurt.

658
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
He died in the lake.

659
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,860
He was in the cave for half a year.

660
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
I see.

661
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,860
No wonder Shangguanxi is so nice to Xie Xiao.

662
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
He even helped her.

663
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
But it's okay.

664
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
You still have a chance.

665
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Okay.

666
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,860
If Jinxia misses this marriage,

667
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
will you be responsible?

668
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
How do you know I won't?

669
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Jinxia asked you to discuss the marriage with me, right?

670
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Wait.

671
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
You all leave.

672
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
I didn't provoke you.

673
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,860
Why do you come to me?

674
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
You already have Shangguanxi.

675
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Why do you still provoke Jinxia?

676
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,860
Jinxia is my sister.

677
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,860
I won't let her marry a heartless man like you.

678
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
How?

679
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,860
Three years ago, you ran away from the marriage.

680
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
Now you are angry with Shangguanxi.

681
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
It's so unfair.

682
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
Now you want to marry Jinxia.

683
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
Why do you treat these two women like this?

684
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,860
You don't know my sister at all.

685
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
She also opposed this marriage.

686
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,860
They were forced by the two elders.

687
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
She is my sister.

688
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
She is also the owner of the Hall of Blood.

689
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
I respect her and thank her.

690
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
This is the way it is.

691
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Jinxia is the one I want to marry.

692
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Shut up.

693
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
You ran away from the marriage.

694
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,860
And you give all the responsibility to Shangguanxi.

695
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,860
Why is there such a shameless person like you in this world?

696
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
And you want to marry Jinxia.

697
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,860
This marriage is the first one I don't agree.

698
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
You don't know what happened back then.

699
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Why should I tell you?

700
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,860
If you dare to stop me and Jinxia, I will kill you.

701
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
Stop.

702
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
You also like Jinxia, right?

703
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,860
So you come to me.

704
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,860
Nonsense.

705
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
You want to compete with women.

706
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,860
You should see your own weight.

707
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
I...

708
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
You are from the official family.

709
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Your father and the chief are old friends.

710
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,860
If he knows you fight for a woman like this, what will he think?

711
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,860
Enough, sister.

712
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
I am just playing with her.

713
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
It's not that serious.

714
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,860
There will be no next time.

715
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,860
I don't want to have another next time.

716
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
Jinxia.

717
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
I...

718
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,860
Isn't it my favorite?

719
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
M remain

720
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,180
You are

721
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,340
Cooked soup with bamboo shoots and mushrooms

722
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,420
Did you cook this

723
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,300
Correct

724
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,760
Andrew

725
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,840
mmm

726
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,360
fragrant

727
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,380
That's right

728
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,760
I'm going to use cooked lard to roll the radish

729
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,060
Are you going to roll the radish first?

730
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,780
If you really do that

731
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Then the dish can not be eaten

732
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
You're pregnant.

733
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
Dayang.

734
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
Enough. I understand.

735
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,860
Sit and rest.

736
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
Okay.

737
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
I've already woke up.

738
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Make spring cakes.

739
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
Okay.

740
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Brother.

741
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Jinxia, you want to make so many dishes.

742
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
What are you going to do?

743
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,860
I want to make a table of vegetarian dishes for Lord Lu.

744
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
For Lord Lu?

745
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
Oh, I almost forgot.

746
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I brought a letter of yours when I came.

747
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,860
My letter?

748
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Yes.

749
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
It's in my father's letter.

750
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,860
I guess your mother sent it to you.

751
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
This...

752
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,860
This is...

753
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,860
How many dowry did my mother make?

754
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,860
Why did the whole family agree so quickly?

755
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,860
It seems that this is a very good idea.

756
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,360
I guess you still remember the time when you helped him to beat the black

757
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,860
tigress.

758
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
I've already forgotten about that.

759
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,860
He wouldn't have made it so easily.

760
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
What easy way?

761
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
Lord, you're back.

762
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,860
Lord Lu.

763
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
I'll go back to work.

764
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,860
You two talk.

765
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,860
Okay.

766
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,860
Lord, you're back.

767
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
I'm going to make some dishes.

768
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Okay.

769
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Lord, you're back.

770
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,860
I'm going to buy you a meal.

771
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
Please sit down.

772
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Just these?

773
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
Yes.

774
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
I prepared a table of vegetarian dishes today.

775
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Lord, don't think that I'm saving money.

776
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I've checked the royal interest.

777
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
Today, I'll borrow a lot.

778
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
I also have 100,000 of merits.

779
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
What?

780
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,860
You think that I do too much evil things

781
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
and want me to get some merits?

782
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,860
No, no, no.

783
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
Lord, how can you say that?

784
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Please sit down.

785
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,860
I just want to get your blessings.

786
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,860
So, I should buy you a meal.

787
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
I heard that you've been happy recently.

788
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
Should I congratulate you?

789
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Lord, you heard it.

790
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
Don't laugh at me.

791
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Father, why don't you let me bring Jin Xia to see you?

792
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
I really want to marry Jin Xia.

793
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

794
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
You ran away from the wedding three years ago.

795
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,860
You want to marry Jin Xia three years later.

796
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,860
The Wu An Gang is a big gang in the pugilistic world.

797
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,860
You're the future leader of the Wu An Gang.

798
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,860
How can you be so ungrateful?

799
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
Lord.

800
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,860
Father, are you okay?

801
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
I'm fine.

802
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,860
By the way, the water station of the Dong family

803
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,860
has been active frequently in Yangzhou's port recently.

804
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,860
I think Dong Qisheng has a bad idea.

805
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Xiao'er, you should help Xi'er more.

806
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
She's alone and has to do magic.

807
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,860
Send more people to the port today.

808
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
Go to the port to check.

809
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,860
Make sure to keep our goods and goods safe.

810
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
Be careful.

811
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Dong Qisheng is behind the scenes.

812
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Okay.

813
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Lord, should we go to ask Doctor Shen?

814
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
Don't worry.

815
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Don't tell the people in the gang about my illness.

816
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Xie Xiao is very impulsive.

817
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,860
He never keeps a back door for himself.

818
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
I'm old.

819
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,860
He will take the responsibility of the gang.

820
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
But with his current state of mind,

821
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
I'm really worried.

822
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Lord, don't think too much.

823
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Xie Xiao is too childish.

824
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,860
I think we should give him more time to work out.

825
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,860
Lord, I think you should go to see the doctor.

826
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,860
Xi'er, go to the port to check.

827
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Xie Xiao just got in touch with the gang.

828
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
Everything is still unfamiliar.

829
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,860
Go to the port to check.

830
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,860
Here comes the food.

831
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
Please forgive me.

832
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Okay.

833
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,860
Spring cake.

834
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
I remember you said that

835
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,860
it was a good thing for you.

836
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,860
Marriage is a good thing.

837
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,860
I'll think about it.

838
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
We'll talk about it another day.

839
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,860
I just said it casually.

840
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,860
My family lives in the capital.

841
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,860
If I want to live so far away,

842
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,860
my mother won't agree.

843
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
Besides,

844
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
there is a sister Shangguan.

845
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,860
Xie Xiao had a engagement with her.

846
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
She loves her very much.

847
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
It's not good for me to be in the way.

848
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,860
If I marry her,

849
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I'll be in trouble.

850
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
She is so good at martial arts.

851
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,860
I can't even think about it.

852
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
I'm so worried.

853
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,860
You think too much.

854
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,860
I can't help it.

855
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
I won't agree to it.

856
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,860
My mother won't agree either.

857
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,860
I'll make her destroy this idea tomorrow.

858
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
Sir.

859
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,860
How about I make you a pot of wine?

860
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
You prepared wine?

861
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,860
When I was in your room that day,

862
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
I saw two jars in the corner.

863
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
They are still in the air.

864
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Would you like to try?

865
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,860
You invited me to dinner.

866
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
Why did you drink my wine?

867
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Well...

868
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
It doesn't matter who the wine belongs to.

869
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,860
What matters is that the wine is good.

870
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
You can eat and drink it.

871
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
Right?

872
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
I'll go to boil the wine now.

873
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,860
Okay.

874
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,860
Wait.

875
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,860
You can't use the wine to boil.

876
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
The wine is not yet fragrant.

877
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
You have to use a glass.

878
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
But...

879
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,860
Where can I find a glass for you?

880
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
There is no glass.

881
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
I won't drink.

882
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
I won't eat.

883
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
Sir.

884
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
Sit down.

885
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,860
I'll find you a glass.

886
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,860
Sir.

887
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
I found it.

888
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
I finally found a glass for you.

889
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Sir.

890
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,860
Sir.

891
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Try this.

892
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,860
This is the best dish in Dayang.

893
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,860
If I eat this,

894
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
I can eat three bowls of rice.

895
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,860
It's delicious.

896
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Is it delicious?

897
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Is this radish fried with lard?

898
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,860
Yes.

899
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Didn't you say you ate vegetarian food today?

900
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,860
Why do you use lard?

901
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,860
It's delicious.

902
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
What about the merit?

903
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
Don't think too much.

904
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
You are not lacking anyway.

905
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
This is really delicious.

906
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,860
Can't you just eat together?

907
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
Okay.

908
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
Eat together.

909
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Come on.

910
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,860
Sit down and eat together.

911
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,860
This...

912
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
This...

913
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
This is not appropriate.

914
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,860
We have different identities.

915
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
Sir, you eat first.

916
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
I'll serve you.

917
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
I'll eat after you finish eating.

918
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,860
Sit down.

919
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
Sit down and eat.

920
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,860
Sir, try this.

921
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,860
This is Dayang's best dish.

922
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,860
I'll make one for you.

923
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Can you eat this?

924
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
It's delicious.

925
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,860
Sir, try it.

926
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,860
It tastes a little strange.

927
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Sir,

928
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,860
can you smell the taste of the firewood?

929
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
That's it.

930
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Sir, you are not good at this.

931
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,860
This firewood

932
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,860
is the most important part of the spring cake.

933
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Maybe this is

934
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,860
a southern habit.

935
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,860
So sir, you can't eat it.

936
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Southern habit?

937
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,860
He lived in Fujian when he was a kid.

938
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Dayang's cooking

939
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,860
tastes a little southern.

940
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,860
They don't care about this spring cake.

941
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
It's called a cake.

942
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,860
It will taste better

943
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
when you get used to it.

944
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,860
Yang Putou is obviously from Jiangxi.

945
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,860
Why did he live in Fujian for so many years when he was a kid?

946
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,860
The rain falls, I'm lost

947
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,860
in my thoughts

948
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,860
The wind blows, I'm shocked

949
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,860
My heart is blank

950
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Thousands of miles of ambush

951
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,860
Who is out of the mountain

952
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,860
Can't beat the fate

953
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,860
I close my eyes, I look at the sky

954
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,860
I can see your face

955
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,860
Open your eyes, the back is dark

956
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,860
The sword is full of sky

957
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:48,860
Who has conquered the world

958
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:54,860
No sound, the sword is silent

959
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,860
The fate turns

960
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,860
See the change in the world

961
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,860
Like parting, parting is too sad

962
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:13,860
There is a piece of gold

963
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,860
The day I met you

964
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,860
White hair in the sky

965
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,860
Passed all the years

966
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,860
See you again

967
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,860
The Long Ballad

968
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,860
