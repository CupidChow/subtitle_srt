It's inconvenient for you to go out and do things.

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,920
I asked you to change your clothes and not go to the official office.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm afraid that the local officials will disturb you.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
It will affect our secret investigation in Hangzhou.

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Then why are you here now?

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Didn't you say that you know the girl's mind the most?

61
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,440
What?

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,640
You didn't even see that

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
Min'er has fallen in love with you.

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,560
Fall in love?

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
Although I saved her life,

66
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,720
she didn't want to marry me.

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,600
Even if she treats me as a man,

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,520
I don't like the way

69
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,600
her family is so generous.

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,240
Since she met you,

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,040
her eyes have never been transferred from you.

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
You'd better find a chance

73
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,880
to explain to her.

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Otherwise, it will be more troublesome in the future.

75
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,560
How can I know that she is looking at me

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,880
if you don't look at her?

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,840
I think you care about Miss Min very much.

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,600
That's why you understand so much

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,920
from her eyes.

80
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,480
Just do as I said.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,440
What's going on between you and Lu Daren?

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you mean?

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,560
Nothing.

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,000
You said nothing?

85
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,680
Since you two were chatting,

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
I saw you walking around here.

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Why did he bully you?

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,040
No.

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,440
Why would he bully me?

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,840
We were talking about Chunyu.

91
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,080
Yes.

92
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Shangguan told me about it.

93
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,080
What are you going to do?

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
I...

95
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
I'll go to Yuan's Mansion.

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,200
I'll go to Yuan's Mansion.

97
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,240
I'll go to Yuan's Mansion.

98
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,320
I'll go to Yuan's Mansion.

99
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,360
I'll go to Yuan's Mansion.

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
Brother Yuan.

101
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,840
You're so noisy.

102
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,920
Miss Cheng Yu.

103
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,480
Brother Yuan.

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,440
I have something to tell you.

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,760
I'll go first.

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,760
You two talk.

107
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,440
Don't walk so fast.

108
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,040
Don't move.

109
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,560
Miss Cheng Yu, what's up?

110
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,680
Last time you saved me.

111
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,640
This time you saved me again.

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,600
I...

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,600
I really don't know how to repay you.

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,200
Miss Cheng Yu, you're welcome.

115
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm not the only one who saved you.

116
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,680
It's different.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Brother Yuan is different from others in my heart.

118
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,800
Oh no.

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,240
Actually...

120
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Actually, I have something...

121
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
This is the pouch I made these days.

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,280
It's for you.

123
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,080
What rubbish.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,520
Qu honeymoon?

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm screwed up.

126
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,040
Brother Yuan is not a particular person.

127
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm a lady.

128
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,640
I have to bring maidservants with me.

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
It's inevitable to be a little bit of a friend.

130
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm afraid...

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,920
You're afraid that Mr. Yuan won't like it, right?

132
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,480
You're getting more and more unruly.

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,840
Miss, have you sent your pouch out?

134
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,160
I just don't know if he knows what I mean

135
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,640
when he sees the sick earth forest on the pouch.

136
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Miss, you're very kind to Mr. Yuan.

137
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,080
As long as he's not stupid,

138
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,080
he'll give you an answer.

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,480
Who is it?

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,200
Mr. Yuan.

141
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,960
Miss Chunyu.

142
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,600
Miss Chunyu.

143
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
Mr. Yuan, please come in.

144
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
Miss, I'll make tea for you.

145
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,880
Mr. Yuan, please sit down.

146
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
I won't sit down.

147
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Miss Chunyu.

148
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you for your pouch.

149
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,120
But it's not suitable for me.

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
You don't like flowers?

151
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
No, pouches are very good.

152
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,320
This pouch is made of good quality.

153
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,120
It's not that I don't like this pouch.

154
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,160
It's just that I don't like the person who made this pouch.

155
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,240
I don't like the person who made this pouch.

156
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,080
Although I'm the emperor,

157
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm afraid that I'll be disrespected

158
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,600
if I don't take care of my family one day.

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,760
So I deliberately married my brother

160
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,200
to be close to my family.

161
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,040
But I know that

162
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm not worthy of the head of the family

163
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
with my family character.

164
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
Even if I marry him,

165
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,200
I can only be a concubine.

166
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
Moreover,

167
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,120
now...

168
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,760
Now I only have Yuan in my heart.

169
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
If Yuan dislikes me, I...

170
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,800
No, no, no.

171
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Miss Chunyu, it's not that.

172
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
You're a lady of the Gui family.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
You have no right to dislike me.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,960
It's me.

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
I'm not worthy of the head of the family.

176
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
Are you afraid that your parents won't agree?

177
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,280
They've been loving me since I was a child.

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
I went to beg them

179
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,240
and asked my eldest brother to make it clear for me.

180
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,840
They will definitely agree.

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,400
No.

182
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,640
It's impossible for us to be together.

183
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
It's impossible for this life.

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
I'm not your good friend.

185
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,400
You should make it a secret.

186
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
Why not?

187
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
If you really care about me,

188
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
we can elope.

189
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,480
As long as you have me in your heart,

190
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
I'll be with you forever.

191
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm not afraid of that.

192
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
You really want to know the reason?

193
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
Go tell her I'm your daughter.

194
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
You...

195
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,800
Impossible.

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
Impossible.

197
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,640
Impossible.

198
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,160
Although it's not my intention,

200
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,240
it's my fault.

201
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
But I didn't expect you to...

202
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,120
Enough!

203
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,160
My lady, what's wrong with you?

204
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,560
My lady.

205
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
If you can get rid of your anger,

206
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
just hit me.

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,400
I promise I won't avoid it.

208
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,080
My lady.

209
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,720
My lady.

210
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Why? Why did you lie to me?

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,560
Why did you lie to me?

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
Mr. Yuan.

213
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,480
No.

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
Miss Yuan.

215
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
You should leave.

216
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,720
My lady.

217
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
What...

218
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
What's going on?

219
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
Why did Mr. Yuan

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
become Miss Yuan?

221
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,000
Traitor!

222
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,160
My lord,

223
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
Troubles!

224
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,400
All wrong, all wrong.

225
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm calm, I'm chill.

226
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Here.

227
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm unwell.

228
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,240
My dream.

229
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,080
My dream.

230
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
My dream.

231
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,580
His Highness is so kind to this vermin.

232
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,240
I am your father

233
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Do you feel wronged?

234
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
No

235
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,680
I deserve it

236
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Of course

237
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
It's not appropriate

238
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I'll go back first

239
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
and wash it

240
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
It turns out that adults also have such a gentle side

241
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
It's almost the end of the seventh quarter

242
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I have ordered Mrs. Liu

243
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
to call the best tailor in the city

244
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
to make you a dress

245
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
and make you some new clothes

246
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
By the way

247
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
the head-dressing and the jewelry

248
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
should be remade

249
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Miner

250
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Miner

251
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Yes, mother

252
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Aunt

253
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Ye

254
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Mrs. Li

255
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Ye

256
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Mrs. Li

257
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,800
This is Mr. Yuan

258
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Yes

259
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Why are you dressed as a woman?

260
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Aunt

261
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Jinxia has always been a woman

262
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
She is the subordinate of the Six Hills Sect

263
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
She helped me to come out to handle the case

264
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
In order to make it convenient

265
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
she has been dressed as a man

266
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I see

267
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Come here and let me see

268
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
She is a beauty

269
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
But

270
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
girls like to be beautiful

271
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
You made her wear a red dress

272
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Well

273
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
It's really

274
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
wronged her

275
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
No, it's not wronged

276
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
I deserve it

277
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
It's the seventh quarter soon

278
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm talking about making Miner some new clothes

279
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
It's a good time

280
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Yuanyang

281
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Why don't you make it with Miss Yuan?

282
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
No, no, no

283
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
I can't, madam

284
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I can't do it without credit

285
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Besides

286
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm busy with official affairs

287
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I haven't had a good time for a long time

288
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I don't need to wear this new dress

289
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
You are the savior of Miner

290
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
You can't afford to

291
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
wear a few clothes

292
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
It's a good time

293
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
for a woman to seek a marriage

294
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
How can you be so careless?

295
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Besides

296
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
there is also a flower-picking party

297
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
What is this flower-picking party?

298
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
You may not know it

299
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Every three years

300
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
there will be a flower-picking party in Hangzhou

301
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
The most beautiful and clever woman will be selected

302
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
She will dance on the water

303
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
The painter will draw her dance

304
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
on the walking horse on the river

305
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
to impress the workers

306
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
The chosen woman

307
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
will be the one

308
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
everyone wants to marry

309
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Well

310
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
It's a good time

311
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
for the bride and groom to get blessings

312
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Yes

313
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
So

314
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
the new dress is a must

315
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Since you are so kind

316
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I have to follow your order

317
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Thank you, madam

318
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Great

319
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Great

320
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Sir

321
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Are you going to the flower-picking party?

322
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Since I am in Hangzhou

323
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I will go to see what's going on

324
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
What about the investigation?

325
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
I will do what I should do

326
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
But

327
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I can't tell you about it

328
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I have asked the chief of Shangguan

329
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
He will send people from Wuan Gang

330
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
to investigate

331
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Is there anything unusual?

332
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Sir

333
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
What are you talking about?

334
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
It's just a business

335
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I envy you so much

336
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
You can be with him

337
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Unlike me

338
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
A girl who hasn't left the house

339
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
can only stay at home every day

340
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
It's rare to see her

341
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Yes

342
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
You are really different from him

343
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I remember

344
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
When the New Year was over

345
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
my brother would come to see me

346
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
and give me a gift

347
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Once

348
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
you gave me your personal waistband

349
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I have been keeping it

350
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I won't disturb you

351
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
and Miss Min

352
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I will leave now

353
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Enough

354
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Does my brother know?

355
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
He told me

356
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Min'er was wrong

357
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Since my brother knows

358
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
he should know

359
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
how much insult

360
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
this is to a girl

361
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
How can I swallow this?

362
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
He has always been like this

363
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
He didn't mean to lie to you

364
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Actually

365
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I started this

366
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
If you have to blame me

367
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
blame me

368
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I have never seen my brother

369
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
so greedy

370
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Although he didn't do it on purpose

371
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
he has the right to hide

372
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
He knew my intention

373
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
and didn't tell me on purpose

374
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
He must want to laugh at me

375
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Min'er is a man

376
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
He is not good

377
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
but Yuan Jinxia

378
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
came to pinch me

379
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
and embarrassed me

380
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Min'er suffered so much

381
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
and made others think he is a monkey

382
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Brother

383
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
don't you care about it?

384
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Miss Yuan

385
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
You want to see me?

386
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
You want to see me?

387
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
My lady is kind

388
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
I don't have the courage to tell you

389
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
As a maid

390
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
I have to say something for my lady

391
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Just say it

392
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
My lady made a mistake

393
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
in the past

394
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
so I made a lot of mistakes

395
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
But now I know

396
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
my lady has lost her memory

397
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
After she woke up

398
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
she thought she really cared about

399
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Young Master Biao

400
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Lord Lu

401
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Master intended to

402
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
make a match between

403
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
my lady and Young Master Biao

404
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
My lady told you

405
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
she didn't want to be a concubine

406
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
But the times are different

407
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
My lady has figured it out

408
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
It's not impossible

409
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
to marry Young Master Biao

410
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
even as a concubine

411
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
My lady didn't think so before

412
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Now she has

413
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
As a maid

414
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
I have to see Young Master Biao

415
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
as a future master

416
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Although Miss Yuan

417
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
works for Young Master Biao

418
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
she is a girl

419
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
A man may not be considerate

420
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Even if you don't mind

421
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
the gossip

422
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
and don't know how to avoid it

423
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
But my lady

424
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
or our Chunyu Mansion

425
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
doesn't want others

426
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
to misunderstand

427
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Young Master Biao's reputation

428
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
They think she has made a mistake

429
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I have heard

430
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
all the words of Miss Yuan Yang

431
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
It's good that you can hear it

432
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
You said your lady

433
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
was sad because of me

434
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
so she decided to marry Lord Lu

435
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
It's just a day's difference

436
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
She is so quick to

437
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
turn her head

438
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Are you sure she is sincere

439
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
to Lord Lu?

440
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
And she would rather

441
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
be a concubine than marry Lord Lu

442
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Do you know about it?

443
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Have you agreed?

444
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
As long as

445
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
both parents can make a decision

446
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
I will agree

447
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
That means

448
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
our lord never agreed

449
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
So we don't know

450
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
whether this marriage will work

451
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Besides

452
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Lord Lu and I are colleagues

453
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
We work for the court together

454
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
But the small man and woman's relationship

455
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
is worse than

456
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
the family affairs

457
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Miss Yuan used the family affairs

458
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
to suppress me

459
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
She deliberately

460
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
made it difficult for me

461
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
You came to me first

462
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
I just followed your words

463
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
and made a little

464
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
confusion

465
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Besides

466
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
think about it

467
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
The man hasn't married

468
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
the woman hasn't married

469
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Even if I have something

470
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
with the lord

471
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
as long as both parties are willing

472
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
it has nothing to do with the outsiders

473
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
You are a lady

474
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
You can say such shameless words

475
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I know you are a kind lady

476
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
I know your lady

477
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
very well

478
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I am very loyal to you

479
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I don't want to

480
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
be angry with you

481
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
even if I am a maid

482
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
But

483
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
don't bully me

484
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
I am very stubborn

485
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
I can't stand it

486
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
for a while

487
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Don't come to me in the future

488
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Aren't you afraid that

489
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
my lady will tell

490
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
these words to the young master?

491
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
It doesn't matter

492
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I said the same thing

493
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
in front of the lord

494
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
As long as you don't mind

495
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I will be polite

496
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
As long as you don't mind

497
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I will be polite

498
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I will be polite

499
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I am very willing

500
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
to tell these words

501
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
in front of the lord

502
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
in front of the lord

503
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Wait

504
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Yuan Jinxia

505
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
You are really a scoundrel

506
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Why are you

507
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
looking for a little girl?

508
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
You are so annoying

509
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Yes

510
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
You are really different from her

511
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
She is a lady

512
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
who can't be

513
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
seen by the lord

514
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I am a little

515
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
fish-catching little fish

516
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I am really different

517
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
What do you mean?

518
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Mi Er

519
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I just want

520
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
my brother to recognize this person

521
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
In my opinion

522
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
He has other thoughts

523
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
about you

524
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
He is really

525
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
too good at confusing people

526
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I don't want my brother

527
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
to be fooled by others like me

528
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
You should be more careful

529
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Since my mother died

530
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I have never been to Hangzhou

531
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Maybe my cousin

532
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
hasn't seen me for years

533
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
and doesn't know my mood

534
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
These years

535
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I have been a guard

536
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
and have seen too many criminals

537
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I have really

538
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
improved my ability to see people

539
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
I can see the truth and the false

540
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
and the real and the fake

541
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
As long as I pay attention

542
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
I can see

543
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
everything

544
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I know very well

545
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
what kind of person she is

546
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
In her mood

547
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
you are on the same page today

548
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
She will never

549
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
take revenge in a hostile way

550
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
She is not

551
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
an ordinary daughter

552
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
So I say

553
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
You are different from her

554
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Cousin

555
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
You don't have to

556
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
pretend to be smart

557
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
in front of me

558
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Does Mi Er

559
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
look down on you?

560
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I am telling the truth

561
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Brother, you don't believe me?

562
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I believe in one thing

563
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
She is the best at

564
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
fooling people

565
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Sister

566
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Why did Lu

567
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
ask you to help her?

568
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
He is an official

569
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I am a civilian

570
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
I can refuse

571
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
She has so many guards

572
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Why does she need me

573
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
to help her?

574
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Lord Lu said

575
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
it is not good

576
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
for officials to talk about this

577
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Anyway, I have never

578
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
seen such a

579
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
thick-skinned person

580
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
If it weren't for Jin Xia

581
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I wouldn't want to

582
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
see her

583
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
How many times have I told you?

584
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
She is an official

585
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
You should

586
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
pay attention to what you say

587
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
In the future, you will take over

588
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Wu An Gang

589
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
so that you won't have to

590
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
deal with the officials

591
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
You can't do this

592
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Someone surrounded the entrance

593
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
of Wu An Gang

594
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Really?

595
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
What happened?

596
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
I don't know

597
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Over there

598
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Over there

599
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Let's go and have a look

600
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Let's go and have a look

601
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Murderer, don't kill me

602
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Please go

603
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Please don't cry

604
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Go back

605
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Blood is spilling

606
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Murderer, don't kill me

607
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Blood is spilling

608
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
You go first

609
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Blood is spilling

610
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Go back

611
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Yes

612
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Under the bright sun

613
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
of Wu An Gang

614
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
they bully the people

615
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Don't you think it is reasonable?

616
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Yes

617
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Why did you drive them away?

618
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Let him make it clear

619
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Don't worry

620
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Let's talk about it later

621
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
My master

622
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
and his business team

623
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
went to Yangzhou

624
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
They were afraid of

625
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
meeting the pirates

626
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
so they invited

627
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
the people of Wu An Gang

628
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
to help them with the delivery of the goods

629
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Who knew

630
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
they would meet them?

631
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
The people of Wu An Gang told me

632
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
that my master and his business team

633
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
were all dead

634
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
But the day before yesterday

635
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
my master came back

636
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Yes

637
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
He was all dead

638
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Yes

639
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
He came back

640
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
with his last breath

641
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
It's terrible

642
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
He wanted to tell us

643
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
the truth about our marriage

644
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
What truth?

645
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
What truth?

646
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Tell us

647
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
What truth?

648
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
The truth is

649
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
there were no pirates at all

650
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
It's you

651
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
the people of Wu An Gang

652
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
who killed all the people

653
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
in the business team

654
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,800
and took all the property

655
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Nonsense

656
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
The people of Wu An Gang killed all the people

657
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
You should pay back

658
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
your life

659
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
What?

660
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
What?

661
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Be quiet

662
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Master Shangguan

663
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I'm the master

664
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
of the people of Wu An Gang

665
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
If this really happened

666
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
I will not let it go

667
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Wu Xi

668
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Aunt

669
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
If what you said

670
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
why didn't you report it?

671
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Report it?

672
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
It's useless to report it

673
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
after death

674
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
If you don't report it

675
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
I will report it

676
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
You report it

677
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Who knows if you have

678
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
colluded with the government

679
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
and want to end it

680
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Yes

681
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
May I ask

682
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
where is his body?

683
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
My father died so badly

684
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Do you want him

685
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
to be exposed to the wildness?

686
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
We buried him long ago

687
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Buried

688
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I can't explain it

689
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
The so-called truth

690
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
in your mouth

691
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
is all from the dead

692
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
If you can't see this body

693
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
who can be sure

694
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
that he was alive

695
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
You

696
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
You

697
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
I have an idea

698
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Otherwise

699
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
we invite the officer

700
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
to let the coroner open the coffin

701
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
After we confirm

702
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
your father's identity

703
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
we can talk about the rest

704
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
No justice

705
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
No justice

706
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
I am innocent

707
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I have to settle this matter

708
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I just don't want to be a daughter-in-law

709
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
No justice

710
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I am innocent

711
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
If your father is really innocent

712
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I will be innocent for him

713
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
He will not blame you

714
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
You go to the yard and ask him

715
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Yes

716
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
You are going to close the door

717
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Do you want him to be alive?

718
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Yes

719
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Do you want him to be alive?

720
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Yes

721
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Do you want him to be alive?

722
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I hate you

723
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
You have to tell him

724
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Look

725
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
The teacher doesn't allow people to be alive

726
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Why do you make people live?

727
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Go back

728
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Go back

729
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Go back

730
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Go back

731
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Go back

732
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
You stay here

733
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I will go here

734
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Ok

735
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Go back

736
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Go back

737
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Don't beat people

738
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Go back

739
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Stop

740
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Hurry up

741
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Go back

742
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Shangguan Xiyang Yue

743
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Thank you, Wu An Gang

744
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
One day

745
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I will make you pay back what you owe me

746
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
The debtor is in great trouble

747
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Now he has a lead

748
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
He is going to beat the boss

749
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,800
The revenge of our Dong family will be paid sooner or later

750
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,800
I will not let go of these people

751
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
But

752
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,800
I am afraid that we should take the blame for framing the Wu An Gang

753
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
It doesn't matter

754
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,800
We are here to help you

755
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Besides

756
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
The boss asked us to catch Yuan Jinxia

757
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Are you sure that she is in Chunyu's mansion?

758
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Yes

759
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
She and Lu Yi are both here

760
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
It's a little troublesome

761
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
It seems that we have to think of another way

762
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Miss

763
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I went to see Miss Yuan in the daytime

764
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
She was very arrogant

765
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
She was wrong

766
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
But she was so arrogant

767
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
She didn't take you seriously because of the support of Young Master

768
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
She also said

769
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
What did she say?

770
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
She said that men are not married and women are not married

771
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Even if she has something with Young Master

772
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Miss

773
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
You are an outsider

774
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
You don't have the right to blame yourself

775
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Outsider

776
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
I want to show her who is an outsider

777
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
You mean

778
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
I must marry into the Lu family

779
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I must marry into the Lu family

780
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
After the funeral

781
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
I will discuss with my father

782
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Let him plan for me

783
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Young Master's personality

784
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Doesn't look like he will spoil people

785
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm afraid he won't be happy

786
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
It doesn't matter if he is good to me or not

787
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,800
As long as I marry my brother

788
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
It's the best revenge for him

789
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Yesterday

790
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
The Wu An Gang was framed

791
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
It's interesting

792
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
What interesting?

793
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Sir Lu

794
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
You are trying to see the Wu An Gang's popularity, right?

795
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Xie Xiao

796
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Don't be rude

797
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
It's okay

798
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Young Master Xie's temper

799
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm used to it

800
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
In addition

801
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
I was chasing after this pair of mother and son

802
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
A group of people rushed out to stop

803
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
They were all wearing jade

804
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
These people are very good at fighting

805
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
They have different martial arts skills

806
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Some of them are not like the people of the Central Plains

807
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Sir

808
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Are these people the pirates?

809
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
If it's really them

810
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Then this Hangzhou trip is a good start

811
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Pirates?

812
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,800
They obviously came for the Wu An Gang

813
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
If they are really pirates

814
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,800
What grudge do they have with our Wu An Gang?

815
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,800
There must be a reason behind doing this

816
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Eyes bright

817
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
In the future

818
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:37,700
The new generation of the particular Black

819
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
ICA

820
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Prince

821
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,940
Why did you come suddenly without informing me

822
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,240
I was too late to receive it.

823
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,640
I was afraid that I would be late.

824
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,760
Get up.

825
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,960
I didn't blame you.

826
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,800
Don't blame yourself.

827
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,800
I asked you to get up but you didn't.

828
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,480
It seems that something is wrong.

829
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
I failed to complete the task you assigned.

830
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,120
I was too guilty.

831
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,920
Please punish me.

832
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I know this.

833
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,800
Yan Feng said that you were injured because of this.

834
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
It's just a small injury.

835
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
It's nothing serious.

836
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I like smart and obedient women.

837
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,320
Yes.

838
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,640
I'm sorry.

839
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,400
Lin Ling is the one I want.

840
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,920
You'd better not have other thoughts.

841
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,000
I understand.

842
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,720
Get up.

843
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
Don't worry about Lin Ling.

844
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,440
I have other things to ask you to do.

845
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,400
Come on.

846
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,600
Danyang.

847
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,640
Did something happen between you and Sister Shangguan?

848
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,800
Since you came to Hangzhou,

849
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,520
I've been thinking that you two are strange.

850
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,840
Nothing.

851
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,200
What's the matter between her and me?

852
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,920
Nothing.

853
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Don't be scared.

854
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,640
You think it's my first day to meet you.

855
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
I told you it's nothing.

856
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,280
Hurry up.

857
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,080
Come on.

858
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,600
Come on.

859
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,880
The best hairpin.

860
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,960
Come and buy a hairpin.

861
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Come on.

862
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,520
Boss.

863
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,400
Are all the houses in Hangzhou so rare?

864
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,600
That's not a normal house.

865
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,400
This is the famous business share of our Hangzhou city.

866
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,760
Half of the salt in the city is from Sima's mansion.

867
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Salt business?

868
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,320
No wonder.

869
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,240
Right?

870
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,960
It's almost the seventh day of the lunar festival.

871
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,200
The silk flower party that will be held that day

872
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,480
is held by the boss of Sima,

873
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,920
the owner of the silk flower.

874
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,280
Silk flower?

875
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,600
If someone marries him,

876
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,400
he'll be blessed.

877
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,760
If you say that,

878
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,440
it's really a good thing.

879
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,920
The boss of Sima is good in everything.

880
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But there's one thing.

881
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,760
Your face is ugly.

882
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,040
So you wear a mask all the time.

883
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,120
No one has ever seen his real face.

884
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,960
That's a pity.

885
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,120
He's also a hard worker.

886
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,280
He married two wives in three years.

887
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,640
Almost every one of them

888
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,080
died in an accident when they entered the house.

889
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,240
Now someone is spreading the rumor that he's a guest wife.

890
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,720
It's a hard life.

891
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,240
It's a pity that there's no silk flower and no silver.

892
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
You're right.

893
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,640
Miss, why don't you take a look at my hairpin?

894
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,520
The girl who bought hairpins

895
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,840
will be very beautiful

896
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,800
if she comes to the silk flower party.

897
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
In this case,

898
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,000
the girl who came to propose

899
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,520
will definitely break your family's threshold.

900
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,200
Boss, you're so good at business.

901
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,400
Every girl buys hairpins in your family.

902
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,880
Everyone can get a good hairpin.

903
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
You're so good.

904
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,680
I wonder if you have a favorite girl.

905
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,600
Don't look at my hairpin.

906
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,120
It's simple.

907
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,320
But it's not inferior to any hand-made

908
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
jewelry store.

909
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,720
It can help you win the girl's heart.

910
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,760
What should I do?

911
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,360
You have a good eye.

912
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,360
This is my treasure.

913
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,480
Since you're meant to be together,

914
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,440
I'll give you two taels of silver.

915
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,400
Two taels?

916
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,680
Are you kidding me?

917
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm a good worker.

918
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
I thought you'd say more.

919
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,200
But I didn't expect you to say two taels.

920
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,400
It's already cheap.

921
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,160
You're a man.

922
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,680
Two...

923
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,040
That's all I have.

924
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,200
Is that enough?

925
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Well...

926
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Okay.

927
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,040
Take it.

928
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,960
Thank you.

929
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,120
I'll sell it to you.

930
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,120
Is it beautiful?

931
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,280
Yes.

932
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,680
Thank you.

933
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,360
You're welcome.

934
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,040
See you.

935
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,680
Jinxia.

936
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,440
Jinxia.

937
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,360
Come on.

938
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,200
The best hairpin.

939
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,760
Yang Yue.

940
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,400
You want to see me?

941
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,360
Yes.

942
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,560
What's up?

943
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,360
The flowering festival is in a few days.

944
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Jinxia will go.

945
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,600
She asked me to invite you.

946
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
This hairpin is...

947
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,360
It's...

948
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,840
It's for you.

949
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,840
Thank you.

950
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,720
Thank you.

951
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,880
Thank you.

952
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,360
Thank you.

953
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,000
Thank her on my behalf.

954
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,960
Okay.

955
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,020
Bad luck.

956
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Miss Yuan, do you have any leftover food?

957
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Yes. What do you want to eat?

958
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Anything is fine. As long as I can fill my stomach.

959
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Okay. Then go back to your room and rest.

960
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,120
I'll send it to you later.

961
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Thank you, Miss.

962
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Wait.

963
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,120
What did Miss Yuan want to do with you?

964
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,120
She said she was hungry and wanted to find something to eat.

965
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,120
What good thing is that? Look how happy you are.

966
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,120
Miss, this time I helped you get rid of your hunger.

967
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,120
You little brat, what trouble did you cause me?

968
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,120
I just passed by the corridor and saw Miss Yuan go to the kitchen to get food.

969
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
So I told the maid in the fire room

970
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,120
to let her go to Second Young Master's room

971
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,120
and send her that bottle of fruit wine.

972
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Miss, I'll go with you.

973
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,120
I'll go with you.

974
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,120
I'll go with you.

975
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
I'll go with you.

976
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Ask her to come to Second Young Master's room and say this.

977
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
One, two.

978
00:39:44,120 --> 00:40:03,080
The second

979
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,040
One, two.

980
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,120
Miss, the wine is extremely fresh.

981
00:40:37,120 --> 00:41:02,180
The

982
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,540
You!

983
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,380
I finally hurt you.

984
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,220
You should buy me a round one.

985
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,980
A round one!

986
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,500
Sir.

987
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,420
It's such a high roof.

988
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,460
How did you get up?

989
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,060
You think I can't get up without you?

990
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,700
You're not good at light.

991
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,340
You're drunk.

992
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,820
And you're late to the room.

993
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
So beautiful.

994
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,940
Be careful.

995
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,940
Good wine.

996
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,420
Who gave you the wine?

997
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,580
You gave me the wine.

998
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,340
Why did you pour my wine?

999
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,140
Why did you pour my wine?

1000
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,420
You're drunk.

1001
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,740
Stop drinking.

1002
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,980
Shouldn't have been rude to your sister.

1003
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,540
Go and怎麼樣.

1004
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,500
Don't be rude to her.

1005
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,700
You should make peace.

1006
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:10,980
stretches

1007
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,500
pronounce

1008
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,060
Master

1009
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,660
You are so good-looking.

1010
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,740
You are better than a mods bonit

1011
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,100

1012
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,340

1013
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,140

1015
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
And...

1016
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,060
What are you laughing at?

1017
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,060
I'll tell you a secret.

1018
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,060
I've never kissed you.

1019
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,060
I...

1020
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:38,060
I met you that day.

1021
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,060
From the white hair to the white hair,

1022
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,060
we spent our years together.

1023
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,060
In the dream,

1024
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,060
a thousand years have passed.
