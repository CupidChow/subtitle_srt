Yuan Jinxia, do you hear me?

58
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,340
I will marry you back home.

59
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,340
You...

60
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,340
Miss Shangguan, what's wrong?

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Why aren't you avoiding me?

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,340
You're in a bad mood.

63
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,340
If you're willing to use me to vent your anger

64
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,340
and vent your pain,

65
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,340
I can't help but ask why you're avoiding me.

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,340
Is something the matter?

67
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,340
This is the medicine I brought back from the capital.

68
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,340
This is the medicine I brought back from the capital.

70
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,340
If I apply it to your injured hand, you won't have scars.

71
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Here, here you go.

72
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Thank you.

73
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Is there anything else?

74
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,340
I'm fine.

75
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,340
I'm just worried that you might be in trouble.

76
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,340
You should go. I want to be at ease for a while.

77
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,340
Miss Shangguan, then you should rest early.

78
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,140
The

79
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,340
Flowers are for sale!

80
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Look, this one is pretty.

81
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,340
Do you want flowers?

82
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
Your Highness.

83
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
Miss Shangguan, do you want flowers?

84
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
Your Highness.

85
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Here, flowers.

86
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
Do you want them?

87
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,340
Look, Miss.

88
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Look! Look! Look!

89
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,340
There's a paper!

90
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,340
Your Highness, what should we do with this paper?

91
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Miss, I heard that you don't speak local dialect.

92
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,340
The paper we sell in Yangzhou is the best.

93
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
Of course.

94
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,340
If you like it, buy one.

95
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,340
Or I can teach you.

96
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
You can cut one yourself.

97
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
Cut it yourself?

98
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
Yes, cut it yourself.

99
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,340
Cut one?

100
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,340
Okay, okay.

101
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
Here.

102
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,340
Here.

103
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,340
Thank you.

104
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
Thank you, Grandma.

105
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
Sir.

106
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Here.

107
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
Here.

108
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
Here.

109
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Here.

110
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,340
Here, take it.

111
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,340
Look, from here.

112
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Cut it like this.

113
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,340
Here.

114
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,340
Miss.

115
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,340
This is the pair of swords that Master taught us when we were in Shaolin.

116
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
Yes, that one.

117
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
I remember it very well.

118
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,340
There's a string of red beans on it.

119
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

120
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Thank you, Miss.

121
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,340
What did you pick?

122
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
What is this?

123
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
Is it a round apple?

124
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,340
What? What apple?

125
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I picked the face of Jin Xia.

126
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,340
Can't you see it?

127
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
Who is your family? Don't talk nonsense.

128
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Xie Xiao, is my face so fat?

129
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,340
I can't cut it.

130
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,340
And I think I'm not bad at it.

131
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,340
It's cute.

132
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Jin Xia, what did you pick?

133
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Fish.

134
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,340
A fish?

135
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,340
This is not an ordinary fish.

136
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,340
It's a fish that can fly. It's called Kun.

137
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,340
Kun?

138
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,340
Why do you pick this thing?

139
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,340
I think that since we came to Yangzhou, we've always been in the sky.

140
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,340
If it's possible, I really want to be a fish that can fly.

141
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,340
Why don't you pick it?

142
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,340
It's something that children play. I won't pick it.

143
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,340
He definitely won't pick it.

144
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Jin Xia, I have something to tell you. Let's go.

145
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
Let's go.

146
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,340
Old grandma, these are the children's money.

147
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Okay.

148
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
I...

149
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
Be careful.

150
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Where are we going?

151
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,340
Just ahead.

152
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Let's go.

153
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
What's wrong?

154
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,340
I...

155
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Just say it.

156
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,340
You didn't say my betrothal gift that day.

157
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
I really like you.

158
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
After I came home, I thought about it for a long time.

159
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I felt that I was being too impulsive.

160
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,340
So I decided to pursue you first.

161
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,340
I want you to see my good side.

162
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Xie Yuanyuan, you...

163
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
Yuan, listen to me.

164
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Although I don't like to study, I remember a sentence in Guanju.

165
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,340
A girl who is good at dancing, but she's not good at dancing.

166
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,340
She's not good at dancing, but she's not good at dancing.

167
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,340
She's good at dancing, but she's not good at dancing.

168
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,340
I said the same thing that day.

169
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,340
She's good at dancing, but she's not good at dancing.

170
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,340
I'm not a girl who's good at dancing.

171
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,340
Okay, okay, don't say it. Let's go.

172
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,340
Jin Xia, you're right. Listen to me.

173
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Okay, you say it.

174
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Do you want to make a wish?

175
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,340
No.

176
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,340
I know you must think I'm not mature enough.

177
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
Senior Sister always says that.

178
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,340
But I really want to cover up for you.

179
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,340
I want to learn to change myself for you.

180
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,340
Jin Xia, be with me.

181
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
I'm leaving.

182
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
I'm leaving.

183
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,340
I'm leaving.

184
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,340
I'm leaving.

185
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
I'm leaving.

186
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,340
I'm leaving.

187
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,340
I'm leaving.

188
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,340
I'm leaving.

189
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,340
Everyone likes to put their wishes on these unrealistic things.

190
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
Everyone likes to dream.

191
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
The good luck is always good.

192
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,340
Isn't it?

193
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Yes, everyone likes to make mistakes.

194
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,340
Thank you, Rong Yao.

195
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,340
You're the first man who has ever been so kind to me.

196
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Thank you, thank you. I'm really very grateful.

197
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,340
We've been together since we were little. We're so happy.

198
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,340
But I...

199
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,340
I've always treated you like a brother.

200
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,340
I've never thought about liking you.

201
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,340
I don't like you either.

202
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,340
I...

203
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
I...

204
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,340
It seems that Young Master Xie's dream is about to come true.

205
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,340
Xie Yuan Yuan is...

206
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,340
Enough, stop talking. I know it.

207
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Let's go.

208
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Okay, let's not talk about this.

209
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Look, they're all waiting. Let's not wait. Let's go.

210
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Let's go. What are you waiting for? Hurry up, Xie Yuan Yuan. Hurry up.

211
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,340
Let's go. What are you waiting for? Let's go.

212
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,340
I'll take you to fight. Hurry up.

213
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Let's go.

214
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Let's go.

215
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Jin Xiang, no matter how many times you reject me,

216
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,340
I won't give up.

217
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
Sir.

218
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,340
Senior Sister, I'll go back first.

219
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,340
I'll take my leave too.

220
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,340
Thank you for your help earlier.

221
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,340
If you need anything, just tell me.

222
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,340
Thank you, Master Shang Guan.

223
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,340
Why are they all leaving?

224
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,340
Qing Yue, buy some lanterns for me.

225
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
Okay.

226
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Sir, why are you suddenly putting out lanterns?

227
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,340
Nothing, I just suddenly want to dream.

228
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Sir, this is what you call dreaming?

229
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Look.

230
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,340
Wow, it's so beautiful.

231
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,340
It really is like a dream.

232
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,340
This is the first time I've seen a lantern like this.

233
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Every time I finish a task,

234
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,340
I'll sit by the river with my hand written on it.

235
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,340
I close my eyes,

236
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,340
nothing is heard.

237
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,340
I feel the breeze blowing, birds singing and cicadas chirping.

238
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,340
I can relax.

239
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Today's Yangzhou city is very different.

240
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,340
It's really like a dream.

241
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Everyone is not willing to wake up.

242
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
It's a pity.

243
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Dreams always wake up.

244
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,340
Sir.

245
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,340
Xie Xiao is after you.

246
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,340
I've already made it clear to him.

247
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,340
Are you being silly,

248
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,340
or are you really not interested in him?

249
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Sir, why are you saying this?

250
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
For the sake of Young Master Xie,

251
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
you don't need to be so harsh on yourself.

252
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,340
I'm guilty of losing the prisoner.

253
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,340
Sir, you can see it clearly.

254
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,340
If you don't have any affection for him,

255
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
how can you make it this far?

256
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
How do you know?

257
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
How much do you know?

258
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
I arranged everything.

259
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
How much do you think I know?

260
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
What did you say?

261
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
The prisoner was taken away by Xie Xiao.

262
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
This is the deal of Lu Yi and Shangguan Department.

263
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,340
No wonder.

264
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
I remember it.

265
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,340
I was just guessing.

266
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,340
You told Sister Shangguan about our actions

267
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,340
to get the birthday cake.

268
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
I didn't expect...

269
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,340
Sir.

270
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

271
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
I would have been beaten for nothing.

272
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,340
How do I know you have such a deep love for Young Master Xie?

273
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,340
I...

274
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,340
I was afraid that you would punish me

275
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
and I would be punished for being late.

276
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,340
I thought you were strict in your work.

277
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,340
I didn't expect that I was just a pawn in your hands.

278
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,340
How can I tell the pawn

279
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,340
how to play the chess?

280
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
So you are complaining now.

281
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
I didn't tell you the truth before.

282
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
I dare not.

283
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
If it's not complaining, it's being arrogant.

284
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,340
You thought you were teasing me.

285
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
You didn't expect that I knew it.

286
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
So you are not sincere now.

287
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
No.

288
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,340
How can I tease you?

289
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
I dare not.

290
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
You put the sand-burning bamboo down

291
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
and got hurt on purpose.

292
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,340
You tried to hide it from the world.

293
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,340
In the end,

294
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
I'm not the one you are teasing.

295
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
I don't care if I don't want to be angry with you.

296
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,340
You still want to be angry with me?

297
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,340
No.

298
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
Sir, you are serious.

299
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,340
How can I be angry with you?

300
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,340
I know the medicine you gave me...

301
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
Give it to me.

302
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
Yes.

303
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
Don't say it's me.

304
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
I understand.

305
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,340
You are a good man.

306
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,340
I really appreciate it.

307
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
In fact,

308
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
you teased me once.

309
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,340
I teased you once.

310
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
It's even now.

311
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
It's even now.

312
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
Okay.

313
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
Make a wish.

314
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Why don't you make a wish?

315
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Leave it to you.

316
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
I won't make a wish.

317
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,340
Leave it to me?

318
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
Thank you, sir.

319
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
The first wish I made

320
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,340
is to have a good family.

321
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,340
I hope I can find my family soon.

322
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
The second wish

323
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,340
is to have a happy life

324
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,340
and smile more every day.

325
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,340
Don't be so mean all day.

326
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,340
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,340
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,340
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,340
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,340
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
I'm sorry.

346
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,340
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,340
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,340
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,340
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
Can you give me the axe?

362
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,340
All right.

363
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Nine...

364
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
Nine...

365
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,300
The

366
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,860
Lord, the bones in the shoulder are quite good.

367
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,700
In a few days, it will be fully healed.

368
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,340
Once Master's leg is healed, we can go back to the capital.

369
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,540
Yes. Thank you, Doctor Shen and Sir Lu.

370
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,140
I never thought that I would stand up and walk well in this life.

371
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,540
It's just a matter of raising your hand. You're too kind.

372
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Master, there's a man from the Wu An Gang outside.

373
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,340
He's injured and has symptoms of poisoning.

374
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,240
He's badly injured.

375
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,540
Let's go. Let's go take a look.

376
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,140
Da Yang, take care of Master. I'll go take a look.

377
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,740
Okay.

378
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,340
Father, don't move. Rest well. They're here.

379
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,340
I wonder if there's a Shang Guan girl from the Wu An Gang.

380
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,340
I'll go take a look.

381
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,940
Okay.

382
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,740
Let's go.

383
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,540
Hurry up.

384
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,740
Hurry up and get the life-saving pill.

385
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,940
And the honey cake from my father.

386
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Doctor.

387
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,740
Tell me. Who hurt you?

388
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,140
Young Master, it's... it's the people from the Eastern Camp.

389
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,340
The people from the Eastern Camp?

390
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,940
The Japanese pirates?

391
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,740
How many people are there?

392
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,140
They're many.

393
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,940
And they're very fierce.

394
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Tell me. Where did you meet them?

395
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,940
At the Lu Wei Village in the city.

396
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,540
We just brought them back.

397
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,340
For years, the Japanese pirates have been rampaging in the southeast.

398
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,140
I thought they were just making trouble in the coastal areas.

399
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,140
I didn't expect them to appear here.

400
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,540
Young Master, you must...

401
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,340
Brother!

402
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
Doctor, hurry up and take a look.

403
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,940
He's already out of alcohol.

404
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,540
Doctor, it's impossible!

405
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,740
Please take a look again. He was fine just now.

406
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,940
Doctor! Doctor!

407
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
What did you find, Sir?

408
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,140
This wound doesn't look like it was injured by a blunt weapon.

409
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,940
One, two, three, four, five. Five wounds.

410
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,140
Don't move! What if it's poisonous?

411
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,340
What are you doing? You're so stubborn.

412
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,220
I've been a

413
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,140
You have to be careful.

414
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,140
What if you die here and I leave?

415
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,940
Don't touch it.

416
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,340
Sir, this wound...

417
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,740
I thought so too.

418
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,140
What are you talking about? How can I not understand?

419
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,740
It's said that there's a kind of skill in the East Camp.

420
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,540
It attracts people.

421
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,740
If you practice this skill, you'll have ten fingers, four nails,

422
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,540
and a broken wrist.

423
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,740
You can immediately treat it.

424
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,540
You're a man of a thousand swords.

425
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,140
How dare you kill people in my Wuwan Sect's territory?

426
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,340
I must find these pirates and chop them into pieces.

427
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,340
I'll go to the garrison now.

428
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,340
I'll go with you.

429
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,540
This is it.

430
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,340
Don't waste your energy.

431
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,740
If I'm not with you, you can't get out.

432
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,540
I read the Chinese and Chinese-speaking warriors.

433
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,340
There's a sword in the village.

434
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,940
When I read the Chinese and Chinese-speaking warriors,

435
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,140
there's a big road in the village.

436
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,740
When the three brothers of the Ruan Sect went out to the desert...

437
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,940
How can you read those books?

438
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,340
Those books are for the good men of the forest.

439
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,540
What's wrong with the official duty? Why can't I read them?

440
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,540
That's true. In this situation,

441
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,140
even if one day you're forced to be a slave,

442
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,340
I don't think it's strange.

443
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,140
You...

444
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,740
That's right.

445
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
Look at this.

446
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,340
It's a nice village.

447
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,940
It's interesting.

448
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Let's take everything with us.

449
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,740
And burn this village.

450
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,940
Where are we going tomorrow?

451
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
That village.

452
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Give me the money.

453
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Give me the money.

454
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,140
It's nice.

455
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,140
It's a nice place.

456
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,140
It's so funny.

457
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,140
Look at this.

458
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,140
It's beautiful, right?

459
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,540
That's right.

460
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,540
This is a nice place.

461
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,140
This is a nice place.

462
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,340
I wonder which family they took away.

463
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,140
Even the rich and old people won't let go.

464
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Money and women.

465
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,540
Take them with you.

466
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,740
Just these few people?

467
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,140
Look at him.

468
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,140
Look at him.

469
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,040
I'll find it out.

470
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,080
Let's just move secretly.

471
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,800
That Dongyi people have great שאמ Volleyball expertise.

472
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,560
Let's not let it happen.

473
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
Our brothers are dead!

474
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,960
How can we simply let them die?

475
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,400
Detective Of The Me宮

476
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
Imprisoned smack!

477
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,560
Imprisoned smack!

478
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,200
Please don't.

479
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,560
Imprisoned smack!

480
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,660
You see.

481
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,800
Move.

482
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,340
Move.

483
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,660
I can tell you the difference by looking!

484
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,700
First.

485
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,220
You think a fight does not make you reject the challenge?

486
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,260
No!

487
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,640
Second!

488
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,960
Third!

489
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,760
You can risk your life!

490
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
I thought the people of the Eastern Regions were powerful.

491
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
They are all masters of bullying, softening and fearing.

492
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Sir, look at this token.

493
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Say it.

494
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
What does this sign mean?

495
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
This is the sign of the Eastern Regions.

496
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
It means that the Eastern Regions are powerful.

497
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
It means that the Eastern Regions are powerful.

498
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
I don't want to talk about it.

499
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
I'm going to avenge my brothers in the gang.

500
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Say it. Who are you?

501
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
He died pretty quickly.

502
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

503
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Hero. Hero.

504
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
I'm not with them.

505
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
I was forced. I was forced.

506
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
I was forced.

507
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
So you are a group of fake people.

508
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
So you are a group of fake people.

509
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
No. No. No.

510
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
They are real people. I was caught.

511
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
My name is Wang Ma Zi. I'm a fisherman from Zhoushan.

512
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I was forced to be a translator.

513
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I... I... I don't even know how to do martial arts.

514
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
You are so fluent in Eastern Regions.

515
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
You want to lie to me?

516
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
No. I'm really not.

517
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Say it.

518
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Why do you speak Eastern Regions?

519
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Hero.

520
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
I was a fisherman in the sea in the early years.

521
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Sometimes I would sell fish to the people of the Eastern Regions.

522
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
I would say some Eastern Regions when I was young.

523
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
According to what I know, the court is always in the sea.

524
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Those who can sail in the sea are all people.

525
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
Wang Ma Zi.

526
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

527
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
No. I was not sensible when I was young.

528
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
They say that I can make money in the sea.

529
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
If you dare to talk nonsense again, tell me.

530
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
I'm telling the truth.

531
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Really. I've changed my mind.

532
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Otherwise, I can't get off the ship, right?

533
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Please spare my life. Please spare my life.

534
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Don't make a sound.

535
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Someone is coming.

536
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Sir.

537
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Don't move.

538
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Sir. It seems to be a Japanese pirate.

539
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
So many Japanese pirates. The government doesn't know it.

540
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm sorry.

541
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
I didn't know it.

542
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
It seems that this matter is not that simple.

543
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Don't run.

544
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,960
Qi Xiu.

545
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Don't chase.

546
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Follow them. See where their old court is.

547
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Go.

548
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Don't chase.

549
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Don't chase.

550
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Don't chase.

551
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Stop.

552
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
You come alone.

553
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
You come alone.

554
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Where is Young Master Xie?

555
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Why don't you see him?

556
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm not good enough to deal with you.

557
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
How can I be with you?

558
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
You are a good girl.

559
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
I don't dare to underestimate you.

560
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
You are well prepared.

561
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Of course.

562
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
I'm not ready to be a concubine.

563
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
How can I ask you to marry me?

564
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Marry you?

565
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
You don't care about your weight.

566
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Ridiculous.

567
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Don't be angry.

568
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
We are all businessmen.

569
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
We are all businessmen.

570
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
We are all businessmen.

571
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
You are the one who started the trouble.

572
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
You are the one who started the trouble.

573
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
How can you say that?

574
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
How can you say that?

575
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Although the dock is under your care,

576
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
The dock is under your care,

577
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
But the shipping is not yours.

578
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
You are from the Wu An Gang, right?

579
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I'll stop the ship and deliver the goods.

580
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
What can you do to me?

581
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Besides,

582
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Xie Baili is old.

583
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
He is half-dead.

584
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Xie Xiao is not in the Wu An Gang.

585
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
You are a woman.

586
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
How long can you hold on?

587
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Dong Qisheng,

588
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Keep your mouth shut.

589
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
As long as I'm here,

590
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Don't try to act smart on the Wu An Gang's territory.

591
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
You are angry.

592
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
I think

593
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
You should marry me.

594
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
We are businessmen.

595
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
We are businessmen.

596
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Isn't it a good thing?

597
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
The old village head and the village head made a rule.

598
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
The two gangs are different.

599
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
They don't interfere with each other.

600
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
You are not only acting smart on the Wu An Gang's territory,

601
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
You are not only acting smart on the Wu An Gang's territory,

602
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
I'll tell you today

603
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
What is the martial arts of the Jianghu.

604
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
What is the martial arts of the Jianghu.

605
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Go.

606
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Go.

607
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Go.

608
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Shangguanxi, wait.

609
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
I will let you obediently obey me.

610
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Nianjia, watch the dock.

611
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
If there is a situation, report it in time.

612
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Yes.

613
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
Master, something happened to the gang.

614
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Go.

615
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Everyone, come.

616
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Hurry up.

617
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Hurry up.

618
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Hurry up.

619
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Hurry up.

620
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Hurry up.

621
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
You are injured.

622
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Are you okay?

623
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Master, you are finally back.

624
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Who did it?

625
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,960
The Eastern Guards.

626
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Where is Young Master?

627
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Young Master and the imperial guards from the capital

628
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
and Yuan Bukai went to the garrison.

629
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Jin Xiang.

630
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Which direction?

631
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
North of the city.

632
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Master.

633
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
What's wrong?

634
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Master, something bad happened.

635
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Someone found two corpses in the garrison.

636
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
What?

637
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
He...

638
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Hide this man.

639
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Others, follow me.

640
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Yes.

641
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Are you okay?

642
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Go.

643
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Go.

644
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Go.

645
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Jin Xiang, don't worry.

646
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
I will go to the garrison.

647
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Jin Xiang, don't worry.

648
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
I will protect you.

649
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Master, over there.

650
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Over there.

651
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
It's weird. Those pirates are all gone.

652
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Dragon-Eye Village.

653
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Listen.

654
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Who is Zhu Shao?

655
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Let's go.

656
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Look at this. It's so cruel.

657
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,960
Is it?

658
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,960
Yes.

659
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
It's so scary.

660
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Yang Yue, check the body.

661
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Please, sir.

662
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,960
Did you find these bodies here?

663
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,080
No, they were taken out from the cavern.

664
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
It's hard to get in.

665
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Let's go inside.

666
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Xiao Fei, take people to check it.

667
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yes.

668
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Let's go.

669
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Hurry up.

670
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Hurry up.

671
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
Open the door.

672
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Shangguan, are you okay?

673
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Do you need to rest for a while?

674
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
They were killed by the poison.

675
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,820
Judging from their disguise, they must be Jinxia's men.

676
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Let's go.

677
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Look.

678
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
The gorge is badly damaged.

679
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,320
There must have been a fierce fight.

680
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
Jinxia must have captured the pirates.

681
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,240
The pirates killed themselves to keep the secret.

682
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,560
There's no blood on the secret.

683
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
Jinxia and the others are probably not in danger.

684
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Don't worry.

685
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
Wait.

686
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,100
This is the mark left by Jinxia.

687
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Over there.

688
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,900
Kill them!

689
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Kill them!

690
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Kill them!

691
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
Kill them!

692
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Kill them!

693
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Kill them!

694
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Kill them!

695
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Kill them!

696
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Kill them!

697
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
What are you doing? Let us go!

698
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Don't bother. We just took a poison.

699
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
We're weak now.

700
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
We can't recover in three or five hours.

701
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,600
The wind blows, the boat

702
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
The heart is empty

703
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Thousands of miles of ambush

704
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Who is out of the city

705
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,080
Can't beat fate

706
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,200
Close your eyes, I can see your face

707
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Open your eyes, I can see your face

708
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Open your eyes, I can see your face

709
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Who is out of the city

710
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:04,600
No sound, the dark clouds

711
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,720
The fate turns

712
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,840
See through the changes in the world

713
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,840
Like farewell, farewell is too sad

714
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,960
There is a golden leaf

715
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Meet you that day

716
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,200
White hair in the sky

717
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,320
Hand in hand to read the years

718
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
About to meet you someday

719
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:53,080
talk about your war
