00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeat is still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ooh

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ooh

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ooh

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ooh

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ooh

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ooh

Zhu Si Ma Jing

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This Yan Shi Fan

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He is a traitor

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He didn't even give the land to Mao Hai Feng

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He dared to live in the royal land

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Even a fake

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In the name of Si Ma Chang'an

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He is a traitor

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He is not only a traitor

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He is going to overthrow our Ming Dynasty

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If not

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I will not be a laughing stock

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Your Majesty

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yan Shi Fan's mouth is hard to say

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I suggest Your Majesty to make a decision

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Decision

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's too cheap for Yan Shi Fan

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Li Fang

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Your Majesty

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You know

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yan Shi Fan is poor and evil

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He is not willing to give up

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I order

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Lu Qian Shi

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Please go to the Imperial Guards

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I obey

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Go

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Go

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Lord Lu

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What a big official position

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Say it

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to the North Town Office with you

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Or go to the six gates with you

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
To cooperate with the investigation

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Personally

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I prefer to go to the six gates

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Who can think of

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let Lord Lu's heart-wrenching small supplement

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's actually the remnant of Xia Ran

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You say

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If the emperor knows this

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What will happen

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Lord Yan

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What do you have to say

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Or take it to the local office

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The emperor has given the imperial decree

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yan Shi Fan is evil and ungrateful

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He is dead

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
impossible

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You are lying

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Lord Yan, do you remember Mao Hai Feng?

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He has put all the letters you have come to me

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And that royal treasure

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Lord Yan should not have forgotten

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I do not believe

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Where is the imperial decree

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You will see it in a while

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Take away

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What are you doing

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you doing

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What are you doing

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let me go

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You let me go

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Lu Yi, let me go

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What is this

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why did you kill him

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He is not a good person

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He did something bad

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He did something bad

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If he killed him, he would be easy on him

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He should be killed

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Take the prisoner Yan Shi Fan

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Kill him

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Take the prisoner

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yan Shi Fan, kill him

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Kill him

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Kill him

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Kill him

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Kill him

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Kill him

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Kill him

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kill him

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Kill him

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
Kill him!

107
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,080
Kill him!

108
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
Kill him!

109
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,800
Go to hell,

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
Kill him!

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Kill him!

112
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,640
Kill him!

113
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,560
Kill him!

114
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,960
Kill him!

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Kill him!

116
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Kill him!

117
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,640
It's time.

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,560
The criminal Yan Shifan

119
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,560
is guilty of treason and is a thief.

120
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,720
Kill him!

121
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,600
Kill him!

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,320
Kill him!

123
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:18,640
Kill him!

124
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,800
Kill him!

125
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Kill him.

126
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,720
Kill him.

127
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:32,980
지원

128
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,600
father, mother

129
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
grandfather

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,600
you see

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
This day

132
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
has finally come.

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,680
Yan Shi Fan was beheaded.

134
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,280
The Yan family is here.

135
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,440
Our revenge is finally over.

136
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,600
Xiaolan.

137
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,720
You have a ambition.

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,240
You can finally rest in peace.

139
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Good!

140
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,480
Good!

141
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,320
Good!

142
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Good!

143
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,080
Good!

144
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Good!

145
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,560
Don't worry.

146
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,520
This evil man

147
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,080
has finally come to his senses.

148
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,360
Grandpa.

149
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
No one can defeat us in the future.

150
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
We can live a good life.

151
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,320
Shi.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,600
I finally wait for this day.

153
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,080
Today is a good day.

154
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
We should celebrate it.

155
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,200
You're right.

156
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
We should celebrate it.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,960
Good!

158
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,960
Good!

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,080
Good!

160
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,320
Good!

161
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,160
Good!

162
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Good!

163
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,080
Good!

164
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,120
Good!

165
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,840
Good!

166
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Yan Shi Fan.

167
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,400
This is the price

168
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,080
you have to pay for betraying me.

169
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,320
Your Majesty.

170
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,920
Uncle.

171
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
Uncle Maい has said

172
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:34,920
Jincheng

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,220
has has been been Rosemallow gardens

174
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,640
since childhood.

175
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,720
Your Majesty.

176
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,200
How do you want to know now.

177
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,560
I will be the one to bear the consequences.

178
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,520
I preplay my escape.

179
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,520
I've also fulfilled everyone's wishes.

180
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,120
You also have a great reward.

181
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,520
What are your plans for the future?

182
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,120
Plans?

183
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,320
I'll work hard at the Sixth Gate.

184
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,520
Then I'll help my mother sell tofu.

185
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,920
I'll work hard to earn money to support my mother and my aunt.

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,120
I'm talking about Lu Yi.

187
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,520
You should know him very well.

188
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
That's called inner face.

189
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,720
If you wait for him to come to you,

190
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,920
the food will be cold.

191
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,520
Uncle, can you not say this first? I'm a little dizzy.

192
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,920
I can understand. I don't mean anything else.

193
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
I just feel that there are regrets in life.

194
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,520
The rain falls, the flowers are lost

195
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,520
The thoughts are in the wrong place

196
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,520
The wind blows, the boat is shaking

197
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,520
My heart is in a whirlpool

198
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,520
A thousand miles of ambush

199
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Jinxia, I will definitely give you an explanation

200
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
for what my father did.

201
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I can't live without fate

202
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Close your eyes and think about it

203
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,520
I can see your face when you close your eyes

204
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Open your eyes and see the cold in the back

205
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,520
The sword is full of sky

206
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Who has conquered the world

207
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,520
No sound, the dark clouds rise

208
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,520
The wind blows, the boat is shaking

209
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I can see the change in the world

210
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I want to say goodbye, but it's too sad

211
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,520
You came just to say this to me.

212
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I just draw a piece of paper

213
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,520
The day I met you

214
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
The white hair of the same blood

215
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,520
The years of our hands

216
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,520
I look back and think about it

217
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Stop! Stop!

218
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Stop!

219
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Stop!

220
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Sir, please let me go.

221
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Move aside.

222
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I dare not do it again.

223
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Jinxia, something happened.

224
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
What happened?

225
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I heard from the village head that

226
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Lu Yi publicly brought out the recruitment letter

227
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,520
for the case of the Xia family at the banquet set by the emperor.

228
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
The emperor was very proud and

229
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
dismissed Lu Yi from the position of super-file.

230
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
What did you say?

231
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,520
I said Lu Yi was dismissed from the position of super-file.

232
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,520
The people of Yanmen have been locked up in Lu's mansion.

233
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Why are you here?

234
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Jinxia, I will definitely give you an explanation

235
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,520
for what my father did wrong.

236
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,520
The power of the Yan family is not what you can imagine.

237
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Your identity must be kept secret.

238
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
No matter how much hatred there is,

239
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
don't be impulsive.

240
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Promise me.

241
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Don't think about it again.

242
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Sir,

243
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,520
it turns out that you have planned it from the beginning.

244
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
But I want to remind you,

245
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,520
the emperor is very arrogant today.

246
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
It is impossible to admit his mistake.

247
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
If he is not punished for one more day,

248
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,520
there is no possibility of recruiting the Xia family.

249
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Lu Yi, you fool.

250
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Stop.

251
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Sir, I said the six gates are not fast.

252
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I have work to do. Please let me in.

253
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
No, no one can enter without a official letter.

254
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Let me in first. The official letter will arrive later.

255
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Stop.

256
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Miss Yuan.

257
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Miss Yuan.

258
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Miss Yuan.

259
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Miss Yuan.

260
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Miss Yuan.

261
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Miss Yuan.

262
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Miss Yuan.

263
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Miss Yuan.

264
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Miss Yuan.

265
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Miss Yuan.

266
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Here.

267
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Exclusive.

268
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
You came just in time.

269
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
You are the imperial guard.

270
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Take me in.

271
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
To be honest,

272
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
when you logs in, I was withdrawn from the job.

273
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I can't even go in now.

274
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
What can I do?

275
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
to find a way to raise money

276
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
to meet you.

277
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
But...

278
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
But what?

279
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
You were executed by the emperor

280
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,520
and you dare to plead for the crime of being a traitor.

281
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm afraid you will die a terrible death.

282
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
How much money does the money need?

283
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
I'll go and find it right away.

284
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Let's try our best to find a way.

285
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
How much money we can get?

286
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Mother.

287
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Mother.

288
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Can you give me the money to save the dowry?

289
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
I need it urgently.

290
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
What are you doing in the daytime?

291
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
You need money at the first moment.

292
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I have a hard time.

293
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Mother.

294
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
My life is like a hard time every day.

295
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
What's your problem?

296
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
I'll tell you later, okay?

297
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Give me the money first.

298
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Now I promise you

299
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
I will work hard in the future

300
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
and get the money back for you.

301
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
You are so naive.

302
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
How did you get the money?

303
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
You know it.

304
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Why did you save the money?

305
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
To make dowry.

306
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I know you want it.

307
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
If you make a dowry one day,

308
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
I can't get the dowry.

309
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
How can I keep my face?

310
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Mother, I promise you.

311
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I can get married without the money.

312
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Give me the money first.

313
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,520
You are so capable.

314
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Are you confused?

315
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Think about it.

316
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Mother.

317
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
No.

318
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Listen to me.

319
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Please.

320
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Give it to me.

321
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
I'm in a hurry.

322
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
No.

323
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
You don't even know how to make a dowry.

324
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
You can't help at all.

325
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
You need money when you go home.

326
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Lu Yu is going to be beheaded.

327
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
How can it be?

328
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
His Majesty values him so much.

329
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
He is being killed for the case of Xia's family.

330
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
His Majesty wants to kill him.

331
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
How can he say that?

332
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
So I'm in a hurry now.

333
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I want the money.

334
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
I want to see him.

335
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I want to find a way to save him.

336
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
But I can't see him without the money.

337
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Don't cry, Jin Xia.

338
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Don't cry.

339
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Get up.

340
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Get up.

341
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Get up.

342
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
You will cry when you meet something.

343
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
It's all your fault.

344
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Wait.

345
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Take it.

346
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
I've been collecting these for you.

347
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
This is my coffin.

348
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Take it.

349
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Mother.

350
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
It's up to you.

351
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Go.

352
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Thank you, mother.

353
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I'll take you to the back door.

354
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Right here.

355
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Sir.

356
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Jin Xia.

357
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Why are you here?

358
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Why are you so stupid?

359
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
This is my own decision.

360
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Leave it.

361
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
What decision?

362
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
You are not stupid.

363
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
You are not stupid.

364
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
I'm not stupid.

365
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
I'm not stupid.

366
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
I'm not stupid.

367
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Leave it.

368
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
What decision is this?

369
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
The Xia family was killed.

370
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
This has nothing to do with my father.

371
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
This is what I owe you.

372
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I owe you.

373
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
As your son,

374
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
I must give you

375
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
an explanation to the Xia family.

376
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
When your father was recruiting me for the blood test,

377
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
he already explained it to me.

378
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
The reason I avoided you

379
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
was because I couldn't get over that barrier.

380
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
But I never hated you.

381
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Never.

382
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Jin Xia.

383
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
My father treated you like a family.

384
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I don't want you to pay with your life.

385
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
I will definitely get you out.

386
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Don't be stupid anymore.

387
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
His Majesty has already ordered me to go to war in the fall.

388
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Don't come here again.

389
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Don't waste your money.

390
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
After you forget me,

391
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
find a family.

392
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Do you know that I came to see you

393
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
and I have been pregnant for half a year.

394
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I even asked my mother for all the dowry.

395
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I promised my mother

396
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
that even if I didn't get married,

397
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I would get married.

398
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
She agreed to give me the money.

399
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
I remember you once said

400
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
that I would spend my whole life with you.

401
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I was born and raised by a woman.

402
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
You said you wanted to marry me.

403
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Why didn't you keep your promise?

404
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Sir.

405
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Don't give up.

406
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
I know that the food here is not good.

407
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I will definitely find a way to take care of them.

408
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
You must eat well.

409
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Wait for me to get you out, okay?

410
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
I will wait for you.

411
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
What else can we say now?

412
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Let's break the prison.

413
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Let's get Lu Yi out of the prison

414
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
and go to the end of the world.

415
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Xie Xiang, don't be too anxious.

416
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
I have thought about it.

417
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
After we get out of the prison,

418
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
we will go to the end of the world.

419
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
I will wait for you.

420
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
I will wait for you.

421
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
I will wait for you.

422
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
I will wait for you.

423
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
I will wait for you.

424
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
I will wait for you.

425
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I will wait for you.

426
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
It's too difficult for us to

427
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
go to the end of the world.

428
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Then what should we do?

429
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I think of someone.

430
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
But he definitely doesn't want to.

431
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Who?

432
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Xu Jing, the head of the government.

433
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Xu Jing is an old fox.

434
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Xia Er's grandfather, Xia Ran,

435
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
is his teacher.

436
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
When Yan Song was persecuted to death,

437
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
he didn't even say a word of justice.

438
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Yes.

439
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
At the Xiyuan Spirit Banquet,

440
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Xu Jing said one thing for you.

441
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
He will occasionally go to the Xu family

442
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
to have a secret talk with Xu Jing.

443
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
But the adults are usually alone.

444
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
So I'm not sure

445
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
what they are talking about.

446
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
There is no other better way now.

447
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
We can only try it.

448
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Who are you?

449
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
How dare you break into the Xu family?

450
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Mr. Xu,

451
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm a student of the city.

452
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
I broke in late at night.

453
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
Please forgive me.

454
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm Yuan Jinxia,

455
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:15,120
a

456
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,520
You want to frame me?

457
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I dare not.

458
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
I just want to

459
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
tell you that

460
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
I've been friends with you.

461
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
We used to fight side by side.

462
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
That's why I dared to disturb you.

463
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
What's your relationship with Lu Yi?

464
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Lu Yi and I have already settled.

465
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
He trusts you.

466
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,520
But he's bold and unruly.

467
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
He defies the government.

468
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
He actually defies the emperor

469
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
for the Xia Ran case.

470
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
He's so stupid.

471
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
You think so?

472
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
You also think so?

473
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Lu Yi should die for the Xia Ran case?

474
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Who are you?

475
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
How dare you be so treacherous?

476
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
I'm a senior.

477
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
I should call you uncle.

478
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Xia Ran is my grandfather.

479
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,520
You're the descendant of the Xia family?

480
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
No wonder Lu Yi

481
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,520
is going to file a case for the Xia family.

482
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Sir,

483
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
you're underestimating Lu Yi.

484
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
He can obviously

485
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
follow Yan Shi Fan for the sake of Rong Hua.

486
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
He can even rely on Yan Shi Fan

487
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
to protect the Xia family.

488
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm not a person who can't do that.

489
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
I'm just a person who

490
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
can't do that.

491
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
I'm just a person who

492
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
can't do that.

493
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm just a person who

494
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
can't do that.

495
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
I'm just a person who

496
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
can't do that.

497
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
I'm just a person who

498
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
can't do that.

499
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm just a person who

500
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
can't do that.

501
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm just a person

502
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
who doesn't want to lose anything

503
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
to protect the descendants of the Xia family.

504
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
But he didn't do it.

505
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
It was for justice

506
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
and Yan Shi Fan's death.

507
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
He almost lost his life.

508
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Sir,

509
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
you didn't even say a word

510
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
when my grandfather

511
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
was framed up and put into prison.

512
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
I can understand.

513
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
But now,

514
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
you're the only one

515
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,320
I believe you must know her well.

516
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,520
Now only you can save her.

517
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,120
I beg you,

518
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
save her.

519
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
I

520
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
will do my best.

521
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,520
I will do my best.

522
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,720
I will do my best.

523
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
Thank you, my lord.

524
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,520
His majesty's edict.

525
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
To exempt Lu Yi from death,

526
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
but punish him with life imprisonment.

527
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,920
Without my permission,

528
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
no one is allowed to visit him.

529
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,320
Lu Yi, take the edict.

530
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,520
Thank you, my lord.

531
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Lord Lu,

532
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
congratulations.

533
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,920
You are safe now.

534
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,720
Eunuch Li.

535
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,720
Why did his majesty make such edict?

536
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,920
Lord Lu,

537
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,520
you should thank

538
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,720
the head of the cabinet,

539
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,320
Lord Xu Jing.

540
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,320
He

541
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,920
pleaded for you in front of his majesty.

542
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
I even

543
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,320
held a hand for Lord Xu.

544
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,320
Alright, I'm leaving.

545
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,520
You must eat well.

546
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,120
Wait for me to get you out.

547
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,520
Okay?

548
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Silly girl.

549
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,520
How many things

550
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,120
have you done for me outside?

551
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Now

552
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,920
I really can't afford it for the rest of my life.

553
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
Jinxia.

554
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,120
Don't count your money.

555
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,120
His majesty has ordered

556
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,920
not to let anyone visit.

557
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,520
No matter how much money you have,

558
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,120
you can't see Lu Yi.

559
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,320
I wonder how he is doing inside.

560
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,120
He is not here.

561
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,320
He is not here.

562
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,920
He is not here.

563
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,920
He is not here.

564
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,720
By the way,

565
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,520
what do you want from me?

566
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,920
I'm here to resign.

567
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Resign?

568
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm going to run for general Qi Weigang.

569
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,920
To fight against me on the battlefield.

570
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,320
I know it's the hardest time for you.

571
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,720
I should be by your side

572
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,320
in the end.

573
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,120
To go through difficulties with you.

574
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,920
But in the end,

575
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
protecting our country

576
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
is what we men should do.

577
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,520
Jinxia.

578
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Don't worry.

579
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,520
Lu Yi is a good person.

580
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,120
He will be fine.

581
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,320
Yuan Daxia.

582
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,720
Promise me.

583
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,920
Take good care of yourself.

584
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,120
Okay.

585
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,320
You should go.

586
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
Thank you, Yuan Yuan.

587
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,920
Take care.

588
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,320
Go.

589
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,520
I'll treat you to

590
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
the best night snack in Yangzhou.

591
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,120
How about it?

592
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,120
I picked up the face of Jinxia.

593
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,920
Since we are best brothers,

594
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,520
we should take the responsibility together.

595
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,520
Yuan Daxia.

596
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,720
For you,

597
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,520
I went to the mountain to go to the sea.

598
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,320
I even used the fork and the knife.

599
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,120
Don't reject me.

600
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,320
Xie Yuanyuan.

601
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,520
I have enough friends like you

602
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
in my eyes.

603
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,720
I hope you are safe

604
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,720
on the battlefield.

605
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
As for Da Rou,

606
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,920
no matter how difficult the road ahead is,

607
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,120
I'll wait.

608
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
I'm sorry.

609
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Everyone, this is my salary this month.

610
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
I hope you won't take it lightly.

611
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
I'm just being kind.

612
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Miss Yuan, I told you that I can't see him.

613
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Why are you here again?

614
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
We also want to let you in.

615
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
But there's really no other way.

616
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
His Majesty ordered that without his permission,

617
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
no one can see Lord Lu.

618
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
But...

619
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,720
How about you go and beg His Majesty?

620
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Brother, I beg you.

621
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Just let me in and take a look.

622
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
I promise I won't say anything.

623
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
I'll just take a peek, okay?

624
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Don't make things hard for us.

625
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
There's really no other way.

626
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Now, Lord Lu is being very cautious.

627
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Go back.

628
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
Let me in!

629
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Miss Yuan!

630
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Let me in!

631
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Miss Yuan!

632
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Miss Yuan, go back.

633
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Lord Lu!

634
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,720
You stay inside and eat well!

635
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Take care of yourself!

636
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
I'll come see you tomorrow!

637
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Enough.

638
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Go back, Miss Yuan.

639
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Brother, I'm here again.

640
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Miss Yuan, I told you that I can't see him.

641
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Why are you here again?

642
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

643
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
It's the reunion day.

644
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
I thought that you would be working hard here.

645
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
I brought you moon cakes.

646
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Here, try it.

647
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Try it.

648
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Miss Yuan,

649
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
is there any drug in here?

650
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
I'm not that bold.

651
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I'm just a little girl.

652
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
I'm not a girl.

653
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
I'm just a little girl.

654
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
I'm just a little girl.

655
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
I'm not that bold.

656
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
If you don't believe me,

657
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
I'll try it for you.

658
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Don't worry.

659
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Share it with them.

660
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Thank you, Miss Yuan.

661
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
You're welcome.

662
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Come, brothers, come and eat moon cakes.

663
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
This is my mother's moon cakes.

664
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
It's very fresh.

665
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Thank you, Miss Yuan.

666
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Thank you, everyone.

667
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Not bad.

668
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

669
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Can you help me give this moon cake to her?

670
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Sir Lu,

671
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
this is the moon cake that Yuan Jinxia asked someone to bring you.

672
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Thank you.

673
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
I'll wait for you.

674
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Wait for me?

675
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
I know that the food here is not good.

676
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
I'll find a way to make it better.

677
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Don't give up.

678
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,720
I can't help you with your help today.

679
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
I'll give you a free gift in the afterlife.

680
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
I'll give you a free gift in the afterlife.

681
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Don't wait for the afterlife.

682
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
You can give me a free gift in this life.

683
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Thank you, Miss Yuan.

684
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
You're welcome.

685
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
You want to marry someone like this?

686
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
It depends on who you marry.

687
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Who do you want to marry?

688
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Xi'er,

689
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I've told you many times not to do it.

690
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I can do it.

691
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
What if you hurt your baby?

692
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Doctor Lin said that I should move more.

693
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
I didn't do anything serious.

694
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Yes, yes, yes.

695
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
But you should sit and rest.

696
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm more at ease.

697
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Come on.

698
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Yue'er, Xi'er,

699
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
look what I bought.

700
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Dad.

701
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
You're more active than me as a father.

702
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I saw it on the street and bought it.

703
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
I'll use it in the future.

704
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Thank you, dad.

705
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Brother Yang.

706
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Aunt.

707
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Aunt Lin, Uncle Gan, you're here.

708
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Come on, take it.

709
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
What's this?

710
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Let me.

711
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
It's a medicine for the baby.

712
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Just put it on before you sleep.

713
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Thank you, Aunt Lin.

714
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Thank you, Aunt Lin.

715
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Don't thank me.

716
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Thank you, Uncle Gan.

717
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
Thank you, Uncle Gan.

718
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,720
This bastard.

719
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
He hasn't come back yet.

720
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
What a silly boy.

721
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Why did he go again in such a cold day?

722
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Is he coming back?

723
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
No.

724
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Now that's a bad day.

725
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
I'll go get him.

726
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Your Majesty.

727
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
The imperial physician is here.

728
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Do you want to announce it?

729
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
No need.

730
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
I'm very worried about my health.

731
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Your Majesty.

732
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
You can't do that.

733
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
You must take care of yourself.

734
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Your Majesty.

735
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Li Feng.

736
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
I've been dreaming of Lu Ting lately.

737
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,720
When the palace was on fire, Lu Ting knocked on the door and saved me.

738
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,120
Yes.

739
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,520
I still remember it clearly.

740
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Lord Lu Ting looked happy after saving His Majesty.

741
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,720
Pass my order.

742
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,720
All the officials, receive the decree.

743
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,720
By the will of Heaven, the Emperor has decreed

744
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
that I will be free from all harm.

745
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
The people are in great danger.

746
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
I am deeply worried.

747
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,720
This is my own sin.

748
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
I am not worthy of being punished.

749
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
I can be pardoned.

750
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,720
It is already a virtue of God's will.

751
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,720
The criminal of the prison has been remodeled.

752
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,720
He is now a human again.

753
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
He cannot be punished again.

754
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,720
I hereby bid Your Majesty long live!

755
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Your Majesty.

756
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Your Majesty.

757
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,720
Your Majesty.

758
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,720
Your Majesty.

759
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Your Majesty.

760
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Your Majesty.

761
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I waited for you for so long. I thought you wouldn't come.

762
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
I told you to wait for me.

763
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
I will definitely come.

764
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,720
How can I disappoint you?

765
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Your Majesty.

766
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Your Majesty.

767
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
We are going home.

768
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Your Majesty.

769
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Your Majesty.

770
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
Your Excellency.

771
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
From today on, we will never separate.

772
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Okay.

773
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
From now on, I will take care of you.

774
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Isn't that enough?

775
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Then...

776
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,720
Don't worry.

777
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,720
His Majesty has already appointed me as his official.

778
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Can you give me some money?

779
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Once you get married, all the money in the family will be yours.

780
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Really?

781
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
Thank you, Your Excellency.

782
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Your Majesty.

783
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,720
Who is born out of the world

784
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,720
is unable to compare with the fate

785
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,720
When I close my eyes, I can see your face

786
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
When I open my eyes, I can see the coldness in the northern border

787
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,720
and the world is full of darkness

788
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,720
In the mortal world, who has conquered

789
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,720
the world without a sound

790
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,720
The fate turns

791
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,720
and sees the changes in the world

792
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,720
It's like parting, parting is too deep

793
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,720
I miss you so much

794
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,720
The day I met you

795
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,720
My hair turned white

796
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,720
We spent our years together

797
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,720
In the dream, we are so old
