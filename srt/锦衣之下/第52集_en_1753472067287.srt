To theurov Crown

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Little lady

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
You have to be persistent

50
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,300
You have to live well

51
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
I am very looking forward to

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,880
see your disappointment to Lu Yi

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,900
Do you think he would Alleviate again?

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,600
Besides

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
You will let her go?

56
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I have no other choice.

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I have to do this.

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I have to make a bet.

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Romantic and delicious.

60
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Milk tea. I love you, Le Mei.

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Yan Shao Qiong is in prison.

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
And he released her.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
What?

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Our good Mr. Lu can't even ask for a name.

65
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
And he is here to confess?

66
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Yan Shi Fan used Yin Zhou.

67
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
What do you mean?

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
He used Jin Xia's life to threaten me.

69
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
To trade with me.

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
So you gave him all the evidence that Yan Shao Qiong was corrupt?

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I can't just watch Jin Xia die because of me.

72
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
You are so bold.

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
You let Yan Shi Fan take your weakness.

74
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
He will take you everywhere in the future.

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
But you have no way to fight back.

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Jin Xia is not only my weakness, but also my armor.

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I can bow my head because of her.

78
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
But it's also because of her that gave me more power.

79
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Let me fight.

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Armors, human.

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
What should we do next?

82
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Yan's power is complicated.

83
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
We can't defeat them.

84
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
We can't defeat them.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
What do you mean?

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
You gave him Yan Shao Qiong on purpose?

87
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I was afraid of Jin Xia.

88
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
But I thought about it.

89
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I found many strange things in Jin Xia.

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
What do you mean?

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
When Yan Shi Fan was in Hangzhou, he knew my weakness.

92
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Are you really willing to tear your face for this girl?

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm not in a hurry.

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Because you are more anxious than me.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
It's not easy to beg for someone.

96
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
But he didn't do anything to Jin Xia.

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
He just wanted to hit me at the most critical moment.

98
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,600
But I didn't expect that Yan Shao Qiong would use this trick.

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes.

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Yan Shao Qiong must have something important in his hands.

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
That's why Yan Shi Fan threatened you to release him.

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Yan Shi Fan is afraid that Yan Shao Qiong will be the head of the horse.

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He is guilty of stealing my life.

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Grandpa.

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
You haven't recovered yet. Why are you in bed again?

106
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Here, drink this medicine.

107
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
It's so uncomfortable to lie in bed.

108
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Luckily, you are fine.

109
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Otherwise, how can I face the ancestors of Xia Lin and the two families?

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Grandpa, don't worry.

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
My mother has calculated my life.

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I have the golden armor and the god's protection. I won't die.

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Girl.

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
You are in bed.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Yes.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Good, good.

117
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
You don't know that you have been unconscious in bed these days.

118
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
You scared me.

119
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
How is your injury?

120
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
You gave me two days of medicine and I recovered.

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
So, the god doctor's name is not Langde Xunming.

122
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Shu is in good health now.

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Sit down. You are still playing with your mouth.

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Okay, okay.

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Jinxia, I think you have realized a lot this time.

126
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
As long as you are alive, it's more important than anything.

127
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
When you are better, we will take sister Yuan with us.

128
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
We will leave the capital and go to Fuzhou.

129
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
We won't ask about the capital again.

130
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I don't want to ask about the capital either.

131
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
But...

132
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I was the one who forced Qiu Cheng to write the letter.

133
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
It was Lu Ting.

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
What's wrong?

135
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Nothing.

136
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
God doctor, this medicine is so bitter.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I don't know what to do.

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I don't know what to do.

139
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I don't know what to do.

140
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't know what to do.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
I don't know what to do.

142
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I don't know what to do.

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
I don't know what to do.

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't know what to do.

145
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I don't know what to do.

146
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I don't know what to do.

147
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I don't know what to do.

148
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I don't know what to do.

149
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I don't know what to do.

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I don't know what to do.

151
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
I don't know what to do.

152
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
I don't know what to do.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I don't know what to do.

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I don't know what to do.

155
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Jinxia.

156
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
To protect you from the harm you have been subjected to.

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
I will definitely speed up my steps.

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I will remove the Yanshi powder.

159
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I will take your lives in peace.

160
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
My lord.

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Zifeng.

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
The confession is not good for Yan Shi Fan.

163
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Yan Shi Fan will be suspicious of him.

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,200
You're worried about Yan Shao Qiong's safety.

165
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Should we find someone to protect him?

166
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Yan Shi Fan wants to kill someone.

167
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
He just needs to use a finger.

168
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I think Yan Shao Qiong has Yan Shi Fan's criminal record.

169
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,600
I need to find a way to get this record.

170
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Yan Shi Fan

171
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Father said he just got a cold.

172
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Why is it so serious?

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
I don't know the details.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Tomorrow, ask the doctor to come and check.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Yes.

176
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
I feel much better now.

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
I was so worried the other day.

178
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,600
Your medical skills are so good.

179
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Xia Er.

180
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Master.

181
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
You're really better.

182
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,400
I heard you recovered as soon as I came back.

183
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
You're still as good as before.

184
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
By the way, master.

185
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
You came at the right time.

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I have something to ask you.

187
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
What is it?

188
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Who forced Qiu Cheng to write the memorial

189
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,400
to kill my grandfather and my late father?

190
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Xia Er.

191
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,000
Why do you ask this?

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Yan Shi Fan told me that Lu Ting forced him to write it.

193
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,600
I just want to ask you.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
Master.

195
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
Is it true?

196
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
Brother Yang.

197
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
You were arrested by Zhao Yu.

198
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,800
It's also related to Lu Ting, right?

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Tell me.

200
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,000
You're still hiding such a big thing from me.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
Okay.

202
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Since you know it,

203
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
I'll tell you the truth.

204
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Your grandfather Xia Ran received a memorial

205
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
to impeach Lu Ting.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Because the evidence is clear,

207
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
he wanted to report it to His Majesty.

208
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
But he didn't expect that

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Lu Ting would go to the door and beg for it after she heard the news.

210
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,000
Your grandfather finally let her off.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But what kind of person is Lu Ting?

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
She is proud.

213
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,800
How can she be humiliated like this?

214
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
After this incident,

215
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
she hates your grandfather.

216
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
So...

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Yan Shi Fan is telling the truth?

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,600
The Lu family is also my big enemy.

219
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Lu Yi is the son of my enemy.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Brother Yang.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You didn't tell me about Jin Xia's identity.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,400
It's to protect her. I can understand that.

224
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,600
I can't avenge my sister. I don't blame you.

225
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,200
But you didn't mention it.

226
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll tell you again and again.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,600
You must be careful when dealing with the Imperial Guards.

228
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't tell anyone about us.

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
What is Lu Yi's identity?

230
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
He is Lu Ting's eldest son.

231
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
From now on,

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,200
stay away from Lu Yi.

233
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,600
If I see you near her again,

234
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
I'll send you back to the capital right away.

235
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Tell your mother to marry you.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
If I knew this earlier,

237
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,000
I shouldn't have saved her when I was in Feng Lian Ao.

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Sir Lu.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You knew about it earlier, didn't you?

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you afraid that I'll avenge you?

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Or you think it's funny to see me like this?

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's funny.

244
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,800
No wonder.

245
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,600
No wonder you told me to avenge you.

246
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,000
I still believe you.

247
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Jin Xia!

248
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Don't talk to him anymore!

249
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,800
Ling Er!

250
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Lu Yi!

251
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,800
Don't be impulsive!

252
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Fu Zhai Zi Huan!

253
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
Cheng Dong!

254
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Dr. Lin.

255
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
You saved my life.

256
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
If you want to take it back now,

257
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
I won't listen to you.

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Fu Zhai Zi Huan.

259
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll pay for what my father did.

260
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
Okay.

261
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
You said it.

262
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Let go of me!

263
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
Yu Yan!

264
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Move aside!

265
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,800
Father.

266
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,200
Father.

267
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Move aside!

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
Jin Xia.

269
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Do you know what it feels like to be a broken-up family?

270
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
Your father.

271
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,400
Your mother.

272
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,400
They are all your closest relatives.

273
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,200
But they were all killed by Lu Ting!

274
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Lu Yi is Lu Ting's son!

275
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't you want to avenge this?

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

277
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
You don't want to avenge this.

278
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,800
But you can't stop me.

279
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
You don't want to be the child of the Lin family.

280
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,400
But I am.

281
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,600
Move aside!

282
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,200
Yu Yan!

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Jin Xia.

284
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,800
Let him go.

285
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
Jin Xia.

286
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,800
Jin Xia.

287
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
This revenge.

288
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't you really want to avenge me?

289
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Let him go.

290
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Let him go.

291
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Let him go.

292
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Let him go.

293
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Let him go.

294
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,800
Let him go.

295
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,000
You go!

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Go!

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Go!

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let him go.

299
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,400
racist!

300
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,800
behind your back this time.

301
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,600
He...

302
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,000
That's late.

303
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,200
You gotta get up now

304
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
pickup

305
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
Love

306
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,920
It hurts

307
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,500
This what happened is that

308
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,160
I swear to my mother that

309
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:42,220
I was destined to see myself

310
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,680
Remember

311
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,820
don't remove any regain trim

312
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,720
I am still wrong unknowingly.

313
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,360
I used to think

314
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,840
You should go.

315
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,440
Don't come to me again.

316
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,320
Jinxia.

317
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,400
Jinxia.

318
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Go.

319
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Go.

320
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,440
Go.

321
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,000
Jinxia.

322
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Jinxia.

323
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,160
Go.

324
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,440
Jinxia.

325
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,160
Go.

326
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,880
Jinxia.

327
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,720
Commander, you want to see me?

328
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,800
How is Miss Yuan?

329
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,200
She's recovered.

330
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,680
She has gone home from the Western Department.

331
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
Did you send someone to protect her?

332
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,560
Don't worry.

333
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,320
I've arranged it.

334
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,120
Come to my house tomorrow.

335
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,720
I have something to tell her.

336
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,040
Yes.

337
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,120
Miss Yuan, are you there?

338
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,920
Miss Yuan.

339
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,880
Commissar Chen.

340
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,240
Miss Yuan, someone wants to see you.

341
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Please come with me.

342
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,600
Commander, Miss Yuan is here.

343
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
You can leave now.

344
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,400
Yes.

345
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,040
Yes.

346
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,600
Yes.

347
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Miss Yuan.

348
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,400
Yes.

349
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes.

350
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,520
Yes.

351
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes.

352
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
What did she want me for?

353
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Does she know my real identity?

354
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,320
But...

355
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,720
Your eyebrows are like your grandfather.

356
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,800
You're just in time.

357
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,400
My tea is just brewed.

358
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,920
What kind of tea do you like to drink?

359
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,720
I drink any kind of tea.

360
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,160
Sit down.

361
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Don't be nervous.

362
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm not nervous.

363
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,120
After you tell her,

364
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,960
you can be here tomorrow.

365
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,560
Let's go.

366
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,980
To find the murderer and kill the Poder's Number.

367
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,120
Now that you know my identity.

368
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,960
I have not the right to kill you.

369
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,160
But my mom and aunt...

370
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,920
Please let her go.

371
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,200
Don't worry.

372
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
I won't...

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,880
be unnecessary wearied like this...

374
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
and marriageless.

375
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,240
You asked me to come here today

377
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,040
to cut the grass and get rid of the roots.

378
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,280
I just want to talk to you.

379
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
I have nothing to say to you.

380
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,600
It seems that you are not only

381
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
very similar to your grandfather.

382
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,800
Your stubborn temper

383
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,760
is probably similar to yours.

384
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,160
I know you hate me.

385
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,880
You think I'm the one

386
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,160
who ruined your family.

387
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,200
But your grandfather's temper

388
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,640
is also hard to escape.

389
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,640
Nonsense.

390
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,200
He is a clean and upright official.

391
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,640
You colluded with Yan Song to frame him.

392
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,240
He is a clean and upright official.

393
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,040
He is a clean and upright official.

394
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,120
But he has gone too far.

395
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,840
He has gone too far.

396
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,680
At that time,

397
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,920
there was a popular man like him in the court.

398
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,320
He didn't know the Prime Minister

399
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,000
until he saw Fei Hong.

400
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
He didn't know the Prime Minister until he saw Xia Ran.

401
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,080
It seems that

402
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,640
he has to be punished in the eyes of the officials.

403
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,360
You hurt him and you hurt him.

404
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,880
You even find excuses for yourself.

405
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,360
You are so shameless.

406
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,680
You will only make people feel ashamed.

407
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm telling the truth.

408
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't need to find excuses.

409
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,320
At that time,

410
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,920
it was because your grandfather

411
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,320
had a memorial to impeach me.

412
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
I begged him for many times

413
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,200
to suppress this matter.

414
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,480
But he just refused.

415
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,640
Later, he forced me

416
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,360
to kneel down and beg.

417
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,800
This matter

418
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,040
has been in my heart for many years.

419
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,120
Today I finally say it out.

420
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,080
At that time, because of the death,

421
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,400
I was full of hatred for your grandfather.

422
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,720
But so many years have passed.

423
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,080
I can only see it clearly when I think about it.

424
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,920
I didn't kneel down to Xia Ran.

425
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,320
I just can't let go of his fame and power.

426
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
As for your grandfather,

427
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,360
although he is a man of no value,

428
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,080
he can't see my tears.

429
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,200
He is still too soft-hearted.

430
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,360
You still hurt him after all.

431
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,040
Yes.

432
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,360
When I feel sorry for him,

433
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,560
it's too late.

434
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,600
Miss Yuan,

435
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,960
you are Xia Ran's descendant.

436
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,080
It's normal that you have a grudge against me.

437
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,680
I will never take it back.

438
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,560
God 만� looked very grand when Xia Ran was alive.

439
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,920
I don't know what kind of disple gosta will be,

440
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,560
but I want to have a try.

441
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,360
I don't like to take a try.

442
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,400
I know that the law is strict,

443
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,160
I won't take part in it терpesl Kyoto be squats.

444
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,280
I beg Your Majesty to report to me

445
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,120
that my grandfather has committed crime of deceiving the emperor,

446
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,760
tray himusha.

447
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,440
Why are you so Geghe?

448
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,160
Your grandfather made itous for you before.

449
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,760
Here.

450
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,080
Save them if needed.

451
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,160
Tell you what.

452
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,760
Emperor is aclapping for I buzzing blood for Xia.

453
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,640
It makes no sense at all.

454
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,640
You should talk about it again on the day of the new emperor's enthronement.

455
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,840
Otherwise, you'll be burned by fire.

456
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,840
I really hope to see that day.

457
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,640
I've taken this.

458
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
You owe me this.

459
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,040
I don't need to thank you.

460
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
You're too self-conceited.

461
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
The tea is cold.

462
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,840
Sir, you can't go in.

463
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,440
Sir.

464
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,640
Dad, why did you ask him to come?

465
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
What's the fuss?

466
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Cen Fu, send Miss Yuan back.

467
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,040
Yes.

468
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,440
Qing Xiang, are you feeling better?

469
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,240
Much better.

470
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,240
Qing Xiang, let's go.

471
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,840
Go.

472
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Dad, why did you ask him to come?

473
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm fine.

474
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,240
You didn't make him feel uncomfortable, right?

475
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
Look at him.

476
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
He seems to have been embarrassed.

477
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,040
Dad.

478
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,040
Dad.

479
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,240
Uncle Zhong, why is it so serious?

480
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,240
Before you came back,

481
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Master was not feeling well.

482
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,440
After you came back, you were busy with your work.

483
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,240
Master was afraid that his illness would affect you.

484
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,440
So he didn't tell anyone.

485
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
What did the doctor say?

486
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
The doctor said...

487
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
What did the doctor say?

488
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
What did the doctor say?

489
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,440
The doctor said that Master was not feeling well.

490
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,640
I see.

491
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,040
You may leave.

492
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,040
Yes.

493
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,840
This is from Lu Ting?

494
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,640
Yes.

495
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
She said that His Majesty is a selfish person.

496
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,240
He will not bow to her.

497
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,840
We can only wait for the new emperor to ascend the throne

498
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,040
to save the throne and help the Xia family.

499
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
It seems that Lu Ting said that.

500
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,840
I didn't expect that.

501
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
All these years,

502
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,440
she still kept this.

503
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,440
This letter of confession

504
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,040
cannot be known to anyone.

505
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm afraid that she will not be able to read it.

506
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
I can't let anyone know.

507
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,040
If Yan Shi Fan takes it,

508
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,440
it will be hard for the Xia family to wash away the wrongdoings.

509
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,040
Jin Xia,

510
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
you must keep it well.

511
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,840
Master,

512
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,640
there is a minister from the Yang family outside.

513
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Why is he here?

514
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,440
Come.

515
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Help me up.

516
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,640
Please let him in.

517
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,440
Yes.

518
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,240
Minister Yang,

519
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,640
I'll ask Master to come in.

520
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,640
Okay.

521
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
Greetings, Commander.

522
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,040
Sit down.

523
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,240
Thank you, sir.

524
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
I heard that

525
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
you gave him

526
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,240
a letter of confession from the Xia family.

527
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,440
You really came for this matter.

528
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,440
I have done something

529
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,840
that is not easy in my life.

530
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,040
I'm sorry for the Xia family.

531
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm sorry for the Xia family.

532
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,440
This is a good thing.

533
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,640
I also want to thank you

534
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,840
for taking care of Yi'er in Yangzhou.

535
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm afraid that

536
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,240
I'll have to trouble you to take care of him in the future.

537
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm just a servant of the six clans.

538
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
How can I be able to take care of my son?

539
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,640
Yi'er is young and ignorant.

540
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I'm afraid that

541
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,440
I'll have to trouble you to take care of Yi'er in the future.

542
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,040
Every time I see him,

543
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,840
I remember when I first joined the Imperial Guards,

544
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,040
I was dedicated to serving the country.

545
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,440
Whatever it is,

546
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,840
I must change into a black and white.

547
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,440
Now I've lived most of my life

548
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,040
and I'm in a big trouble.

549
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,840
The so-called black and white is just

550
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,240
a different choice and a different position.

551
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,840
You still remember the past.

552
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,040
I can't remember it.

553
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,640
I just can't forget it.

554
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,840
Don't forget that

555
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
you went to the Xia family to report the news.

556
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
You were not shot.

557
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,040
I've spent your life.

558
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,040
But I still have your life.

559
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,040
You've left me a life

560
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
that made me

561
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,240
look at my old friend and be killed.

562
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
I've been living in guilt for more than ten years.

563
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,040
I'm not wrong.

564
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
God is kind.

565
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Fortunately,

566
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
the Xia family still has a living descendant.

567
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,040
Yes.

568
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,440
That girl is good.

569
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,440
She really has some scary things on her.

570
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,440
She's a shadow of God.

571
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,640
But she and Yi'er

572
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,040
are so lucky.

573
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,440
No.

574
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,640
Well...

575
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,940
L�-T sold it?

576
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,740
Hello...

577
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,440
It seems that paper errors in the note have been revealed.

578
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,240
It looks old.

579
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,840
But for so long,

580
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,240
Lu Ting kept this note.

581
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,040
I've been thinking about

582
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,240
how to pay for my grandfather's blood.

583
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
What kind of person is Lu Ting?

584
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,840
I can't figure it out.

585
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,440
She...

586
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Your father,

587
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
your mother,

588
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
and your closest family.

589
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,440
But they were killed by Lu Ting.

590
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,840
Lu is also Lu Ting's son.

591
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Don't you want to take revenge?

592
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
Sir!

593
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,040
How many times has she been here?

594
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
How long has she been standing under this tree?

595
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Yuan Jin Xia, wake up.

596
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
You can never

597
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
see each other again.

598
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,840
Father.

599
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,640
Father.

600
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,640
Father.

601
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,240
I'll go get the doctor.

602
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,840
No, no.

603
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,640
Yi Er.

604
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,840
Sit down.

605
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,640
Sit down.

606
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Sit down.

607
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,040
Take a look.

608
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,440
Father, what is this?

609
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,840
This is the set that I've been

610
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,840
putting in a lot of effort to set up for the Yan family.

611
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
This is a great place.

612
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Feng Shui said

613
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,040
that if you get this place,

614
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,440
you'll get the whole world.

615
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,240
Yan Shi Fan took this land

616
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,840
and built a house on it.

617
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
For many years,

618
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,440
I've been trying to find more evidence.

619
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
But

620
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,040
His Majesty has a deep interest in the Yan family.

621
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,640
Without enough evidence,

622
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,840
His Majesty won't believe it.

623
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,240
Even if you get it,

624
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,840
you'll still get yourself into trouble.

625
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,840
I'm giving it to you.

626
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,840
You must not be too anxious.

627
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,840
You must wait for the right opportunity

628
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
to give it to His Majesty.

629
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,440
Father.

630
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I understand.

631
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Yi Er.

632
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,640
Your mother's death

633
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,840
is a big blow to me.

634
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,240
It's just that I was too young

635
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,240
and too hard-hearted.

636
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,840
In terms of family and career,

637
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,440
I chose the latter.

638
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,240
I know

639
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,840
that you have a lot of complaints about me.

640
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,440
You blame me for being too cold.

641
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,240
But

642
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,240
you'll understand it later.

643
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
There are many things

644
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,040
that you can't help but do.

645
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,040
Father.

646
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,040
Don't say anymore.

647
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
I'll go to see the doctor.

648
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,640
Yi Er, don't go.

649
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,440
Don't go.

650
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,040
Forget it.

651
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,640
Sit. Let me finish.

652
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,040
I've always hoped

653
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
to find more evidence

654
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,640
and wait for the best opportunity

655
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,440
to take down the Yan family.

656
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,040
But

657
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,840
I'm afraid I can't wait any longer.

658
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,640
I'll leave her to you.

659
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,240
And I'll let go of my faith.

660
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,440
Father. Father.

661
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,840
Father.

662
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
I'll go to see the doctor.

663
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,240
Can Feng.

664
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,040
Call the doctor.

665
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,840
Hurry.

666
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,640
Feng.

667
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,040
What should we do with the case?

668
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Wait.

669
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,040
Let's go to the lab first.

670
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
We'll talk about the body later.

671
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,240
Master Xia.

672
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,640
Okay.

673
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,840
What's wrong?

674
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,040
I...

675
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,440
I was on the street.

676
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,840
I saw Bai Ling hanging at the door of Lu's Mansion.

677
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,840
I only knew it when I asked around.

678
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
It was the director Lu.

679
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
He passed away last night.

680
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,840
He passed away last night.

681
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,440
He passed away last night.

682
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Lu Cheng.

683
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,040
When you were caught by Yan Shi Fan,

684
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,440
if it wasn't for the director Lu's concession,

685
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,040
I'm afraid he wouldn't have found you so soon.

686
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,640
Who would have thought

687
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,240
that your relationship with him

688
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,040
would turn out like this?

689
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,040
Do you know?

690
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
During this time,

691
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,440
you've been torturing him.

692
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,440
We're all very sad.

693
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,040
Now,

694
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,840
Lu Cheng Hui has made a mistake.

695
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,040
Can't you two

696
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,240
make up?

697
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,840
Dayang.

698
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,240
Don't say that.

699
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,840
I told you many times.

700
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,640
If you can't bear it, you'll make a big mistake.

701
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,840
You're just too casual.

702
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,640
You'll be a loss if you keep doing this.

703
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
I have my own rules.

704
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Don't worry about me.

705
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
I have no other choice.

706
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,640
I have to hide once.

707
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,240
You've disappointed me too much.

708
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,640
I'm sorry.

709
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,640
I'm sorry.

710
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,640
I'm sorry.

711
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,640
I'm sorry.

712
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,640
I'm sorry.

713
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm sorry.

714
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,640
I'm sorry.

715
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,640
I'm sorry.

716
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,640
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
I'm sorry.

718
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,640
Miss Yuan.

719
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,040
Don't tell her that I came here.

720
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
These are all the files of the government.

721
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,840
Take them back

722
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,840
and read them as soon as possible.

723
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,640
Yes.

724
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,440
Not only do you have to read these,

725
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
from today on,

726
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,040
you'll write all the files of my case.

727
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,840
Your mother's death

728
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,840
was a blow to me.

729
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,040
It's just that I was too young at that time.

730
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,440
I chose the latter

731
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,040
in terms of family and career.

732
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,240
These are the sets

733
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,440
I've put in my heart and soul

734
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,440
for the Yan family for many years.

735
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
You'll know it later.

736
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Watch.

737
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,440
There are many things

738
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,040
that can't be helped.

739
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,040
Yes.

740
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,440
Father.

741
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,440
Since my mother died,

742
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,400
I've been misunderstanding you

743
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
and blaming you.

744
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,640
I thought you and Yan Song

745
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,640
had a good relationship.

746
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
I dare not to be a part of the Yan family.

747
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,800
Wei Zeng Xia,

748
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,520
you've known me for more than ten years.

749
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,280
You're actually trying to break through

750
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,920
the whole Yan family one day.

751
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,240
I'll keep your order in mind.

752
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,560
Leave the rest to me.

753
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Looking at the changes in life,

754
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,040
it's like saying goodbye.

755
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,880
It's too sad to say goodbye.

756
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,600
I'll remember

757
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,480
the day

758
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,960
when I met you.

759
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,120
The day

760
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,480
when we had white hair

761
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,000
and we read the years together.

762
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,600
Get back to dreams,

763
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,480
memories last for thousands of years.
