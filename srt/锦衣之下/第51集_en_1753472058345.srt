00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Untamed

YoYo English Channel YouTube

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Lord Yan

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What brings you here, Lord Lu?

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Did Yuan Bu Kui come to Lord Yan

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To find Doctor Lin?

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Lord Lu, why do you ask about Yuan Bu Kui?

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's wrong with him?

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I heard that a few days ago

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Lord Yan caught Doctor Lin again

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You are a doctor

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It takes evidence to catch a criminal

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is the rule

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Since Yuan Bu Kui didn't come to find Lord Yan

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll leave now

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Next time, bring me some evidence

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Bring it on

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lord, you know that

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yan Shi Fan won't admit it

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why do you still come here?

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I came to let him know

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I already know

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Since he doesn't admit it

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then I'll use my own way

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Lord Yan

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yan Shao Qiong was caught by Xu Jing and Lu Yi

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In the prison

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You can bear this?

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Bear?

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why should I bear?

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've prepared a play

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Waiting for the people to gather

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So that we can start the show

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yan Shi Fan, what are you doing?

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let me go

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't touch me

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Life and death are impermanent

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Disperse and never come back

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can't be with your loved ones

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You have to love and hate each other

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I really enjoy this kind of pain

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I don't know if Lu Yi

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Likes it or not

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're crazy

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let me go

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What is this?

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is a small gift for you

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Miss, to be honest

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I like you

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I wanted to keep you

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And accompany my Ling'er

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
To be her partner

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But your lover is so despicable

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He dares to go against my Yan family

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you want to hate him, go ahead

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't have a lover

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Lu Yi and I have been separated

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He won't be threatened by us

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Really?

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then who came to me today?

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
To ask me for someone?

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, girl

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's make a bet

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
See if your life is important to him

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If he has feelings for you

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He will try his best to save me

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If he has no feelings for you

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It means that your life is over

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Bastard

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you doing?

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yuan Shifan

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I haven't seen anyone

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who can come down alive

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
When being targeted by this

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Bear with it

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Bastard

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will never let you go

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Go on

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The people who were tied up here

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And told you the same words

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They are so beautiful

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But I haven't seen them

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They become something else

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
To come to me

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you want to kill me

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just give me a beating

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I like you

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Seeing others suffer

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And torture me

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It makes me happy

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You'd better not let me live

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Or I will kill you

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And avenge our family

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Avenge your family?

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You must not know

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Except for our family

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You have a bigger enemy

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The one who forced Qiu Cheng to write the negotiation letter

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not me

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But Lu Ting

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You think I believe you

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Just because you said so

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't help it if you don't believe me

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But as long as you are alive

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can ask Lu Yi

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
By the way

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I remember it all of a sudden

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Miss

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You must hold on

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You must live well

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm looking forward to

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Seeing your disappointment to Lu Yi

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hold on

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why didn't I

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Put you in front of the camera

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What are you doing?

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Give it back to me

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Give it back to me

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let me use it

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yan Fang

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Young Master

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You take care of the rest

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Take care of it

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yuan Shifan

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are so stupid

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't die

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Brother Lu

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How is it?

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Where is Xia Er?

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Where is Yan Shifan?

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Take this girl away

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you doing?

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you doing?

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let her go

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let her go

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't move

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let me go

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let me go

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let me go

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't move

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let me go

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yan Shifan knows

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Jin Xia's identity

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He won't spare her

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to beg Yan Shifan

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going to beg him to let her go

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Dr.Yun

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ming'er

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You are going to be

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In danger of Yan Shifan's death

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What should we do?

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We can't wait for him in vain

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I will go back to Beizhen Prefecture

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Send someone to check

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Where is Jin Xia

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you, Mr. Lu

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yan Shifan

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yue'er

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You should keep them safe

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then inform Xiao'er

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I will go back to Lushan Gate

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And bring someone to find Xia'er

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, father

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Be careful

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Uncle Gan

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll help you to my room

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Come

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Young Master

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Last night someone broke into the villa

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And saved Lin Ling and the guy

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Called Uncle Gan

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What happened?

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Isn't the guard there very strict?

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He is not weak

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And he takes a break

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So they didn't take good care of him

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are all useless

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You can all die

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Take this hairpin

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And give it to Lu Yi

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yan Shaoqiong

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Although he didn't make much progress

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But Yan Shifan is not a good person

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Give this to the commander

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Sir

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yan Feng sent this just now

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I will give it to you

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yan Feng

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This hairpin

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yan Feng will give it to you

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What did he say?

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Nothing

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Sir

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Sir

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sir

221
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sir

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Sir

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I want to see Yan Shaoqiong

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Please come in

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mr. Lu

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sorry to keep you waiting

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Sit down

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Where is Jin Xia?

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That girl

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Mr. Lu

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yan Feng just sent you the hairpin

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And you followed her

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And you are so anxious

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It seems that you are so fond of her

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What happened to her?

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I prepared a surprise for you

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What do you mean?

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My stuff

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Is not like the rough torture

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
In your prison

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The blood

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Will be dropped

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
By the long nail

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That is covered with blood

245
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And it will be cut

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And it will be dropped

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And spread to the foot

248
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And by adjusting the length of the nail

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
People will not die immediately

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But they will wait until the blood is dried

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The more blood is left

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The colder people will be

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What do you want?

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What do you think?

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What is your condition?

256
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yan Shaoqiong's statement

257
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't stare at me like that

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You should think about that little cutie

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
She must be cold now

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Dad

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Dad

262
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yan Shaoqiong's statement

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You haven't finished it yet, right?

264
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

265
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yan Shi Fan

266
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What does he want from you?

267
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Nothing

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You haven't finished it yet, right?

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I will give it to His Majesty tomorrow

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Give it back to me first

271
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I have urgent business

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What urgent business?

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Anyway, it's urgent

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Give it back to me first

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Those statements

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Are evidence that His Majesty wants to investigate Yan Shaoqiong's corruption

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
How dare you take it to someone else?

278
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Dad, it's a matter of life and death

279
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's too late to eat it

280
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Give me back the statement first

281
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
No

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Dad

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I beg you

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have never seen you like this since I was a child

285
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I heard Yan Feng gave you a hairpin

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You really did it for women

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yan Shi Fan threatened you with it

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Let you give Yan Shaoqiong's statement

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
When did you become so feminine?

290
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's a matter of liking a girl

291
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But it can't delay the business

292
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Dad

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Dad, let's talk about it after I come back

294
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Give me the statement first

295
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No

296
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Dad

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He might be dead for real

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now he is being held by Yan Shi Fan

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If he drags on and blood flows down

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He will die

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I know Yan Shi Fan's whereabouts in the city

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can send someone to search

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But you can't take the statement

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Besides, it's impossible to let Yan Shaoqiong be convicted again

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I can't care about it anymore

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have my own way to deal with Yan Shaoqiong

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yan Shi Fan wants to take Yan Shaoqiong's statement

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Just to save him

309
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you think he will be stupid enough to be convicted again?

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Besides, you think Yan Shi Fan will release Yan Shaoqiong

311
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
after you give him the statement?

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I have no other choice

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have to do this

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I have to make a bet

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You really let me down

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Dad

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Have you forgotten how mom died?

318
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Mom

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Mom

320
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I can't forget the pain of losing mom

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't want anyone to die because of me

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yan Shi Fan took Jin Xia

323
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and threatened me with her life

324
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I know Yan Shi Fan's intention

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Besides, do you know who is the girl Yan Shi Fan took away?

326
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
She is Xia Ran's granddaughter

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You know how Xia Ran's family died

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Now her granddaughter is in danger because of me

329
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You just let her die because of me?

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, you go to find Yan Shi Fan

331
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I will send someone to search

332
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Please

333
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I hope this girl can be blessed

334
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You are lucky

335
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you, dad

336
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You can't die

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't sleep

338
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I have to live

339
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I really understand this

340
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I can't die

341
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't die

342
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't die

343
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't die

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I can't die

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can't die

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I can't die

347
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I can't die

348
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I really understand this

349
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But who can save me?

350
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Who can save me?

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Supervisor Lu

352
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You are so quick

353
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I took what you want

354
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Tell me where is it

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I will give it to you

356
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You have to show me first

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Tell me where it is

358
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's late

359
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do you know

360
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The long nail pierces into the body

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The blood flows down

362
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
How long will it take for people to die?

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I know

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
People won't die when the blood flows dry

365
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They can't live for two days

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But I think

367
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The girl's body should be more than tonight

368
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Tell me where is it

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I will show you

370
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm not in a hurry

371
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because you are more anxious than me

372
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then wait

373
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But wait for a while

374
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When it's dark, you don't have to worry

375
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because it's useless even if you find it

376
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Tell me where it is

377
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't yell at me

378
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I will tell you

379
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Where is it

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't yell at me

381
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I will tell you

382
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Will you give it to me?

383
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's true

384
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's true

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Now

386
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Now

387
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You have to beg me

388
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You beg me to tell you

389
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Where is Yuan Jinxia

390
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Maybe I will tell you

391
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
When I feel soft

392
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You beg me

393
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I beg you

394
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Tell me where is Jinxia now

395
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Begging

396
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Begging

397
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Do I need to teach you?

398
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Do you want to die?

399
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
No

400
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Please

401
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Sir

402
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sir

403
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm so happy.

404
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Lu Yi.

405
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
They say men have gold under their heart.

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You kneel down to me for a little girl.

407
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm really moved by you.

408
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I thought that even if she died,

409
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
she would die with her family.

410
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
As for the real location,

411
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
you can guess it yourself.

412
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You have to guess it well.

413
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
If you guess it wrong or it's too late,

414
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you'll be dead.

415
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Don't blame me.

416
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'll die with my family.

417
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
My family.

418
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Xia Ran.

419
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Xia's Mansion.

420
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Lian Yi.

421
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Lian Yi.

422
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
How's Uncle Gai?

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He just took the medicine and fell asleep.

424
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Any news about Jin Xia?

425
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We've got the news.

426
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Lu Yi has gone to Xia's Mansion to find Jin Xia.

427
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
My father, Xi and Xie Xiao have gone there.

428
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Let's go.

429
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Let's go.

430
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Search.

431
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Don't let go of anything.

432
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yes.

433
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Go.

434
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes.

435
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Go there.

436
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yes.

437
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Go.

438
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Senior.

439
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There's nothing there.

440
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go to the villa.

441
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Okay.

442
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Go.

443
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yes.

444
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Go.

445
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Go.

446
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Go.

447
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Go.

448
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Go.

449
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Go.

450
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Go.

451
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,240
It's fine, Wen'er.

452
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,840
Really?

453
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,160
I feel I need this precious energy 갚先帐,

454
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,000
take care of Wen'er.

455
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,720
Okay.

456
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,720
Do you still remember?

457
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,440
Remember me?

458
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,160
Each of us..."

459
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,600
Everyone against his own will

460
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,800
Sir, he is bullying you

461
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,160
Sir.

462
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,560
Sir.

463
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,040
Do you want me to carry you?

464
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,960
No, you can't.

465
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,760
I'm not that afraid of people.

466
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,080
When I was about to lose hope,

467
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
you appeared.

468
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,360
Is it worth it

469
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,440
if I offend him?

470
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,240
I can tolerate him

471
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,360
to trample me under his feet,

472
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,320
but I can't

473
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,200
hurt you.

474
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,280
Sir.

475
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,840
Sir.

476
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,920
Sir.

477
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,360
I've been thinking for a whole night.

478
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,480
If I can marry you,

479
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,240
I'll be happy.

480
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
If I can't marry you,

481
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,440
I'll be scared to death.

482
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
It's my destiny.

483
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,360
You know my woman is generous.

484
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
You won't take this little grudge

485
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,560
to heart.

486
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,960
Of course.

487
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,120
Who is your husband?

488
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320
Yuan Jinxia.

489
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,000
I told you not to move.

490
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,480
Why are you so unfamiliar?

491
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Huh?

492
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
So you really want to marry someone?

493
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,880
You keep second guessing.

494
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
Who do you want to marry?

495
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,800
Sir.

496
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,440
Creamed meals have no withered fruit.

497
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,560
Sir, I've searched several secret rooms,

498
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,000
but I didn't find Jin Xia.

499
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,760
You didn't find her?

500
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,760
If something bad happens to Jin Xia,

501
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,800
I'll behead Yan Shi Fan!

502
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,320
Lu!

503
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,560
Didn't you promise to take good care of Yuan Jin Xia?

504
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,760
Now, how did you treat her?

505
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,680
Your identity will be exposed.

506
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,080
It'll be the shame of our Lu family.

507
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,120
I'm the one who killed her.

508
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
Xie Xiao, calm down.

509
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,280
Father, how is she?

510
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:40,960
Yue.

511
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,920
Where is Jin Xia?

512
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,960
Where is she?

513
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,000
Did you find her?

514
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,640
I think it's open now.

515
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,000
And they look strange.

516
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,960
No wonder.

517
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,880
But he named it starred star!

518
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,000
His Dhola...

519
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,320
Yuesheng?

520
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,160
He's the man so why ask you to place he here?

521
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,160
Doctor Lin.

522
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,920
Tomorrow morning,

523
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
we'll take theLao movies.

524
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,240
There, you can tell me.

525
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,560
Ruo Qing and Doggie?

526
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,520
Yes.

527
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,800
Go to see him.

528
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,360
Go to check him.

529
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Do you know where the mechanism of the water flow is?

530
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
I don't know.

531
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,440
My lord.

532
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,840
Did you find anything?

533
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,680
Someone must have touched this place.

534
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,120
We lost our loved ones.

535
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,360
Didn't you two.

536
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,580
I don't have to be worried.

537
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,440
Jinxia.

538
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,440
Jinxia.

539
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,560
auspicious.

540
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:18,420
寡人心兮em добав2不知道的

541
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,560
Gauze

542
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
Bren вами

543
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,180
How could your son achieve so far?

544
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,820
The blood has stopped

545
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,020
We need to use medicine to cure the blood

546
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
When will he wake up?

547
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,620
I don't know

548
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
We need to observe for a few days

549
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,820
Well

550
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,820
We have so many people here

551
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
It will affect Xia'er's rest

552
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
We can leave one or two people to take care of her

553
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,460
Others can leave

554
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,460
Sir Lu

555
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,460
You have been looking for Jin Xia all day and night

556
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,460
You should go back and rest

557
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
We will take care of her

558
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
I should stay

559
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
I am worried about giving Jin Xia to you

560
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,460
So we should take care of Jin Xia

561
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
We should all go out

562
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,460
Let Jin Xia recover her blood

563
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Doctor Lin has said something

564
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Let's go out

565
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,460
Go

566
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,460
Go

567
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,460
Jin Xia

568
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,460
The cat is afraid of water

569
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
It's so sad

570
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
Sir

571
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Don't you think I am sad too?

572
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
You are sad

573
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,460
It's so painful

574
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Sister Yuan

575
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,460
You have been busy all day

576
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,460
You should go to bed early

577
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
I will go back to my room

578
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
How is Jin Xia?

579
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Is she safe?

580
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Sister Yuan

581
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Don't worry

582
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Her breath and pulse are stable

583
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
She will wake up soon

584
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Lu Yi

585
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
He is so kind

586
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
He saved Jin Xia

587
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
He has been watching Jin Xia all day

588
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
He has been watching Jin Xia all day

589
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
I hope these two kids

590
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
I hope these two kids

591
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
I hope these two kids

592
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,740
I hope these two kids

593
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
Sister Yuan

594
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,740
You are so kind to Jin Xia

595
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,740
Go to bed early

596
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,740
Although Jin Xia is very poor

597
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,740
But I am lucky to have you

598
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
I am lucky to have you

599
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,380
Sister Yuan

600
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
I really thank you

601
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,380
I heard Lu Yi

602
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,380
He kneeled to you

603
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
To save his subordinate

604
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,380
You have got your face back

605
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,380
You have got your face back

606
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
It's nothing

607
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
It's nothing

608
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
Sir, Lu Yi found Yuan Jin Xia

609
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
And he saved her

610
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
I am so happy

611
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
I am so happy

612
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
I am so happy

613
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
I am so happy

614
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
I am so happy

615
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,380
I am so happy

616
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
I am so happy

617
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
I am so happy

618
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
I am so happy

619
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
I am so happy

620
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
I am so happy

621
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
I am so happy

622
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,380
I am so happy

623
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,380
I am so happy

624
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
Love

625
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,020
Sir Lu

626
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,020
You have been unconscious for two days and nights

627
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,020
You will fall down

628
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,020
I am fine

629
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
I will not fall

630
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,020
I must accompany Jin Xia

631
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
I...

632
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
Jin Xia.

633
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Jin Xia.

634
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,180
You're awake.

635
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Sir.

636
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,020
You're finally awake.

637
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
I...

638
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
Sir saved me.

639
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,180
I've separated from Lu Yi.

640
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,860
He won't be threatened by you.

641
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Really?

642
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,900
Then who came to my house today

643
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,620
and asked me for help?

644
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Let's make a bet.

645
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,860
See if your life is more important to him.

646
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,060
If he's kind to you,

647
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,300
he'll definitely try his best to save you.

648
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,340
Sir, aren't you going to separate from me?

649
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,100
Why are you saving me?

650
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,860
The love hidden behind the curtain

651
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,820
is always unreachable.

652
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,460
I'll be silent for the rest of my life.

653
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,460
I'll be helpless.

654
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,140
Dr. Lin,

655
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
you're awake.

656
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
I'll go find you now.

657
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,060
I'll be silent for the rest of my life.

658
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,640
I'll protect you from the

659
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,580
torrent of life.

660
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
Jin Xia.

661
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Jin Xia.

662
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
I...

663
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Great.

664
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
You're finally awake.

665
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,420
Open your eyes, the north is cold.

666
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,260
The island is filled with sky.

667
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:17,180
Who has conquered the mortal world?

668
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:23,300
I'll be silent for the rest of my life.

669
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,300
You're much better.

670
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
Your pulse is also smooth.

671
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,300
I've seen through the changes.

672
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,460
I want to say goodbye.

673
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,220
It's too hurtful to say goodbye.

674
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
Dr. Lin,

675
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,460
Jin Xia is fine now.

676
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
I'll leave her to you.

677
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,380
I'll go back first.

678
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,420
I've seen through

679
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,940
the changes..

680
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Go...

681
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,000
Surely,

682
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,420
we'll

683
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,440
be without anyone.

684
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,020
Could you promise me

685
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,020
Sit down.

686
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,260
How is that girl?

687
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,740
She just woke up.

688
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,340
Father, why are you so serious?

689
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,940
I'm not that serious.

690
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,580
I'm old.

691
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,180
Today I went to the face-off.

692
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,020
Yan Ge asked about

693
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,700
Yan Shaoqiong's case.

694
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,900
We couldn't get any evidence to prove his innocence.

695
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,700
His Majesty scolded us.

696
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,260
So he ordered to let go of Yan Shaoqiong.

697
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,260
In this way,

698
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,900
Yan's words are more arrogant.

699
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,980
Young Master, Yuan Jinxia is awake.

700
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,140
Yan Shaoqiong

701
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,700
She is so hard-working.

702
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,220
She's alive.

703
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,460
I believe Lu Yi will never expect

704
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,620
that after she wakes up,

705
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,380
her feeling

706
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,420
will be changed very much.

707
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,620
Young Master, Yan Shaoqiong was released.

708
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,820
Do you want me to settle him?

709
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,100
Call her here.

710
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,580
I want to ask her.

711
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,580
If she really wants to betray us,

712
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
I won't let her off.

713
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,580
Yes.

714
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,260
What are you doing?

715
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,820
You're here.

716
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm making pork liver porridge for Jin Xia.

717
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,620
She's bled so much.

718
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,460
She'll recover faster if she eats more pork liver.

719
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,300
Sometimes I care about her.

720
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,020
I finally found a good man.

721
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,660
But I didn't expect that it's fate.

722
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,980
That's right.

723
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,300
Jin Xia is usually bold and heartless.

724
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,420
In fact, she's sensitive.

725
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,380
If this happens,

726
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,580
she might feel guilty

727
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,460
and feel uncomfortable with herself.

728
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,380
Yes.

729
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,100
But I still hope

730
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,140
she can get through this with you.

731
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,900
That's right.

732
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,900
After going through so much,

733
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,580
I really think

734
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,700
as long as she's alive,

735
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,460
there's nothing she can't get through.

736
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,220
Right?

737
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,380
Yes.

738
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,660
I hope she can get out of her heart as soon as possible.

739
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,500
Yes.

740
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,180
Oh.

741
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,820
I'm making a red bean porridge for her.

742
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,020
It'll help her recover faster.

743
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,860
I've prepared every meal for her.

744
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,980
It's important to let her recover first.

745
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,700
Okay.

746
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,300
I'll help you.

747
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,820
Okay.

748
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,020
You're just like the sea of fate.

749
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,220
When I close my eyes,

750
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,300
I can see your face.

751
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,620
When I open my eyes,

752
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,460
I can see the coldness in the back of my eyes.

753
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,380
The sword is full of sweet words.

754
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,100
In the middle of the mortal world,

755
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,260
who has conquered the world?

756
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,300
The sound of a dance

757
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:53,280
does a

758
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,280
The Untamed

759
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,280
Episode 18
