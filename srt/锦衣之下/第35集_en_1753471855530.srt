What I told you to prepare

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Are you ready?

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,120
Don't worry.

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm ready.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Miss Yuan.

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,480
My lady wants to invite you to the room.

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,280
My lady, Miss Yuan is here.

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,560
You want to see me?

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,360
Can you talk with me?

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,160
This face is so handsome.

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,240
If I were a real man,

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,800
how nice it would be.

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,880
Miss Min asked me to come here.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,440
Are you just saying that?

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,120
I didn't sleep last night.

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,560
You're a girl.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,800
You should know what it means

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
to a woman when she gets married.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,680
I thought about it a lot last night.

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,240
I figured it out.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,960
In the past,

70
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,280
I was the only one who was willing to do it.

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,080
That's why we became like this.

72
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,120
I really regret it.

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,200
So I want to reconcile with you

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,280
before I get married.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,720
After all,

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,760
you're my first love.

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,640
Miss Min,

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
I hid your identity as my girl

80
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,040
and you failed to escape from marriage.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,160
Do you really not hate me now?

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Love is fine.

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,080
I don't care.

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,160
Anyway, after today,

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm afraid that we won't have a chance to see each other again.

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,440
You know that

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,760
although I'm the daughter of a rich man,

88
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
no matter how much I love her,

89
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
I can't have a child.

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,640
I can't fight for my family.

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
I can't borrow the family business to make a fortune.

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm afraid that

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,320
you'll only choose me

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,760
before I get married.

95
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
Do you still want to escape from marriage?

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
I can help you.

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,720
Escape from marriage?

98
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,920
Can I escape?

99
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,760
Anyway, I figured it out.

100
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,120
Marrying anyone is a family.

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
Women in this world

102
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,240
are always busy with marriage and marriage.

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
How many can choose for themselves?

104
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,400
You're right.

105
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
If you really want to help me,

106
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,640
then drink this cup of wine with me.

107
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
We'll be in the same boat.

108
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,600
In this way,

109
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,440
you can fulfill my wish.

110
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,080
What?

111
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
You're afraid that I'll poison you?

112
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
I hope that everything will be fine

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,200
and smooth when you get married.

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Don't worry.

115
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
When you get married,

116
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
everything will be smooth.

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
What did you say?

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,800
This wine...

119
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,600
This wine...

120
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,880
This wine...

121
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
Didn't you say that you wanted to help me?

122
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,720
Now I give you this chance.

123
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,640
Then marry Sima Chang'an for me.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,920
Chunyu.

125
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,360
My lady.

126
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
Her Ladyship said that the wedding team will arrive soon.

127
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,160
In this way, we'll...

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Cut the crap.

129
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,880
Come and help me.

130
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,840
Help her change her clothes.

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,400
Go.

132
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,560
Go and see if the lady is ready.

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,320
It's the auspicious time.

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,840
Yes.

135
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Yes.

136
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
My lady.

137
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,160
The wedding party is here.

138
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,440
Alright.

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Go to my father.

140
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,320
Do as I told you.

141
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,320
If my brother is willing to help,

142
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,960
with the Lu family's power,

143
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,160
it can be easily solved.

144
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,760
But he...

145
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,440
He'd rather I live on other people's life

146
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,640
than help me.

147
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,680
It's all because of you.

148
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,920
It's all because of you.

149
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,560
My lord, my lady.

150
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,720
Bad news.

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,600
My lady.

152
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
What's wrong with my lady?

153
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
We're all friends.

154
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,920
Just tell us what happened.

155
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,520
My lady.

156
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,240
My lady was too sad.

157
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
She passed out.

158
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,760
My lord.

159
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,680
Why are you still standing there?

160
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
Go to the doctor now.

161
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,240
Wait.

162
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,240
Min'er just passed out.

163
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,800
She'll come back later.

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
We can't delay it.

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360
But she passed out.

166
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
How can we pay her a visit?

167
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Take the sedan chair and send it to the Sima mansion.

168
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
We've done half of the ceremony.

169
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
If it doesn't work,

170
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
we'll do it tomorrow.

171
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,080
It's so sudden.

172
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,160
Please forgive us.

173
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm afraid I have to do the ceremony.

174
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,080
I think it's a good idea.

175
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,480
Do as you said.

176
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,680
What about my son?

177
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,360
Do it.

178
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,400
Have you suffered much lately?

179
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,840
I didn't do the ceremony.

180
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,040
Getting back from the dragon beacon dinner,

181
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,200
we'll all well.

182
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,040
Now we're all engaged.

183
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,720
Thank you for your concern.

184
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,120
Uncle.

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
Have fun.

186
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,320
Okay.

187
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Where is Jin Xia?

188
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Here

189
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,580
Little Miss

190
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
You'd better find a place to hide first.

191
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
If Master finds out, it will be a disaster.

192
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Okay. Go back and pack up your things first.

193
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,580
If Father and Mother find out and ask,

194
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,580
tell them you don't know anything.

195
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,580
If there's any news about Sima Manor,

196
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,580
you must tell me immediately.

197
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
Okay.

198
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
This time, there's going to be a good show.

199
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,580
I'll go and check.

200
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
Are all the memorials here?

201
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Your Majesty, they're all here.

202
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Your Majesty,

203
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,580
nothing big happened in the court recently.

204
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Let's just take the South East Sea as an example.

205
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
Now,

206
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Wu Shou Xu and Yu Dayong are both in charge.

207
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,580
This Japanese pirate has been hit several times.

208
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
He's now retreating to the sea.

209
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,580
There's no problem.

210
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Don't worry.

211
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
If that Daoist man is right,

212
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
Jiang Zhaoyi Dai is really suspicious,

213
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
this memorial

214
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
should have been presented long ago.

215
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Yes. I also

216
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
thought he might have some skills.

217
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Now it seems that

218
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,580
he's wrong.

219
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,580
I thought he was capable.

220
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
I didn't expect

221
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
he's also a person

222
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
who's good at

223
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
cheating and

224
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,580
is a good match for the Daoist family.

225
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,580
Your Majesty, please calm down.

226
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,580
I'll send someone to catch that liar.

227
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,580
Let him go.

228
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,580
You just need to

229
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,580
bring back the jade pendant

230
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
and tell him to leave the capital immediately.

231
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,580
Yes.

232
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
I'll go.

233
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Don't worry.

234
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
I'll marry you.

235
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
I was tricked

236
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,580
by someone for a year.

237
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
While no one is here,

238
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
let's leave.

239
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
It's strange.

240
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
It's not a salt business.

241
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
It's not a official business.

242
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
How could there be so many guards?

243
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
This is the land

244
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
of the Chunyu family's horse farm.

245
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
This matter has been

246
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
planned for a long time.

247
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
There must be no mistake.

248
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
Otherwise,

249
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,580
we'll be in trouble.

250
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
Don't worry.

251
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,580
I'll take care of it.

252
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,580
What are you doing?

253
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
I'm trying to cheat.

254
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Tie him up.

255
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Yes.

256
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Taoist Lan.

257
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Do you know what I'm here for?

258
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
You and the Emperor

259
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
are here to see me.

260
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
You're here to see me?

261
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
You're here to see me?

262
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,580
You and the Emperor

263
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
have been engaged for several days.

264
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,580
But there's no

265
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
strange thing happened.

266
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,580
For this, the Emperor ordered me

267
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,580
to get the jade pendant back.

268
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
Taoist Lan, clean up

269
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
and run away from the capital.

270
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
No suspicious.

271
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,580
That's impossible.

272
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
How dare you!

273
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,580
Do you suspect the Emperor to lie to you?

274
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,580
Calm down, sir.

275
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
The Emperor

276
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
won't lie to me.

277
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,580
But as for whether someone

278
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
is lying to the Emperor,

279
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,580
that's not sure.

280
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
What do you mean?

281
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
I just calculated it.

282
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
The East and South suspiciousness

283
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
has happened, but the Emperor

284
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
has been deceived.

285
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,580
You're lying.

286
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
Don't talk nonsense.

287
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,580
If you

288
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,580
don't judge me,

289
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,580
you're guilty of murder.

290
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
Do you know that?

291
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm willing to bet on the jade pendant.

292
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
I hope the Emperor

293
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
can send someone to investigate this.

294
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
If I lose,

295
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,580
you can come to

296
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,580
bet on the jade pendant.

297
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
How dare you bet so much!

298
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,580
You're so careless.

299
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,580
If you didn't wear this,

300
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
you would have run away.

301
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Sir, the bride is waiting for you inside.

302
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
Thank you.

303
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,580
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,580
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,580
I'm leaving.

308
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
Min Er Shi Hua?

309
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
Little girl?

310
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
Did you find Yuan Bu Kuan?

311
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
No.

312
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,580
That's strange.

313
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Where is he?

314
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Where is Xie Xiao? Didn't you go to find him?

315
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,580
Master Xie said he didn't see anyone for a day.

316
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Today is Min Er's wedding day.

317
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Jin Xia likes to make a fuss.

318
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Not really.

319
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
I asked the people in the mansion

320
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
if anyone saw Yuan Bu Kuan.

321
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Someone said they saw Yuan Bu Kuan

322
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
and Yuan Yang together this morning.

323
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,580
I asked him.

324
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
He said Yuan Bu Kuan asked him to bring back to Miss Min.

325
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
Princess and he are a good match.

326
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,580
I never saw him again.

327
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
When did you ask Yuan Yang?

328
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Not long ago.

329
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Yuan Yang is Min Er's

330
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
personal maid.

331
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Why didn't he go to the wedding?

332
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,580
Besides,

333
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
with Jin Xia's temper,

334
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
how could he know Min Er was forced to marry

335
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
and go to congratulate her?

336
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
What do you think?

337
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
You are not Min Er who married Si Ma Chang An.

338
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
You are Jin Xia.

339
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
Let's go to Si Ma Mansion.

340
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Why is it you?

341
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm also curious.

342
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Why did you appear in my wedding room?

343
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,580
Si Ma Chang An is not Min Er.

344
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
He is Jin Xia.

345
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
Si Ma Chang An?

346
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
Could it be you?

347
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
You can say it's me.

348
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
Lord Yan,

349
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,580
I was wrong.

350
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,580
Please help me untie this rope.

351
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
I'm not your bride.

352
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
Don't rush to untie it.

353
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
Tell me first.

354
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Since you are not my bride,

355
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
why are you here?

356
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Where is your bride?

357
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
I don't know.

358
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
I was blinded by your bride.

359
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
I was here when I woke up.

360
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
I don't know why she did that.

361
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
Really?

362
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Then why

363
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
can I meet you

364
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
wherever I go?

365
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Why do you always follow me?

366
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,580
I don't want to meet you either.

367
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,580
But who knows

368
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
you are Si Ma Chang An?

369
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,580
Let me go.

370
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
You don't want to answer me?

371
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,580
I have

372
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
a way to tell you the truth.

373
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
I have a way to answer you.

374
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,580
Lord Yan,

375
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
let me go.

376
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,580
What are you doing?

377
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
Tell me. Why are you here?

378
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
No.

379
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
You are Si Ma Chang An again.

380
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
You are hiding your identity.

381
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
You are playing tricks on me.

382
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,580
Fine.

383
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,580
What are you doing?

384
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
Lord Yan,

385
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
you are crazy. Let me go.

386
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
You are so stubborn.

387
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Since you are married,

388
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
it's normal for you to be so busy.

389
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
I'm crazy.

390
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Help.

391
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Stop.

392
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
What are you doing?

393
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,580
Lord Yan, why are you here?

394
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
What? You are here to make trouble for me?

395
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
Get out.

396
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,580
I thought you were

397
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
a good actor.

398
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
You are Mr. Lu.

399
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
You are here at my wedding room.

400
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,580
Is there anything important?

401
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
Your wedding room?

402
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,580
What about Si Ma Chang An?

403
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
It's boring in the capital.

404
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
I need to change my identity.

405
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
I'm done.

406
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Do you

407
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
care about this?

408
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
I don't care about your private affairs.

409
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
But since

410
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
you are married,

411
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
I will take you back

412
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
since you are married.

413
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
What do you mean?

414
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
I married her.

415
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
You don't have the right to take her away.

416
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
See you

419
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
that day.

420
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
White hair

421
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
of the past.

422
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,580
Lord Yan, I don't understand.

423
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,580
You are married to Chun Yu Min.

424
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Not Yuan Jin Xiang.

425
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,580
If you made a mistake,

426
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,580
you should correct it at once.

427
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,580
Don't need me to remind you,

428
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Since Si Ma Chang An's identity

429
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
is a fake one,

430
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,620
since the deceased doesn't know what to do

431
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,520
and has no profile at all,

432
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
you will have no right to exchange barter

433
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,140
to make a marriage certificate.

434
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,820
ivedering with the offender

435
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
will be enclosure.

436
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,440
Sir Yan.

437
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,520
You should think it over.

438
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,060
You're sure.

439
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,820
But do they still need to

440
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,160
draw for marriage certificates,

441
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,900
Miss Lu?

442
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
I'm quite interested now.

443
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,900
What does it feel like to let Lu Qian be a woman who doesn't care about anything?

444
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Lu Yi.

445
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Think about it.

446
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Are you really willing to tear your face apart for this little girl today?

447
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
I'm not.

448
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Are you willing to tear your face apart for this little girl?

449
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Since I'm here today,

450
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,900
I must take this person away.

451
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Yan Feng, let them go.

452
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,900
Young Master, you're just going to let them go like this?

453
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
There's still a long way to go.

454
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,900
There will be a chance in the future to finish them off.

455
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm going to the capital.

456
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
I'm going to the capital.

457
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
I'm going to the capital.

458
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,900
I'm going to the capital.

459
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm going to the capital.

460
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
I'm going to the capital.

461
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
I'm going to the capital.

462
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
I'm going to the capital.

463
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
I'm going to the capital.

464
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm going to the capital.

465
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm going to the capital.

466
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
I'm going to the capital.

467
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm going to the capital.

468
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
I'm going to the capital.

469
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm going to the capital.

470
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
I'm going to the capital.

471
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
I'm going to the capital.

472
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
I'm going to the capital.

473
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
I'm going to the capital.

474
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm going to the capital.

475
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
I'm going to the capital.

476
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I'm going to the capital.

477
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm going to the capital.

478
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm going to the capital.

479
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm going to the capital.

480
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
I'm going to the capital.

481
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
I'm going to the capital.

482
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
I'm going to the capital.

483
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
If you forget me,

484
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
I'm not going to buy you a ticket.

485
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Please go to the capital.

486
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
I'm going to the capital.

487
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
I'm going to the capital.

488
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I'm going to the capital.

489
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
My lord.

490
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
I thought I couldn't escape from that day.

491
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
But when I was about to lose hope,

492
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,900
the Lord appeared.

493
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Because I offended him.

494
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,900
Is it worth it?

495
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
I can tolerate him stepping on my feet,

496
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
but I can't stand seeing him hurt you.

497
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
I used to think

498
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
what it would be like to be with me for the rest of my life,

499
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
a woman who gives birth to a child.

500
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
But I never thought

501
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,900
it would be like you.

502
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
I'm sorry.

504
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm sorry.

505
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
I'm sorry.

506
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,900
I'm sorry.

507
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,900
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
I'm sorry.

509
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
I'm sorry.

510
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
I'm sorry.

511
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
I'm sorry.

512
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,900
I'm sorry.

513
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
I'm sorry.

514
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
I'm sorry.

515
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I'm sorry.

518
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
The Imperial Guards are the most trusted soldiers of His Majesty.

519
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
His Majesty loves the people so much, but you're so ungrateful.

520
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
My Lord, don't do this.

521
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
My Lord.

522
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
I think you should stay away from him.

523
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Now, we have both the evidence and evidence.

524
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
Do you think I'm praising you?

525
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Evidence and evidence?

526
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
So you're a person who's always on the road,

527
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
and always overcomes the dark and white.

528
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
If you want to get better soon,

529
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
give me the medicine.

530
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,900
I just hope that you can be happy,

531
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
and smile more every day.

532
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Don't be so sad all day.

533
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,900
The most beautiful thing in the world is the morning with you.

534
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
My Lord.

535
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
You can't lose such an important thing.

536
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
My Lord, don't worry.

537
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
I'll let you live well.

538
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,900
My Lord.

539
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,900
If God really takes me in,

540
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
please don't feel guilty.

541
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
I'm willing to do it.

542
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
The night is quiet like this.

543
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,900
The night is quiet like this.

544
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,900
I miss all the wishes in the scenery.

545
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Your martial arts skill may be able to go up.

546
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
We'll die together.

547
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
We'll live together.

548
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
I give you my life,

549
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
but I won't let you die.

550
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
The evil music is deep in my heart.

551
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
I just want to stay with you.

552
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,900
I just want to stay with you.

553
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
I just want to stay with you.

554
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,900
You are the winter rain that makes the world full of life.

555
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
My Lord, the bride is back.

556
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Go.

557
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,900
My Lord, I'm sorry for being so rude.

558
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
I hope you can forgive me.

559
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
About my son...

560
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Get out.

561
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Father.

562
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Get out.

563
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Do you know who I am?

564
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
You're so bold.

565
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,900
How dare you plot against me?

566
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
I won't do it again.

567
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,900
Please let me go.

568
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Let you go?

569
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
I got you back with a clear reason.

570
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Why should I let you go?

571
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
You...

572
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
I can tolerate her to trample me down,

573
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,900
but I can't let her hurt you.

574
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
I...

575
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
I'm sorry.

577
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,900
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm sorry.

583
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
I'm sorry.

584
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
I'm sorry.

585
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
I'm sorry.

586
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,900
So this is not a dream.

587
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm so naughty.

588
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
It's not strange that you love me.

589
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
That's it.

590
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Mother.

591
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Damn it.

592
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
You all deserve to die.

593
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
How dare you!

594
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
It's been a week since such a big thing happened.

595
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
The house of the framed is not reported.

596
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

597
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,900
According to my investigation,

598
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
this time it's because of the interest problem

599
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
that caused the house of the framed and the Kang County

600
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
to be attacked by the people.

601
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Because of the fight for the land,

602
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
the people were killed and less than ten thousand people died.

603
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Because of this,

604
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
the house of the framed reported to the court,

605
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
but I don't know why the memorial was not sent.

606
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
The house of the framed didn't get the reply from the court,

607
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,900
so they asked the governor of Zhejiang to send troops to suppress them.

608
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Now the matter has been controlled.

609
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
Such a big problem.

610
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
Who deliberately suppressed it?

611
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
You have to check it carefully.

612
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
You can't be lenient.

613
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,900
This Taoist Lan is really a little Taoist.

615
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Yes.

616
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
To be honest, Your Majesty,

617
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
I also asked the commander Lu to check the land in private.

618
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
This time, I checked the background of Taoist Lan.

619
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
Exactly.

620
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
How?

621
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Your Majesty,

622
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Lan Qingquan's parents died early.

623
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
Later, he was taken in by Master Yuan Ming.

624
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
He then took a break and practiced Tao.

625
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,900
After 18 years old, he left Danqing Pavilion and practiced everywhere.

626
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Although he was not very good at it,

627
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,900
he was indeed the new student of Yang Ming.

628
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
Good, good.

629
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,900
No roots, no fruit.

630
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,900
He is also a new student of the same Tao.

631
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Li Fang.

632
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,900
Taoist Lan, please enter the palace to see me.

633
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Yes.

634
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
What are you thinking about?

635
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
Nothing.

636
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
By the way, I heard from Xia'er that

637
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Master Chunyu sent Chun Yu Min back to Sima Mansion.

638
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Yes.

639
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Although Yan Shi Fan pretended to be Sima Chang'an,

640
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
that is still a clear evidence.

641
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
His parents also agreed.

642
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
So even if it was me,

643
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
I couldn't interfere.

644
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
If we go and report that

645
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Sima Chang'an and Yan Shi Fan are the same person,

646
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
will there be a turn?

647
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Have you forgotten?

648
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
Chun Yu is going to be there.

649
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,900
As long as Uncle and Aunt don't change their thoughts,

650
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,900
there is no chance of a change.

651
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
What should I do?

652
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
At least, she is your cousin.

653
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Although she is my cousin,

654
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,900
I did everything I should do.

655
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
It's fine if she doesn't appreciate it.

656
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
She even dared to hurt my people.

657
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,900
I will protect you.

658
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,900
Sir, if one day I made a mistake,

659
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
will you also be so clear?

660
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,900
Of course.

661
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,900
So you should be good.

662
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,900
Whatever I say,

663
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
you should do it as I said.

664
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,900
This way, there won't be any mistakes.

665
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,900
But Yan Shi Fan

666
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
pretended to be Sima Chang'an.

667
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I didn't expect that.

668
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Yes.

669
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
When I saw that groom was her,

670
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,900
I was also shocked.

671
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
And before Chun Yu Min,

672
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
she had already married two women.

673
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:22,040
Could it be that she had a beauty's

674
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,900
but Yan Shi Fan can't get any kind of woman?

675
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Why did he have to come to Hangzhou

676
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
and pretend to be Shanggu?

677
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
Later, he will pretend to be ugly.

678
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,900
Later, he will hold a funeral and marry a famous woman.

679
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
I really can't figure it out.

680
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
Maybe it's because of the identity of the official.

681
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Is there anything inconvenient to act?

682
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
By the way,

683
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,900
I heard that in the Pei's dowry,

684
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
there is a piece of land in the west side of the horse farm.

685
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,900
Will Yan Shi Fan take Chun Yu Min

686
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,900
have something to do with this?

687
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
What does Yan Shi Fan want?

688
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,900
What can't he get?

689
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Such a bad reputation,

690
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
there must be something behind it

691
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
that can't be told.

692
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,900
No need.

693
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,900
No need.

694
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Today, I will not give you any formalities.

695
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
My dear subjects.

696
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

697
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Today, I called you here

698
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,900
to share a great news with you.

699
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,900
I and the late Immortal Lan

700
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,900
just made a pill.

701
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
This pill

702
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,900
is for the body

703
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
and the soul.

704
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
It contains

705
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
human body,

706
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
horse's brain,

707
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
mountain's blood,

708
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,900
and dozens of precious medicines.

709
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,900
It also has the effect of

710
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
aging and losing weight.

711
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Congratulations to Your Majesty for getting the pill.

712
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,900
Immortal Lan,

713
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
you are all

714
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,900
very trustworthy people in the court.

715
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,900
It's not too much to say that you are left-handed and right-handed.

716
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Today, I got the pill.

717
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Of course,

718
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,900
I can't miss out on the love.

719
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Sir, please.

720
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

721
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,900
I thank you, Your Majesty.

722
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Sir,

723
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
this letter was sent by the late Immortal Lan.

724
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,900
Under the arrangement of Lord Xu,

725
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,900
I have received the letter from His Majesty.

726
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
I have accompanied His Majesty

727
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,900
to practice,

728
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,900
to deliver the pill,

729
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
and to make His Majesty happy.

730
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,900
Brother Lu, can you arrange the next plan?

731
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Zifu,

732
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
burn the letter.

733
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
I will do it.

734
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Yes.

735
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Yang Yue!

736
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
Yang Yue!

737
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Yang Yue!

738
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,900
Come on, eat something.

739
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,900
Eat some.

740
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Eat some.

741
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,900
Eat some.

742
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
I feed you.

743
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,900
You are eating it so suddenly.

744
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,900
If I don't ask you,

745
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,700
I only know that if this continues, you will die.

746
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,020
The old you

747
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,580
used to use a sharp knife to cut hair.

748
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,140
So many girls envied you.

749
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,820
Look at you now.

750
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,700
What's the difference between a rotten stone buried in the soil?

751
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,740
I'm sorry.

752
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,980
I'm sorry.

753
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,260
Do you want some water?

754
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,700
I really don't know if I should say it.

755
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,420
If you can't find Yang Yue,

756
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,860
you won't be able to.

757
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,220
As long as he's alive,

758
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,620
I will definitely find him.

759
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,140
Slow down.

760
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,860
Who is born to be an outsider

761
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,260
is no match for the love of fate.

762
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,660
Close your eyes, so I can see your face.

763
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,700
Open your eyes, the back is cold.

764
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,660
The knife is sharp.

765
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:46,500
In the mortal world, who has conquered

766
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,060
Sanctuary Ohua byuuu?

767
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,700
Opening up,

768
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:59,460
we discovered live humans.

769
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:06,660
Like a farewell is too deep.

770
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,700
The blood is我們 shameful generals.

771
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,700
