I'm sorry.

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,360
Although he was taken in by my master after I left,

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,720
we're in the same family after all.

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,000
When I think of these things that I don't know,

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
I feel dizzy.

62
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,200
Don't worry, Lan.

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,000
With you around,

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
you'll figure it out.

65
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,040
I believe you.

66
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,840
Please take care of him.

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll try my best.

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,320
By the way,

69
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,040
did your junior have any strange things

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
before he died?

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,560
Strange things?

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
He...

73
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,560
He said he was in poor health.

74
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
He said he had a headache and felt dizzy.

75
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,000
I thought he was a lazy man.

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,200
I didn't care much about him.

77
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
I don't know either.

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
He said he was sleepy recently.

79
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,840
He said he was tired and tired.

80
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,080
Is he better now?

81
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
San Shou and Er Pang.

82
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
They're the best friends in the brothel.

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,160
San Shou was hit hard this time.

84
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
He's still in a coma.

85
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,240
No.

86
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,200
By the way,

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,560
Master has been taking care of him.

88
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
Why don't you go with me?

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,880
Let's go.

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll go with you.

91
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Don't make trouble.

92
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,240
Wait, sir.

93
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,040
When did I make trouble?

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,520
Well,

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,960
you're always making trouble.

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,600
Okay, have some tea.

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,280
Sit.

98
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Did I make trouble?

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,680
Master Yuan Min.

100
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,720
Sir Lu.

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
How's Master San Shou?

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,320
His mind is not completely awake yet.

103
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,760
Should we ask for a doctor for him?

104
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,520
No need.

105
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,560
I know a little about medicine.

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,360
He's just a little scared.

107
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,520
It's okay.

108
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,640
Er Pang is in a coma.

109
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,280
We haven't found him yet.

110
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,400
I think he has a bad chest.

111
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,120
He was fine before.

112
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,360
Why did he suddenly...

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,520
Okay, okay.

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
He's dead.

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,200
He's alive.

116
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Even if Er Pang has a bad time,

117
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,160
he's in heaven.

118
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,080
He won't want to see you get hurt.

119
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,800
Be strong.

120
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,280
Yes.

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,080
We don't have many disciples left.

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
We can't have any more disciples.

123
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,360
Master.

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm fine.

125
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,120
Thank you for your help.

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
It's good that you're fine.

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
It's good that you're fine.

128
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,880
Help your brother to rest.

129
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,400
Okay, Senior.

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,040
Sleep for a while.

131
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,200
I think Master Yuan Min looks so terrified.

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
It's not like he deserves to be respected.

133
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,120
Maybe Master Sanshou knows something.

134
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,360
Sir.

135
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,040
Should I ask Lan Tianzi to check Sanshou's accent?

136
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,640
Master Yuan Min is always by Sanshou's side.

137
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,120
Don't go there yet.

138
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,520
It's dangerous.

139
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
corruption

140
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,560
Lord Lu cannot plugged into

141
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,760
this chess piece.

142
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I always think that going out is easy to get trapped in it.

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,360
I should let go of it.

144
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,360
You lost.

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
How can you be so sure that

146
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I won't lose the next game?

147
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Please.

148
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
That's great.

149
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
You won't lose.

150
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I'm not going to lose.

151
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Great.

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Good chess.

153
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Thank you.

154
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,360
I've been thinking about this chess game for a long time.

155
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Today, you were born with a death move.

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
You broke this game.

157
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Great.

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
You're too kind.

159
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
It's just that the person who plays is lost.

160
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
A chess game is better than a thousand words.

161
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I admit defeat.

162
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
You're too modest.

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Now, Danqing Pavilion is facing a crisis.

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
You are not careful.

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Your mentality is not comparable to that of ordinary people.

166
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
If it were me,

167
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,360
I wouldn't be able to be so active.

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm old.

169
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,360
I've been through a few decades of hardship.

170
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,360
I've been through a lot of hardships.

171
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,360
If this Danqing Pavilion is really destroyed by me,

172
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
it can only be a blessing.

173
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Now, Danqing Pavilion is in a bad state.

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
If you want to rebuild the chess game,

175
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,360
you can only rely on my Lan Tudi.

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,360
But his personality

177
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
makes me worried.

178
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Lan Qing Xuan is a person of great affection and loyalty.

179
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
He will protect Danqing Pavilion.

180
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Don't worry too much.

181
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
His personality is very naughty.

182
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I know him better than anyone else.

183
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Don't look at him with a smile.

184
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Actually, he has a thousand holes in his heart.

185
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I heard that Lan Qing Xuan is not ordinary.

186
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes.

187
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,360
He used to be a rich man.

188
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
He didn't learn much in the early years.

189
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
He made a lot of trouble.

190
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
After his parents died,

191
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
he lost all his family property.

192
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
He was robbed by the debtors.

193
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
He was left on the street.

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
When he was most depressed,

195
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I took him to the door of cultivation.

196
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
But even so,

197
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
I still can't see through it.

198
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
I can't forget it.

199
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,360
He has been living in the past.

200
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,660
He is like everyone's curse and

201
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,360
criticism.

202
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,360
That's what he deserves.

203
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
The hardest to guess is the human heart.

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,360
But you are his master.

205
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,360
I believe he will have something to worry about.

206
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,360
He is against the West.

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I hope Lan Tudi can understand this.

208
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,360
He should break through his inner self.

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Lan Qing Xuan is a smart man.

210
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
You don't have to worry.

211
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Sir Lu.

212
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I've been waiting for you.

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
This is the wild chicken I baked myself.

214
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I brought it here for you.

215
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
You are nice to me.

216
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
He...

217
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
I saw a lot of guards

218
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,360
at my master's door.

219
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
You are watching him?

220
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Yes.

221
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
You are watching him?

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Sir Lu, do you really think

223
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,360
my master did that?

224
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Before we find out,

225
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
we can't just let it slide.

226
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Sir Lu, my master

227
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
is gentle and kind.

228
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
He is a good cultivator.

229
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Since he recommended him to

230
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
train the elixir for His Majesty,

231
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
he never made any mistakes.

232
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Who would have thought that

233
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
the elixir he used this time

234
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
would be a problem?

235
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
I'm sure

236
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
someone saw it.

237
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
He was favored by His Majesty.

238
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
So he secretly

239
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
put the poison

240
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
in his back.

241
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Do you really believe your master?

242
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
He is like

243
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
a parent to me.

244
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Of course I believe

245
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
he is innocent.

246
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Sir Lu,

247
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
try this chicken.

248
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
It's very delicious.

249
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Do you know

250
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
you are being a criminal?

251
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
I am a criminal

252
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
when I eat chicken.

253
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Miss Yuan,

254
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
the master of Xie's Sect

255
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
saw something wrong with her eyes.

256
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Sir Lu,

257
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
please be careful.

258
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Don't let her be

259
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
taken away by others.

260
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Why did you suddenly say that?

261
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
You…

262
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Don't say that

263
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
you don't like her.

264
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
She can't hide it from me.

265
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Sir Lu is just like before.

266
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
He likes to be cruel.

267
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
But he is heartless now.

268
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Why are you so sure

269
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
that he will be taken away by others?

270
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
You are not Miss Yuan.

271
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
How do you know

272
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
he is heartless?

273
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Zi Fei Yu is happy to be with Yu Zhi Le.

274
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Zi Fei Yu is happy to be with me.

275
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Lan Qing Xuan,

276
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
do you want to

277
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
discuss the change of entertainment with me?

278
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Forget it.

279
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
I don't dare to compare myself to the two of you.

280
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
I like to

281
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
be nosy.

282
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
When I see someone I like,

283
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I can't help but

284
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
say something to him.

285
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
I didn't know how to

286
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
cherish the person in front of me.

287
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
So I regret it now.

288
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Sir, you are kind.

289
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I think

290
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
if you like Miss Yuan,

291
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
don't miss her.

292
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
It's too late

293
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
to regret like me.

294
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
So you are from here.

295
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't dare.

296
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I just think

297
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
sometimes

298
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
it's a lifetime of missing her.

299
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Why are you so upset?

300
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
You shouldn't

301
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
regret it for the rest of your life.

302
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Sir Lu,

303
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Three kings can win the handsome,

305
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
but not the skin.

306
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
I'm alone.

307
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm like a moth.

308
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
How can I be like you?

309
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
It's easy to be in love with someone you like.

310
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Even though you are not dead,

311
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
you still have a chance to meet her.

312
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
It's good to be with someone

313
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
who is not dead,

314
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
but still has a chance to meet her.

315
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Wait a minute.

316
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Let me do it.

317
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Look.

318
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I'm so concerned

319
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
about you and Miss Yuan.

320
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Please help me

321
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
with my master's business.

322
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Well.

323
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Is this chicken a good friend?

324
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
It's okay.

325
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
I'll take it back first.

326
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
After this thing is done,

327
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
I'll make it for you again.

328
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Well, if there's nothing else,

329
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
I'll go first.

330
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
If you're hungry,

331
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
just tell me.

332
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
The corpse is missing.

333
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Jinxia is very worried about it.

334
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
You two know her personality.

335
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
If we don't solve this case,

336
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm afraid she'll be in the Danqing Pavilion for the rest of her life.

337
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Ling'er.

338
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
What do you think about it?

339
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,360
It has nothing to do with me.

340
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
It's really interesting

341
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
that the corpse suddenly disappeared.

342
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,360
But I'm really curious.

343
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
It's strange.

344
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Ling'er, as far as I know,

345
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
the more difficult the art is,

346
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
the more interested you are.

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
How about we go and have a look?

348
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
No.

349
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Ling'er.

350
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,360
You and Jinxia are good friends.

351
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Now she's in trouble to find you.

352
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It's not good for you to go as a doctor.

353
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
It's not good for you to go as a doctor.

354
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
When did I become a doctor?

355
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
When you were in Fengling O.

356
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
In Fengling O,

357
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
people called you by your name.

358
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
I don't think you refused.

359
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Right?

360
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
All right. Go.

361
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Just think of it as a party.

362
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Can't you?

363
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Look. It's settled.

364
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Xie Xiao, let's go.

365
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
That's great.

366
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
You two go and pack up.

367
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
I'll go back to the gang first.

368
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I'll pick you up later.

369
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Go.

370
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm leaving.

371
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Ling'er.

372
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
You haven't recovered yet.

373
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Teach me another day.

374
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm fine.

375
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
What do you want to eat?

376
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I heard from the gang's brothers that

377
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Xie Xiao will be back soon.

378
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
He likes spicy food.

379
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Okay.

380
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
I'll go and have a look.

381
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Okay.

382
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
I'll go and have a look.

383
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Okay.

384
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
I'll go and have a look.

385
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Okay.

386
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Okay.

387
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
I'll teach you a famous dish

388
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
from Chengdu.

389
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Okay.

390
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
First, slice the fish.

391
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Slice the fish.

392
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
It's very important to be sharp.

393
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
The fish must be protected evenly.

394
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Wow.

395
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Your hand hasn't recovered yet.

396
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Why is your knife so sharp?

397
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
This knife is really hard to beat me.

398
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,360
But if I were to change to a real weapon,

399
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
I'm afraid I won't be able to cut my hand.

400
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
My father is often angry at me

401
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
because of such things.

402
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
What's the difference between a knife and a knife?

403
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Of course it's different.

404
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm afraid I can't cut my hand.

405
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm afraid I can't cut my hand.

406
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
I'm afraid I can't cut my hand.

407
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I'm afraid I can't cut my hand.

408
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I'm afraid I can't cut my hand.

409
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Of course it's different.

410
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
One is a cook.

411
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
One is a killer.

412
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
They have different attitudes.

413
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
One is to help others make delicious food.

414
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
One is to let others

415
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
never be able to eat.

416
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
They have different functions.

417
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
For me,

418
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
they are all the same.

419
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Then, do you want to try it?

420
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Come on.

421
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Here, try it.

422
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Have you ever used a knife?

423
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,360
I'm used to killing people.

424
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
This...

425
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
It's okay. I'll teach you.

426
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Here, tie the scarf first.

427
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Senior Sister.

428
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Senior Sister.

429
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Xie Xiang, don't misunderstand.

430
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
He's just...

431
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
It turns out that your relationship is so close.

432
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
It seems that I'm the one who's bothering you.

433
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
I'll go out for a while.

434
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
No, I...

435
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Xie Xiang.

436
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Xie Xiang, don't misunderstand.

437
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Fish...

438
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
is...

439
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Xie Xiang.

440
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Senior Sister,

441
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
do you like Zhang Yangyue?

442
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
You misunderstood.

443
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
He just taught me how to cook.

444
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I didn't misunderstand.

445
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Although Yangyue is just a small supplement,

446
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
as long as you really like him,

447
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
I will support you.

448
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Don't worry.

449
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
I'll find a suitable time to tell my father.

450
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
You really misunderstood.

451
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Actually, Yangyue is a little boring.

452
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
But he's a good person.

453
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
I'm relieved that you're with him.

454
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
But if he dares to bully you,

455
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
I won't let him go.

456
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I said we're nothing.

457
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Don't you understand?

458
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Senior Sister.

459
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm sorry.

460
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Why is Senior Sister suddenly angry?

461
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Sir Lu.

462
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
You're clumsy.

463
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
You don't know how to dance.

464
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
You don't know how to dance.

465
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Come on.

466
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Are you okay?

467
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm fine, Sir Lu.

468
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
I'll just go back and rest.

469
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Is that all?

470
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
I can only lean on you.

471
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
What did you say?

472
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Nothing.

473
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I want to be quiet for a while.

474
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Shangguan.

475
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
You're so good at thinking.

476
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Did you encounter any troubles?

477
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
What happened to graphite?

478
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,960
Learning by learning.

479
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Never.

480
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I want to know what happened!

481
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
Yes!

482
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Can you see that the graphitite is at its maximum state?

483
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,800
to feel the pleasure of being together

484
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,200
and make myself happy.

485
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,120
It's not easy.

486
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,600
You smile

487
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
so beautifully.

488
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,160
Why don't you

489
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,600
smile more?

490
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,640
I'm in charge of the small affairs in the gang.

491
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't rely on my smile

492
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,800
to impress people

493
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,280
who are in a hurry.

494
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,720
Jinxia is from a family of officials.

495
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
She's also dealing with people in a hurry.

496
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,760
But her style of handling things

497
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,040
is very funny.

498
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,160
When she was in the capital,

499
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
she could do nothing

500
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,840
whether she was handling things or working.

501
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,440
All the brothers of the Six Faction Sect

502
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
are inferior to her.

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
You all like Miss Yuan very much?

504
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,120
Jinxia is smart,

505
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,560
righteous,

506
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,480
and bold.

507
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
She never has any problems with others.

508
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,840
When she's in trouble,

509
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,680
she never gives up.

510
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,960
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
I've been dating her for a while.

512
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,680
But I can feel

513
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,160
her passion for life.

514
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,080
It's a pity

515
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,920
that we're two people.

516
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,280
She can live her life

517
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,920
as she wishes.

518
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,840
But every day,

519
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,120
I have to worry about the lives of thousands of people in the gang.

520
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,760
But it's not your responsibility.

521
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,400
You're a woman.

522
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,480
If you're tired,

523
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,320
you can find a shoulder to lean on.

524
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,440
Lean on?

525
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,400
Who can let me lean on?

526
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
Xie Xiao is still not mature.

527
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,200
Must it be Xie Xiao?

528
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,320
You can look around.

529
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,960
You have many choices.

530
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,800
You still have...

531
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,520
No matter how good others are,

532
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,800
you can't rely on them.

533
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,640
It's because

534
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,680
you had a marriage with the Xies in the early years.

535
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,160
Marry Xie Xiao

536
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
and manage Wu An Gang.

537
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
It's my destiny.

538
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,600
Is it?

539
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,400
I have something to do.

540
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,800
I'll leave first.

541
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,960
I can't get it.

542
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,560
Why do I insist on persisting?

543
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,400
This way, please.

544
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,480
Master Yuan Ming.

545
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,320
Mr. Xie.

546
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,320
Who are they?

547
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
This is Uncle Gai.

548
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,160
This is Dr. Lin.

549
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
They're here to cooperate with us.

550
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,840
My beloved disciple is missing.

551
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,600
I hope you can find the truth soon.

552
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,280
To clear the Dan Pavilion.

553
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,120
Don't worry.

554
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,280
We'll do our best.

555
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,520
Please.

556
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,880
Please.

557
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,600
Master.

558
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
I invited Uncle Gai and Dr. Lin here.

559
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,360
I hope they can help us with the investigation.

560
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,840
Help?

561
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,520
I asked Cen Fu to check the files of the Imperial Guards.

562
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,800
He didn't find anything.

563
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,520
Is the case

564
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,120
a mystery?

565
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,080
Sir.

566
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,920
Is this case related to

567
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,280
the pill that was given to His Majesty?

568
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,280
Why do you say that?

569
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,680
His Majesty used the pill given to Dan Qing Pavilion.

570
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,800
But he was injured.

571
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,920
It was a big deal.

572
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,240
People said

573
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,640
Dan Qing Pavilion was a evil plan.

574
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,160
Now,

575
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,840
Master Er Pang is in trouble.

576
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,880
He has to be punished.

577
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I asked Lan Qing Xuan

578
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,540
to take the

579
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,320
emergency department of Dan Qing Pavilion

580
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,840
for years.

581
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,240
Let's talk about it after we finish reading it.

582
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,440
I'll go now.

583
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,200
Open the door.

584
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,920
Wait for me, sir.

585
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,800
Great Xia Yuan.

586
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,440
I got the emergency department of Dan Qing Pavilion to you.

587
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,600
Thank you.

588
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,840
Sir, please have some tea.

589
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,080
효

590
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,240
Out of your evil

591
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,360
scenes,

592
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm mainly

593
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,560
Should we treat people the same?

594
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
Why not?

595
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,400
You see, we're all working.

596
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,200
I don't have tea or water.

597
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
I don't have snacks either.

598
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,800
I don't have fruit.

599
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,440
I don't even have a fruit peel.

600
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,480
You know, I'm obliged to help you.

601
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,000
I found a book for you.

602
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
I helped Lan Qing Xuan to get the book.

603
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,720
I've done so many hard tasks.

604
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,800
Should I have better benefits?

605
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,040
You're also thinking about it?

606
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Of course.

607
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,120
Is it the same?

608
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,360
What do I look like when I eat?

609
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,640
Forget it.

610
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,480
Xie Yuan Yuan.

611
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,320
What's wrong with you?

612
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,160
You're not a child anymore.

613
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
Why do you always make trouble with adults?

614
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,080
I make trouble?

615
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,520
If I don't make trouble,

616
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,280
you'll be taken away by others.

617
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

618
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,720
Do you fall in love with him?

619
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,880
Are you crazy?

620
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,120
Adults are adults.

621
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,200
How could I?

622
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,080
Yes.

623
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,080
Adults are adults.

624
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,400
That's the past.

625
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,400
Now?

626
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,320
Do you still treat him as an adult?

627
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,000
What else?

628
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,960
I'm not the one who can think of adults.

629
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,680
Adults are adults.

630
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,920
You can't leave him alone.

631
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,800
You're always around him.

632
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,400
You only care about him.

633
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,600
Do you know that?

634
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Yuan Jin Xia.

635
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Tell me.

636
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,320
Do you really like him?

637
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,280
You just admit it.

638
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,960
Admit it? You're a big head.

639
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,800
I have nothing to do with adults.

640
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,080
Even if I have something to do with adults,

641
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,400
it has nothing to do with you.

642
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,840
Why?

643
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
If you really like him,

644
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,400
what should I do?

645
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
I have to tell you about it today.

646
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,760
You're wrong.

647
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,760
Look.

648
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Lu Yi's family is the son of a official.

649
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,000
It must be dangerous for you to be with him.

650
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,520
You should be with me.

651
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,600
Although we don't have the right to do anything,

652
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,880
I can protect you.

653
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,320
Have you had enough?

654
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,280
I don't care about the person I choose.

655
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,640
It's Shangguan who is related to you.

656
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,080
Senior sister?

657
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,280
I just treat her as my sister.

658
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't have any other feelings.

659
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,080
How can you say that?

660
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,920
You broke off your engagement.

661
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,760
Shangguan suffered alone from the rumors.

662
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,240
She waited for you to come back.

663
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,360
But after you came back,

664
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,040
she didn't explain anything.

665
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,120
You owe her an explanation from the beginning.

666
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
Think about it.

667
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,360
I...

668
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,800
Jinxia.

669
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,000
I have to tell you clearly today.

670
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,480
First,

671
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,360
senior sister can't like me.

672
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,080
Second, I don't like my senior sister.

673
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,600
I can't be with someone I don't like

674
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
for the rest of my life.

675
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,400
How can you say that?

676
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,520
You're irresponsible.

677
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:55,920
I...

678
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,400
I don't believe that you don't have any feelings

679
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
because sister Shangguan likes you.

680
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,160
I really...

681
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,560
Enough. Don't say anything.

682
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,320
You should take care of your own business first.

683
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,840
Don't worry about my business.

684
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,880
I haven't finished yet, Jinxia.

685
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,280
Listen to me.

686
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,680
Ah...

687
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,200
Jinxia, don't go.

688
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,560
I haven't finished yet, Jinxia.

689
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,480
Yes.

690
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,880
I do owe my senior sister an explanation.

691
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,200
An...

692
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Go and arrange it.

693
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,320
Yes.

694
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,800
Master,

695
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,520
bird chef wrote you a letter.

696
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,360
Miss Bai 1967

697
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,640
Submissive

698
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,320
Your father gave you a tablet

699
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
And you want to change it

700
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,120
Yes

701
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,440
But Xie Xiao was too Certificate

702
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,240
He was so mercy

703
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,720
So he told his father

704
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,440
to Nvidia get rid of the Official Transmruption Agreement

705
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,500
for houses, pay off the debt

706
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,280
because he wants it

707
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,080
Since then, there is no touch Ask shamelessness

708
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,800
Y tragicowut, I have here this

709
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,160
In order that with coming hell

710
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,380
you won't know it

711
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,520
The officials are all doing nothing.

712
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,440
Even the private affairs of my Wuwan Gang are being taken care of.

713
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,920
Xie Xiao.

714
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,240
You are my senior sister who is learning martial arts with me.

715
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,400
How can I marry you?

716
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,280
So,

717
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,840
you left before the wedding.

718
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,160
Master Huin,

719
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,120
I am just a child.

720
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,960
Can you treat a child well?

721
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,320
Senior sister will only bless me from the bottom of her heart.

722
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,600
She is the person who knows me the most.

723
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,480
She won't care what others say.

724
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,880
I'm afraid she has a problem in her heart.

725
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,760
So, if you go with me,

726
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,280
she will know that we are a couple.

727
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,560
We are not a couple.

728
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,280
I know that senior sister will help me, right?

729
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,800
Now, even the person I like,

730
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,840
you won't let me go.

731
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,920
Senior sister,

732
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
I really like Yuan Jinxia.

733
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,320
Okay.

734
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,720
I know.

735
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,160
You go.

736
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,280
I didn't expect

737
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,800
that the day would come so soon.

738
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,400
Why are you so anxious?

739
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,680
Have you considered Uncle Xie?

740
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,920
Have you considered Wu Anbang?

741
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,560
Xie Xiao,

742
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,280
you selfishly decided my future.

743
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,880
Is this

744
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,760
the ending you want?

745
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,480
Miss Shangguan,

746
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,360
it's cold.

747
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,720
It's easy to catch a cold if you wear a thin coat.

748
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,160
This is...

749
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,120
I can just be with her now.

750
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,440
Have you thought it over a little bit?

751
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,080
She is my ideal type,

752
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
I will be happy,

753
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,880
but she relies more on Z Bai Cao.

754
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,680
Why are you here?

755
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm worried about you.

756
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,880
You promised.

757
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,120
I'm sorry.

758
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But she can't use it.

759
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,160
Must it be Xie Xiao?

760
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,840
Can't it be someone else?

761
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,440
Since I made the engagement with her,

762
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,560
I've been thinking about the wedding day.

763
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,800
I can have a drink with her.

764
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,000
After my father buried my daughter.

765
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Now,

766
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,560
she has been canceling the engagement.

767
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,600
She has ruined my wish.

768
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,400
If she didn't marry me,

769
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,760
is there any point of having a daughter?

770
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,000
People change in a moment.

771
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,880
Why are you so persistent?

772
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
Because my heart

773
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,200
has her own sound.

774
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,280
How can I forget it?

775
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
How can I not be persistent?

776
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Since you're here,

777
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,000
let's have a drink.

778
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Let's go.

779
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,560
Friends.

780
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
You drink it all.

781
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,200
It's said a worldly person

782
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,180
can

783
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,860
Why did I only taste one thing after drinking it?

784
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,940
It's bitter.

785
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,140
That's because you only care about Xie Xiao.

786
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Maybe.

787
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,100
If he hadn't saved me,

788
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,180
I wouldn't have only seen him.

789
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,860
I kept watching him silently,

790
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,660
thinking I could let him go.

791
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,260
When he returned to the court,

792
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,300
he saw everything I had been waiting for him.

793
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,220
He was happy.

794
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,300
I didn't expect that he wouldn't be so happy.

795
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,980
I was losing the water.

796
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,740
I was shocked.

797
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,860
I was so worried.

798
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,500
I was even more worried when I saw him's sad face.

799
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,340
They all think that I'm a strong woman.

800
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
I'm the only one on Wuan Gang's side.

801
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,260
And they all think I'm very ambitious.

802
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:30,700
But she still loves me over and over again.

803
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,140
Is it because I did something wrong

804
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,900
or because I'm not suitable for her?

805
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,540
Can all my efforts prove that we're not meant to be together?

806
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,020
Okay.

807
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,580
Don't blame me for taking a wrong step.

808
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,380
I heard people say that

809
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,660
fate is un Chief God's request.

810
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,480
ettie jump,

811
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,740
anthropology of mate,

812
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,700
all dances are went.

813
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,220
the clouds getsom in the sky,

814
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,420
clouds fall down also goes away goes away.

815
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,460
The wind that blows away and flows away

816
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,780
is only in the mind of the person.

817
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,420
But the choice of this thought

818
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,940
is really bitter.

819
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,180
OK,

820
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,540
let's drink with you today.

821
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,940
Come on.

822
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:15,560
Senior Guanyin plays the First Star inside the

823
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,580
Tower.

824
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,580
Has been captured...

825
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,820
to flight.

826
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,820
Dad!

827
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,820
Xiao Xi! Xiao Xi!

828
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,620
Xiao Xi!

829
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,420
What? What's wrong?

830
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,820
Impossible.

831
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,820
Impossible.

832
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,220
How could this be Xiao Xi?

833
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,220
How could this be Xiao Xi?

834
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,220
What happened?

835
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,220
Teacher. Teacher.

836
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,620
They... They...

837
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,220
They said that this is Xiao Xi.

838
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,820
They said that this is Xiao Xi.

839
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,820
It's not Xiao Xi.

840
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
Xiao Xi.

841
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Don't touch it.

842
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,020
Xiao Lang, the murderer is so cruel.

843
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,020
Teacher. Teacher.

844
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,620
Dad.

845
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,220
