Aunt Lin

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I made pancakes

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
I always make him a lot of food when I go on business trips.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,240
You're so nice to Jin Xia.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,000
We're family.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,040
What's so nice about it?

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,520
We grew up together.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,800
To me,

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,520
she's like my sister.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,200
Your father was in a bad mood when you left.

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
Jin Xia was always with him.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
She made him happy.

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,680
Their relationship is really good.

62
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Yes.

63
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,320
My father is strict with Jin Xia.

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,920
Actually, he's the one who loves her the most.

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,560
When there's something delicious at home,

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
he always sends it to her.

67
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,920
Sometimes I think

68
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,680
if my father really has a daughter,

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm afraid that's not enough to love her.

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,160
You're neighbors, right?

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,320
Yes, we're on the same street.

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
I remember when I moved in,

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,160
I had a fight with Jin Xia.

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
She's small,

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
but she was very energetic.

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,440
Although she's not big now,

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
my father really likes her.

78
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,240
He always let me buy her osmanthus cake.

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,280
How old were you then?

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,440
Around six years old.

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,720
Jin Xia is an orphan.

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,320
Brother Yang treats her as his own daughter.

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,840
He still loves her so much.

84
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,600
He loves her so much.

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,840
Could he really be...

86
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
Aunt Lin.

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
Aunt Lin.

88
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,240
Why don't you go back and rest?

89
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,760
I'll take care of this fire.

90
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,560
When the medicine is ready, I'll call you.

91
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,280
Okay.

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,480
Just make me a bowl of water.

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,640
Okay, I remember.

94
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
I'll go and get it.

95
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,280
Okay.

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
I'll go and get it.

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Okay.

98
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
Okay, I remember.

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,640
Thank you.

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
Brother Yang.

101
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,640
Ling, what's up?

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
When will you go back to the capital?

103
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,880
What?

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
I'll go with you.

105
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,400
Yan Shi Fan is in the capital.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
If you go,

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
it'll be a dead end.

108
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
No.

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,320
I want to see him.

110
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,480
No.

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,600
It's too dangerous.

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,680
I have to go.

113
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,680
When Dong Qi Sheng took me away,

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,320
Yan Shi Fan came to save me.

115
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,480
He told me

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,920
he knew where my sister's daughter was.

117
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Why did Yan Shi Fan know?

118
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
Why didn't he know

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,880
he could keep watch on the sky?

120
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
Why didn't he know?

121
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
He was so sure

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,040
he knew where the child was.

123
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,000
It means

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
he took the child away.

125
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
Otherwise, how could he

126
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,960
not find you?

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
Don't believe him.

128
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,120
He's lying.

129
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,400
You don't believe him.

130
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,920
I believe him.

131
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,880
Yan Shi Fan can't know

132
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,800
where the child is.

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
He doesn't know.

134
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Do you know?

135
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,400
What do you know?

136
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,800
You must know where the child is.

137
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,560
Why didn't you tell me?

138
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm the only family in the world.

139
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,520
Why did you hide it from me?

140
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,840
I always feel

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
the child

142
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,520
is Jin Xia.

143
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,640
Lian Er.

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,960
Why do you think it's Xia Er?

145
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,760
It's not her.

146
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Okay,

147
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
you won't believe me.

148
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,880
NATO stretched for a long time

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,760
without making such utterрав Setting.

150
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,640
Yao Ye, how was he

151
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,920
controlling the latter?

152
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,080
Your Majesty,

153
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,160
I heard that

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,640
NATO has not

155
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,760
barricaded peace injured in its borders.

156
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,880
Soост Theft

157
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
The imperial jade thought it was peaceful.

158
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,880
So they let the general in the post of the guard.

159
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
They didn't give the post to the governor.

160
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
So Ander thought it was a chance.

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
This time, they broke into Panjiakou.

162
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
The imperial jade was also anxious.

163
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,880
So Ander didn't retreat for five days.

164
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Your Majesty.

165
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,880
This is the general who guard Panjiakou.

166
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
He is in charge of the imperial jade.

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Please check it.

168
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,880
We need to remove the governor quickly.

169
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
So the army won't be unstable.

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Secretary.

171
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Yes.

172
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
What do you think?

173
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
The imperial jade failed to control the army.

174
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
It's hard to escape from the crime.

175
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Please give the imperial edict to the governor.

176
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Minister Xu.

177
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
What do you think?

178
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Your Majesty.

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
The most important thing now is to change the post.

180
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,880
So the general who can control Ander can drive Ander out of Panjiakou.

181
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Li Fang.

182
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Yes.

183
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Give the edict to Yang Mo.

184
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Tell him to replace the governor of Jiliao.

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
And drive Ander out of Luanhe.

186
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
The imperial jade is withdrawn.

187
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
It's up to the Ministry of Justice to judge.

188
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Yes.

189
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Xie Yun.

190
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Your leg is not recovered yet.

191
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Why don't you lie on the bed and lie here?

192
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Come on.

193
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Eat the cake.

194
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
I can't.

195
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
It smells so good.

196
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
You smell it.

197
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
I made it myself.

198
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
If you don't eat it, I will.

199
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
You eat it.

200
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
What's wrong with you?

201
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I heard from sister Shangguan that you didn't eat yesterday.

202
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Are you sick?

203
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
I have a heartache.

204
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Sister told me.

205
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Sister Shangguan told you about me and minister Lu?

206
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Why did you choose him?

207
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Am I not good to you?

208
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Yes.

209
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
You are good to me.

210
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I am good to you, too.

211
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Look, I brought you the cake.

212
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Since I am good to you, you are good to me, too.

213
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Why can't we be together?

214
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
I am good to Dayang.

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Dayang is good to me, too.

216
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Why can't I be with him?

217
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Because you are my brothers.

218
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Brothers are different from those who love each other.

219
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
I only like minister Lu.

220
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
There are no grass in the world.

221
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Why do you love Yuan Jinjia?

222
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
Xie Xiao.

223
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Xie Xiao.

224
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
You are so good.

225
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
There must be a better girl who likes you.

226
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,880
I know what kind of girl is the best.

227
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I have promised sister to help me.

228
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Maybe we will never see each other again.

229
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
What are you talking about?

230
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
What do you mean by never seeing each other again?

231
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
I am still looking for you.

232
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
You are eating with me.

233
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,880
It's good to help me when I go back.

234
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Good men are wise.

235
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,880
I believe you can make Wuan Gang more prosperous.

236
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,880
You can do it, my good brother.

237
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
It's not good to eat it when it's cold.

238
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Eat the cake.

239
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
You are so fat.

240
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
You dare to say that I am fat?

241
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
You dare to push me?

242
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
I will take care of you when you eat.

243
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
You can eat with me.

244
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Why are you so heavy?

245
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Who told you to eat so much?

246
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
I am really fat.

247
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
You are fat.

248
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
I am not fat.

249
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
I am not fat.

250
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
You are fat.

251
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
You are fat.

252
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
You are fat.

253
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
I am not fat.

254
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Don't pull my braid.

255
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Yuan Dexia.

256
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Are you okay?

257
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Stop talking.

258
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Leave now.

259
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Hold on.

260
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
It's useless to be painful.

261
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
I see that you are badly hurt.

262
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Let me apply some ointment.

263
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Brother and the one I love are different.

264
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
I only like Mr. Lu.

265
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,880
It's actually the one you like.

266
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,880
I wish you happiness.

267
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
But I am really worried.

268
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,880
It's the one we knew before.

269
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
It's my Jin Xia.

270
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
I am sorry.

271
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
I am sorry.

272
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Jin Xia.

273
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
This damn Huang Yue.

274
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
How dare he lie to me.

275
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
It's good that

276
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Handa invaded the northern border.

277
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
This guy let him enter the Dali Temple.

278
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Since he entered,

279
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
he doesn't want to come out.

280
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
If anyone enters the prison of Dali Temple,

281
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
whether he lives or dies,

282
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
it's just a word from the old man.

283
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
But the emperor wants to

284
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
send Yang Mo to the capital.

285
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
He is your big trouble.

286
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
If the emperor

287
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
sends him to the capital,

288
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
he will be a strong opponent in the future.

289
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
I won't let him go back to the capital.

290
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I will guard the border.

291
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Then let him stay there.

292
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
He wants to go back to the capital.

293
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Wait for him.

294
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Yes, I will find a way

295
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
to make the emperor stop thinking about it.

296
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Okay, okay.

297
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Listen to me.

298
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Okay.

299
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Aunt Lin.

300
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
What's the matter?

301
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Come on.

302
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Try this dress.

303
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
This dress...

304
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
I made it for you.

305
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Aunt Lin, why are you so nice?

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Because I am your aunt Lin.

307
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
I should be nice to you.

308
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
From now on,

309
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,880
I will take care of you from head to toe.

310
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
What's this?

311
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
This is the white of the seven sons.

312
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
It's made of white bamboo, white paper,

313
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
white chicken, white lotus,

314
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
white spoon, white fuling, white silkworm,

315
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
seven important herbs, and powder.

316
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
It's good for your face.

317
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
It's good for your beauty and beauty.

318
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Aunt Lin,

319
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
you have so many amazing methods.

320
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
I remember you washed my hair

321
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
with chicken milk

322
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
last time in Fengling.

323
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
It's so comfortable.

324
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
It's comfortable.

325
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
It's the most comfortable time

326
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I ever washed my hair.

327
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I will wash it for you in the future.

328
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
No, no, no.

329
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
It's a waste.

330
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
If I wash it,

331
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
my hair will be wet.

332
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Remember,

333
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
you are a girl.

334
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Although you are from a high-ranking family,

335
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
you can't break the rules of a girl's family.

336
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I will write the prescription for you.

337
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
You should go to do it often.

338
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
No, no, no.

339
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Thank you, Aunt Lin.

340
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
But I usually

341
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
finish the work early and come back late.

342
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
I don't have time to do this.

343
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Okay.

344
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Look at your hair.

345
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
It's messy.

346
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I will comb it for you.

347
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
No, no, no.

348
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Thank you, Aunt Lin.

349
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I remember

350
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Mr. Lu asked me to do something.

351
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I will go first.

352
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Thank you.

353
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Be careful.

354
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Don't be angry.

355
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
You will look like a girl when you walk.

356
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I know.

357
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Where are you going?

358
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
I will show you something interesting.

359
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
What interesting thing?

360
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
You will know when you go there.

361
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Is it a living thing or a dead thing?

362
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Living thing.

363
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Is it a fur or a fur?

364
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
A fur.

365
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Is it a two-legged or a four-legged?

366
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
You will know when you go there.

367
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Is it a four-legged or a two-legged?

368
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
A four-legged.

369
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Does it have feet on its head?

370
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
I told you.

371
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
It's a four-legged.

372
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
It's a four-legged.

373
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
It's a four-legged.

374
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
It's a four-legged.

375
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Does it have feet on its head?

376
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
You will know when you go there.

377
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Does it have feet on its head?

378
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
You will know when you go there.

379
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
This is the white deer I mentioned.

380
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
So beautiful.

381
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
It's so white.

382
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Even its horns are white.

383
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
It's really eye-opening.

384
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
But it's not good to capture the white deer.

385
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Mr. Lu, what did you do?

386
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
When the soldiers found it,

387
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
they didn't dare to use the beast's claws.

388
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
They only used a little bit of the small range

389
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
to capture it.

390
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
So you see,

391
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
it doesn't have any wounds on its body.

392
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
It's just that it was frightened

393
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
and didn't want to eat it.

394
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Then I'll feed it.

395
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Mr. Lu,

396
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm a god's help.

397
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
I'll write a memorial to His Majesty

398
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
to offer the white deer.

399
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Mr. Wu,

400
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
you can't write this memorial.

401
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Why not?

402
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
This white deer,

403
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
after all,

404
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
it's just a beast.

405
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
If you want to make His Majesty

406
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
feel sorry for it,

407
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
you must write some beautiful words.

408
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Right.

409
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
You see, I'm so anxious.

410
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
This memorial

411
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
must be written by someone

412
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
who is talented.

413
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
I'm a dark-skinned butterfly

414
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
who is in the right path.

415
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,880
I'm a group of lost deer

416
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
with a special kind.

417
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
I was born in the year 1000.

418
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm the best in the West.

419
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
I'm the best in the world.

420
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
I'm a fairy.

421
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
I'm the bridge of the city.

422
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm the snow-white hair.

423
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
I'm the silver wave in the island.

424
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
I'm the fine ice.

425
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm the star in the sky.

426
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm the sign of the gods.

427
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
I'm the fish in the river.

428
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Come on, take it.

429
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Let me see it.

430
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Come on.

431
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Good.

432
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
The white deer is really

433
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
a beauty.

434
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I want to see

435
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
that beast as soon as possible.

436
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Wu Shou Xu

437
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
has done a great service to the white deer.

438
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
I must reward him.

439
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Li Fang.

440
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Yes.

441
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Send my order

442
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
to send the white deer

443
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
to the capital.

444
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Yes.

445
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Zeng Feng.

446
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Tell Yang and Jin Xia

447
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
to pack up.

448
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
We're going back to the capital.

449
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Yes.

450
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Sir.

451
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
We're going back to the capital.

452
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Yes.

453
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
I just received the order

454
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
to send the white deer back to the capital.

455
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Great.

456
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I can finally go home.

457
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Think about this deer.

458
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
We've been through

459
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
so many hardships.

460
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
But I've gained a lot.

461
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Sir.

462
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
What did you gain this time?

463
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
You.

464
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
What's your regret?

465
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
I thought

466
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
if I had a chance

467
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
to go to Jiangnan,

468
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
I could find my missing family.

469
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
But

470
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
I still have no chance to find Xu.

471
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Thank you, grandpa.

472
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Yuan Daxia.

473
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Can I hug you

474
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
before you leave?

475
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Take it as a brotherly love.

476
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Xie Yuanyuan.

477
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Just like what you said.

478
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Go back and manage the Wu'an Gang.

479
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Don't worry.

480
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
I will

481
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
make the Wu'an Gang a big success.

482
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
I will set the division

483
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
into the capital

484
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
and become the top gang

485
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
in the Ming Dynasty.

486
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
I'll wait for you in the capital.

487
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Okay.

488
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Sir.

489
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Master.

490
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Shu Yi.

491
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
I'm here.

492
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm here.

493
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm here.

494
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm here.

495
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
How is it?

496
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
You've said goodbye?

497
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Lu Yi.

498
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Although you took away Jinxia

499
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
before me,

500
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
I'm not satisfied.

501
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
But I didn't give up on her.

502
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
If one day you let me know

503
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
that you didn't treat her well,

504
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
I'll take her back first.

505
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Don't worry.

506
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I won't give you this chance.

507
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Sir Lu.

508
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Yue'er is almost ready.

509
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Let's go.

510
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Okay.

511
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Let's go.

512
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Take care.

513
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Okay.

514
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
It's done.

515
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
They're watching.

516
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
My father has promised me

517
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
that he would go to Yangzhou

518
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
to propose the marriage

519
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
after he's prepared for the wedding.

520
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
I'll be prepared as soon as possible.

521
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
I'll take my wife with me.

522
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Okay.

523
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
You send Xie Xiao back to Yangzhou to heal.

524
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
I'll stay with you

525
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
and take care of myself.

526
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Do you understand?

527
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
I understand.

528
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
And...

529
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Wait for me.

530
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Okay.

531
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I'll wait for you.

532
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Shangguan.

533
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Jingxuan.

534
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Dr. Lin.

535
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Are you sure you want to go back to the capital?

536
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Do you want to consider

537
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
about our Dr. Wang Que?

538
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
I've decided that

539
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
the good things

540
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
will never change.

541
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Thank you, Shangguan.

542
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
What about you, Senior?

543
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Shangguan.

544
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm happy

545
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
to be with you.

546
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
But I know that

547
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
you're not happy

548
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
to see me.

549
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
I know

550
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I'll go wherever you go.

551
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
So you should take care of yourself.

552
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
We'll meet again

553
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
in the martial arts world.

554
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay.

555
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Uncle Yang.

556
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Take care of yourself.

557
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Okay.

558
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Xie.

559
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
After you go back to Yangzhou,

560
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
take good care of Xiao'er.

561
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Tell her

562
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
not to be so willful.

563
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Her father is not well.

564
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Stay with her at home.

565
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Okay.

566
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Jingxia.

567
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Mr. Lu.

568
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Take care.

569
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
You too.

570
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Sister Shangguan.

571
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
If you're free,

572
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
come to the capital to play with me.

573
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay.

574
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Okay.

575
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Let's go.

576
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
We're leaving.

577
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Take care.

578
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Go.

579
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
We're leaving.

580
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Go.

581
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Go.

582
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Master.

583
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Luo Wenlong is back in the capital.

584
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Master.

585
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
I'm back.

586
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
Did you handle

587
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
the thing in Hangzhou?

588
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Don't worry.

589
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
When I left,

590
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I burned all the information

591
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
about Mao Haifeng.

592
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
I couldn't find the ashes.

593
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Lu Yi

594
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
didn't want to find out

595
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
that you had any contact.

596
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
There won't be any mistake, right?

597
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Absolutely not.

598
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Master.

599
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
You don't suspect me, do you?

600
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
I'm loyal to you.

601
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
I can see it.

602
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
I won't betray you.

603
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
When I was in Hangzhou,

604
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
the women of Qi Weigang

605
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
were strict with me.

606
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
I didn't say anything.

607
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
You must believe me.

608
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Get up.

609
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
I believe you.

610
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Thank you, Master.

611
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
They're really powerful.

612
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,920
Just look forward to it.

613
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,920
It's going to be interesting.

614
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Jin Xiang.

615
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Your statement is inaccurate.

616
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Probably

617
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
it's not about theanking.

618
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
But maybe

619
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
somebody

620
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
in the gなんかking

621
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Of course.

622
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,080
My good grandson is so handsome.

623
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Right, Xia'er?

624
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
By the way, Lin Ye.

625
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,880
When you arrive in the capital, you can live in my house.

626
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,680
Although it may be a little boring.

627
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,880
It's okay. I can live anywhere.

628
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,080
I want to live in your house.

629
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,680
Brother Lu.

630
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,880
Xia'er's house is full of women. It's not convenient.

631
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
You can live in my house.

632
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,880
Is that so?

633
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,080
Well, okay.

634
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,880
Aunt Lin.

635
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,880
Are you really going to live in Jinxia's house?

636
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,080
What's wrong?

637
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,080
No, nothing.

638
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Just be prepared.

639
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Jinxia's mother is not an ordinary person.

640
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,080
She can't deal with her.

641
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,680
Don't scare me.

642
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
Aunt Lin.

643
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,080
My mother is an ordinary person.

644
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,680
You can't deal with her.

645
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,080
But you are not an ordinary person.

646
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,480
She will definitely like you.

647
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,680
Okay.

648
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,680
Master.

649
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,080
Then I'll take Aunt Lin home first.

650
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,680
Okay.

651
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,680
Dayang.

652
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
Take care of me.

653
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,680
Don't worry. I've already forgotten.

654
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,880
Let's go.

655
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,480
Let's go.

656
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,680
Go.

657
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,880
Come on.

658
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,680
You are wronged.

659
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,880
My father was wronged.

660
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Your Majesty.

661
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,280
Your Majesty.

662
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,480
You are wronged.

663
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,080
Your Majesty.

664
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,280
Your Majesty, please save my father.

665
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,280
Please.

666
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
Please, master.

667
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,480
I beg you to save my father.

668
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,880
I beg you to save my father.

669
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,280
My father was wronged.

670
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,480
My father was wronged.

671
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,880
Please, master.

672
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,680
Master, please be wise.

673
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,480
Master.

674
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,680
Master, I...

675
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,080
I beg you.

676
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,680
Please tell my father the truth.

677
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,280
I beg you.

678
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I beg you, master.

679
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,080
Master.

680
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
I beg you.

681
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,080
Please.

682
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Don't scare Bailu.

683
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,280
Take a bottle of water.

684
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,080
Please tell the truth.

685
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
Master.

686
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,680
Master.

687
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,680
You are going to tell the truth again.

688
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,280
Master.

689
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:10,880
Let's go.

690
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Master.

691
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,880
Master.

692
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,480
Please save my father.

693
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,880
Let's go.

694
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,680
My father was wronged.

695
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Master.

696
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,280
Master.

697
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Master.

698
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
My father was wronged.

699
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,880
Master.

700
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Please save my father.

701
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,480
Let's go.

702
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,280
Master.

703
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,680
Madam Yuan, your tofu is the best.

704
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Eat more if it's delicious.

705
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Come again after eating.

706
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,480
Thank you.

707
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
That's my mother.

708
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,280
Fresh tofu.

709
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,680
Fresh.

710
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,880
Madam Yuan, buy tofu.

711
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,880
A big one and a small one.

712
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
You know to come back.

713
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Mother.

714
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,080
Mother.

715
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,680
I know to come back.

716
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,080
I miss you so much.

717
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,280
Where?

718
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,080
Where do you miss me?

719
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,280
I'm back.

720
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:55,880
You are not satisfied?

721
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Of course I'm not satisfied.

722
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,280
You have been away for months.

723
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,480
I want to sell these tofu.

724
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,680
And go to Yangzhou to find you.

725
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Then you come.

726
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
You come to Yangzhou.

727
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I take you to play.

728
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,480
Don't coax me.

729
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Mother.

730
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,880
I want to go to Yangzhou.

731
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
I want to go to Yangzhou.

732
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,080
I will help you sell the tofu.

733
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,680
I will sell all.

734
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,480
You coax me every time.

735
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,080
No.

736
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,280
It's useful, mother.

737
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,680
I know you love me the most.

738
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Someone is watching.

739
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Give me a face.

740
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
Mother, I forgot to introduce you.

741
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Her name is Lingling.

742
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,080
She is the doctor I know in Yangzhou.

743
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
She is very nice to me.

744
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,680
She is master's friend.

745
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,080
She comes to the capital with us.

746
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,880
She will stay in our house temporarily.

747
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,680
Madam Yuan, sorry to bother you.

748
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,880
No.

749
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,080
Doctor Ling is quite good-looking.

750
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
She takes care of you when you go out.

751
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,880
She is Yang's friend.

752
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Sorry to bother you.

753
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,080
Well.

754
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
Go home.

755
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
I will cook tofu for you.

756
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,880
Go.

757
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,680
Brother Lu.

758
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,880
I am looking forward to the moon and the stars.

759
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,280
I finally get you back.

760
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,280
But this time,

761
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,080
I bring you trouble.

762
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,080
You mean Bai Lu?

763
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,080
Yes.

764
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
His Majesty gave you Bai Lu as a private servant.

765
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,080
It's a good fortune.

766
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,280
It's okay. I have my own way.

767
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
You have your own way.

768
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,480
How is it?

769
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
You are a good man.

770
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,280
You have served His Majesty for a while.

771
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,480
What do you think?

772
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,080
What can I think?

773
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,280
I am like serving the god.

774
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,680
You are really happy in it.

775
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
You are happy for yourself.

776
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,880
Of course.

777
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,480
You don't know.

778
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,480
I am using the god's name and His Majesty's trust.

779
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,280
I am just kidding.

780
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,480
I find it interesting.

781
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,280
Well.

782
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,280
When I sent Bai Lu to the palace,

783
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,880
I saw two men crying at the door.

784
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,880
Do you know what happened?

785
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,480
You mean the two sons of Huang Yu?

786
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,680
They are brothers, right?

787
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,280
You were on the way back to the capital.

788
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
It's normal that you don't know.

789
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,080
Huang Yu was sent to the Court of Judicial Review

790
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,880
because of the chaos caused by Ander.

791
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,680
You don't know the real reason, right?

792
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,880
Let me tell you.

793
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
The reason is

794
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,680
Huang Yu sent Yan Shi Fan a picture of Qingming.

795
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
It's fake.

796
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Yan Shi Fan thought he was deceived.

797
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,480
So he used Ander's incident to kill Huang Yu.

798
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,480
The brothers of Huang Shi Zhen went to find Yan Song first.

799
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,280
They cried and kowtowed at the door every day.

800
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,280
Yan Song was apparently beaten.

801
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,280
He promised to protect Huang Yu.

802
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,880
But he forced Dali Temple to close the case.

803
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
He killed him.

804
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,280
So the brothers of Huang Shi Zhen cried at the door of the West Garden.

805
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,480
Yes.

806
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,080
But who dares to challenge Yan Dang?

807
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,280
So no one dares to care about the brothers of Huang Shi Zhen.

808
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,280
As the commoner of the cultural forum,

809
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,880
Huang Shi Zhen did many things that made scholars feel sad.

810
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
He knelt at Yan Song's door every day.

811
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
He was only talking to himself.

812
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,480
He cried and cried at the same time.

813
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,280
He was so swollen.

814
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,480
He just wanted someone kind to help him.

815
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,680
What happened?

816
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,280
No one cared about him?

817
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,680
No one cared about him?

818
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,880
Who dares to care about him?

819
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
People come from the river.

820
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
The egg is beautiful.

821
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
The moon is beautiful.

822
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
The wind is beautiful.

823
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
You don't have to work hard in the river.

824
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,880
The new fish has swum to your side.

825
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Did Lin Ling and the others come to the capital?

826
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,680
Yes.

827
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Lin Ling has come to the capital with Lu Yi.

828
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,480
She is living in the lower house of Yuan Jin.

829
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,880
How is the repair of the house?

830
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,680
It has been repaired two days ago.

831
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,080
I have also finished the inspection.

832
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,280
Everything is ready.

833
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,280
It can be installed at any time.

834
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,080
Good.

835
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,480
Ling Er.

836
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,880
I hope you will like the gift I prepared for you.

837
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,480
I remember that year

838
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,280
when you were in the martial arts competition,

839
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,680
Lu Yi was at this age.

840
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,680
Yes.

841
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,680
I also remember clearly

842
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
when you promoted me to

843
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
the position of imperial guard.

844
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,480
Since then,

845
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I have been determined to be loyal to you.

846
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,680
Your Majesty,

847
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,280
Lu Qian is here.

848
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,680
Please come in.

849
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,680
Yes.

850
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,480
Lu Qian.

851
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
I, Lu Yi, pay my respects to Your Majesty.

852
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,480
Get up.

853
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

854
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Lu Qian Shi.

855
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,480
Did you give the white deer to Lady Lan?

856
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,680
Yes.

857
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,080
I have given it to Lady Lan.

858
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,280
Good.

859
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,480
Good.

860
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
The white deer

861
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,480
is really a gift from heaven.

862
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,680
You have done a lot of work.

863
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,880
It's hard.

864
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,480
I am a minister.

865
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
I don't have to do hard work.

866
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,880
By the way,

867
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,480
I heard that you have done a lot of work

868
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,680
in the battle of Cangang.

869
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,480
I am a royal.

870
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,280
I don't know where this rumor comes from.

871
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
I know my duty.

872
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,480
I want to know if you have any evil intentions.

873
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,280
As for the military action,

874
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,280
it's not my fault.

875
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,680
How can I make any contribution?

876
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Your Majesty,

877
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
you are trying to kill me.

878
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,280
You are so nervous.

879
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,480
Since it's a rumor,

880
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,880
you can't take it seriously.

881
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,480
I always give a clear reward.

882
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,680
But if it's yours,

883
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,480
don't be modest.

884
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,880
As for the reward,

885
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
just take what you deserve.

886
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

887
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,880
As for the merit,

888
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,880
it's the merit of all soldiers.

889
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
Look at you, Lu Anqing.

890
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Look at your son.

891
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,880
He doesn't like to make any contribution.

892
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,080
He is just like you.

893
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

894
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Aunt Ling, my house is quite simple.

895
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,080
You can live here with me.

896
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
I think it's good.

897
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,680
Jinxia, is this where you live?

898
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,480
Yes.

899
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,680
It's a little simple,

900
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,880
but it's clean.

901
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,680
Mom, tofu brain.

902
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
Aunt Ling, try it.

903
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,880
My mom's tofu brain is delicious.

904
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
I'm the one who should tell her.

905
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,880
Try it.

906
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,080
Sister Yuan, this house is clean and unique.

907
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
I guess you spent a lot of time to clean it.

908
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
No.

909
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
As long as Jinxia comes back,

910
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,080
it will be totally different.

911
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,280
She has been fond of sawing since she was a child.

912
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Look at the table.

913
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,480
The stool is all made by her.

914
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,280
This is stronger than the one sold.

915
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,680
She can even do hand-pulling.

916
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,280
That's all.

917
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,680
I'm just like you.

918
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,880
I learned it from my mom.

919
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,080
Where is your home, Dr. Lin?

920
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,480
I'm from Fujian.

921
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Fujian?

922
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
You came all the way here.

923
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
What are you doing here?

924
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,480
I'm here to find my husband.

925
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
Find your husband?

926
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
The capital is a big place.

927
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,080
You're alone?

928
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,480
Well...

929
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,680
No one is here.

930
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,280
Did Dr. Lin get married?

931
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Mom.

932
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,280
Why do you ask?

933
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
It's safe for them to go out.

934
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,280
They...

935
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,680
Why don't you ask?

936
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,080
Don't worry about their own business.

937
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,080
I...

938
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Dr. Lin, when I was a kid,

939
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,080
my parents left early.

940
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,280
I didn't study for a few days.

941
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,680
I didn't have much culture.

942
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,480
I was so lazy to say something wrong.

943
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,280
Sister Yuan, look at what you said.

944
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
How could it be?

945
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm afraid I'll disturb you.

946
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,680
No, no, no.

947
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
You eat.

948
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,080
I'll make you a stewed tofu.

949
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,880
Okay.

950
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
That's better.

951
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,680
Wait.

952
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,880
Aunt Lin.

953
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,680
My mom is honest and honest.

954
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
But she has a good heart.

955
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
I can see it.

956
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,680
You eat first.

957
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,880
I'll go help my mom.

958
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,880
Okay.

959
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,280
Mr. Yan.

960
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,480
Mr. Yan.

961
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,080
You're finally here.

962
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,280
It's not good to be absent from the court.

963
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,480
The pirates have reached Fujian.

964
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,880
They want more troops.

965
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Now they can only send troops from the west.

966
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,480
I'm afraid Yuan Shui can't solve the problem.

967
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,280
Father is not well.

968
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,880
All the things...

969
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
Mr. Xiao.

970
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
I'll say it.

971
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,680
Father.

972
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,080
You're here.

973
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,880
What's the matter?

974
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,280
Tell me.

975
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,480
The budget of the Ministry of War is double last year.

976
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,880
The Ministry of Revenue has a low tax this year.

977
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,880
Why do you need to pay?

978
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Mr. Xiao.

979
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
The North and South of the Northland are the same.

980
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
The budget must be increased.

981
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,280
It's indispensable.

982
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,880
The North has been used to farming.

983
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
For many years,

984
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,680
the budget of the Ministry of War has been more than enough.

985
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,080
Even every year,

986
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,880
it can be more than 200 taels of silver.

987
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
It can be increased.

988
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,080
I can't even pass this level.

989
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,480
How can I give it to His Majesty?

990
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,680
Give it back. I'll give you a favor.

991
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Mr. Xiao.

992
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,880
The tax of the Mansion of Prince Yu is very tight.

993
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,680
Should we give it to...

994
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
You should know very well

995
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,280
about the Ministry of Revenue's private finances.

996
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,880
The Ministry of War lacks money.

997
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
The Ministry of Works lacks money.

998
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,280
The Ministry of Revenue lacks money.

999
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,280
Every department lacks money.

1000
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,480
These are all state-owned assets.

1001
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,880
The Mansion of Prince Yu is in need of money.

1002
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,480
In other words, it's just a home.

1003
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,280
It's important that these are not state-owned.

1004
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
You'd better give it back.

1005
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Wu Shou Xu is now in Bai Lu.

1006
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,280
He even got the Jin Bai Lu watch.

1007
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,080
You came up with this idea, didn't you?

1008
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,080
Wu Shou Xu is so well-prepared.

1009
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,080
He can turn the tide.

1010
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
If you hadn't suggested it,

1011
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
how would they know that

1012
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,080
His Majesty wants to withdraw Wu Shou Xu from the position of Governor?

1013
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,880
He was lucky enough to find Xiang Rui.

1014
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
But if others knew about this,

1015
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,280
they would be killed.

1016
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
In the battle at Cen Gang,

1017
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,680
Wu Shou Xu was the commander.

1018
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,880
Yu Dayong and Qi Weigang were brave to kill the enemy.

1019
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,480
But they were finally impeached by the public.

1020
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
They were really ungrateful.

1021
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,480
I just suggested it.

1022
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Instead of keeping Wu Shou Xu's position,

1023
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,480
it's better to keep the people's honor

1024
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
between the two sides.

1025
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,280
His Majesty's will is the will of God.

1026
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,080
No one can go against the will of God.

1027
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,480
If Wu Shou Xu is withdrawn,

1028
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,880
someone will be the leader.

1029
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,480
As for the official matter,

1030
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,280
you and I don't need to worry.

1031
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,280
The battle between the parties

1032
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
is always one-sided.

1033
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
You'd better stay out of it.

1034
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm just an outsider.

1035
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,680
Father has done enough.

1036
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,880
Why should I be a joke?

1037
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,080
I think you're being a talentless.

1038
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Minister Yan.

1039
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Commander Lu.

1040
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Commander Lu.

1041
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Minister Lu.

1042
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
You just came back from Jiangnan, right?

1043
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
I heard you brought a white deer back.

1044
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Yes.

1045
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,080
This deer came back from Jiangnan all the way to Beijing.

1046
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,080
It's not disturbed on the way, right?

1047
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,080
Thanks to you,

1048
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,080
everything is fine.

1049
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
That's good.

1050
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm worried.

1051
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,480
If something happens to Bai Lu,

1052
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,480
if His Majesty blames him,

1053
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,080
Minister Lu will be in trouble.

1054
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,280
Commander Lu will be worried.

1055
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Don't you think so?

1056
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,880
Thanks for your concern.

1057
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,480
I heard you caught a cold.

1058
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,080
How are you now?

1059
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,480
Thanks for your concern.

1060
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,880
My father is fine now.

1061
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
That's good.

1062
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Commander Lu.

1063
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
You know that.

1064
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,880
The two brothers of the imperial family

1065
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,680
cry outside the house every day

1066
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,280
to avoid His Majesty's anger.

1067
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,480
Please investigate the imperial prison.

1068
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,280
Send the files to the Court of Judicial Review.

1069
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,280
Let the Ministry of Justice handle it carefully.

1070
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,480
In case His Majesty will be disturbed.

1071
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,880
The starry sky

1072
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,080
is hidden thousands of miles away.

1073
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Who is born out of the world

1074
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,280
is no match for fate.

1075
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,280
Close the eyes.

1076
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,680
I can see your face.

1077
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,680
Open your eyes.

1078
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
The back is cold.

1079
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,480
The knife is sharp.

1080
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,480
Who has won in the battle?

1081
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,480
No sound.

1082
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,880
The sound of the flute is silent.

1083
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,080
Fate is unpredictable.

1084
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,480
It's a change of heart.

1085
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,680
It's like parting.

1086
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,480
The parting is too sad.

1087
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,080
The golden leaf

1088
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,480
meets your white hair

1089
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,080
on that day.

1090
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,680
We read the years together.

1091
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,480
In a dream,

1092
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,880
a glance is enough to make a thousand years.

1093
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,680
The Long Ballad
