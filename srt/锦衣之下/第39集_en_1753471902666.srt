YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separated twice

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ah

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ah

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do you want?

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why did you move the grain?

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I know you don't want to sell the country

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But if you fail this time

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You will be very powerful

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So I

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So what?

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are hurting me, you know

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I did everything for the childe

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If there is any problem

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Lan Ye must bear it alone

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It will never involve the childe

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can you afford it?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I tell you

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This matter

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's better not to show any other flaws

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ah

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you dare to do anything in the future

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I will not spare you for the things I care about

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I will remember your words

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The disappearance of Lin Ling

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Is it related to you?

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Lin Ling is missing

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Since you told me to tell you

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't worry about Lin Ling

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I never asked about her

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If I didn't hear you say it today

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know that Lin Ling is missing

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Childe

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You owe me five thousand

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let your second master come out

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who are you?

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Our second master

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can see him if you want to

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who?

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Who is making trouble in my territory?

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am not a thief

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am a thief

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can't

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You can't

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's you

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Put down the knife

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Put it down

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What made you come?

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You tell me

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will go over

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How can I let you go in person?

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where is the person?

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Who are you looking for?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Shen Yi Lin Ling

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Lin Ling

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Stop pretending

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Give me Lin Ling

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
He is also looking for this person.

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
If you had told me earlier, I would have sent it to you directly.

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
At first, Miss Zhai just told me that

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,600
the Chief is going to use this person for his own good.

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
I never thought that Older Brother Xiao also wants this person.

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Since it is you who needs him, then of course, I will leave him to you.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Go, go, go. Invite Dr. Lin out.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Yes.

82
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,200
You said earlier that it was Miss Zhai?

83
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,400
That's right. Zhai Lanye, Miss Zhai.

84
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
No. We can't continue like this.

85
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
I want to go save her.

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Uncle.

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Wait. Wait.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,400
If we rush in now,

89
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,800
if Yan Shi Fan and Dong Qisheng come together,

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,200
we surely won't be able to defeat them.

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,400
Teacher is right. Uncle, don't be rash.

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
Father.

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
What's wrong?

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I was wrong.

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,800
Once I saw Yan Shi Fan, I obediently handed him in.

96
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
Then quickly save him.

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,400
If Yan Shi Fan takes him away, it will be too late.

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Senior.

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Since Yan Shi Fan came here personally,

100
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
he surely won't be easily hurt.

101
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,600
Let's wait for them to come out.

102
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Uncle.

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,400
Where are you taking me?

104
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
Go.

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
You've thought it through now?

106
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,880
I'm leaving.

107
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Yan Shi Fan.

108
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
So many years have passed.

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Do you still remember me?

110
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Yan Shi Fan.

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
You've turned into ashes.

112
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I won't forget you.

113
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Come on, hug me.

114
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
What are you doing?

115
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Let me go.

116
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Let me go.

117
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
No.

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
I finally found you.

119
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I won't let go easily.

120
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Come on.

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Let me see.

122
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
So many years have passed.

123
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
You're still so young and beautiful.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
You're the same as I remember.

125
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Don't touch me.

126
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Do you know how much I miss you?

127
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Every time I look in the mirror,

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
I see the eyes of the shrimp that you stabbed.

129
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
I will miss you.

130
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I want to take you back.

131
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I love you so much.

132
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
I miss you every day.

133
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
I want to kill you to avenge our Lin family.

134
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I really regret that I failed.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I should have put the hairpin in your heart.

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
You hate me so much.

137
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Just kill me if you have the guts.

138
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Otherwise, I will make you die without a right.

139
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I don't want to kill you.

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I must let you stay with me willingly.

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Don't think about it.

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Really?

143
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I know you're looking for someone.

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I know where she is.

145
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
What did you say?

146
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Your sister's daughter.

147
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
How do you know where she is?

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Don't worry.

149
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I'll take you to see her now.

150
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Put me down.

151
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Goodbye, brother.

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Put me down.

153
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Put me down.

154
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Put me down.

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Yuan Shifan, where are you taking me?

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Home.

157
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Let go of Ling'er.

158
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Uncle.

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Uncle.

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Second Master, they are fighting.

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Do you want to take them down now?

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
No.

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
We can't take them down.

164
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
We'll go with them.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Let's pack up and go.

166
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Okay.

167
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Open it.

168
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Aim it.

169
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Lu Yi, how can I see you everywhere?

170
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Don't you think you're annoying?

171
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Master Yan, I know that Doctor Ling is in trouble.

172
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I came to save him.

173
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I came to save him.

181
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Doctor Ling saved my life.

182
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I have to pay back.

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,200
You should know how I hurt my eye.

184
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
I also care about Miss Ling.

185
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Don't listen to the talk.

186
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Let go of Ling'er.

187
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Let go of me.

188
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200
You want to rob the land and kill the official?

189
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Lu Yi, you are so bold.

190
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Master Yan, I think you are bold.

191
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
You dare to collude with the pirates.

192
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
You are the first one.

193
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
What do you mean?

194
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Dong Qisheng has long been in Mao Hai Feng.

195
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Master Yan can bring Doctor Ling back so easily.

196
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
If you are not familiar with each other,

197
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm afraid no one will believe it.

198
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
So what if I am?

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
So what if I'm not?

200
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Do you have evidence?

201
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Master Yan, you are pretending to be Sima Chang'an.

202
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
You are pretending to be Sima Chang'an.

203
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
You are spreading the news and colluding with the enemies.

204
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Do you think you are really a secret agent?

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
You have no way to find out?

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I have to take him away today.

207
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Master Yan, if you really get involved in this situation,

208
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm afraid you have no chance to win.

209
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Please think twice.

210
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Miss, you are right.

211
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
The one who knows the truth is the best.

212
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Please help me take care of him.

213
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
You should think about what I told you just now.

214
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
You are welcome to come to me anytime.

215
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Master Yan!

216
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Ling'er, are you okay?

217
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Ling Yi, are you okay?

218
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Jinxia.

219
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
What's wrong?

220
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
It hurts.

221
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm fine.

222
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,200
It hurts. I can't use my strength.

223
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm hurt. I can't walk.

224
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Please take me away.

225
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I'll take you away.

226
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Hug, carry, carry.

227
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Everything is fine.

228
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm not lying to you.

229
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,200
You won't leave me alone like last time, right?

230
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
You...

231
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Your Majesty.

232
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Your Majesty.

233
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Yan Shoufu, Xu Cifu,

234
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Yu Liao Wenhua,

235
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Minister of Ministry of Revenue,

236
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
and some other ministers of the Imperial Censor.

237
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
They said they have important news to report.

238
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
What's the matter, my dear ministers?

239
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Yes, tell me.

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Your Majesty,

241
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200
the military ministry has delivered 10,000 grains of grains to Zhejiang.

242
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
It was controlled by Governor Wu Shouxu.

243
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
All the grains were destroyed.

244
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Zhejiang, Fujian and Huguang Governor have joined forces

245
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
to impeach Wu Shouxu to protect the grains.

246
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Please punish him.

247
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
I hope Your Majesty can decide.

248
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Your Majesty,

249
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Wu Shouxu gave thousands of grains to Xu Hai

250
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
for the purpose of winning the position of the Emperor.

251
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
He increased the number of grains to be the guest.

252
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
The money spent was spent on military expenses.

253
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
But the money was not enough.

254
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
People are dissatisfied.

255
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
If the chaos is not peaceful,

256
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
it will be a great loss to the people.

257
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
The consequences are unimaginable.

258
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Your Majesty,

259
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I recommend Wu Shouxu as the Governor of Zhejiang.

260
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
He is a man of great ambition and ability to win the people's favor.

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
He has no selfish motives.

262
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Please investigate it.

263
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Your Majesty,

264
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
as the Governor,

265
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
what's your opinion?

266
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Your Majesty,

267
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Wu Shouxu and Mao Haifeng have been at war for a long time.

268
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
If there is no news,

269
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
the people will be confused.

270
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
It's hard to convince the people.

271
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Your Majesty,

272
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I recommend Wu Shouxu,

273
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
but he is in the position of Governor.

274
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
It's not good for him.

275
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Please punish him severely.

276
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
My dear,

277
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
as the Governor,

278
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
you should be my friend.

279
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,200
You should be my friend.

280
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Get up.

281
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

282
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

283
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Doctor Li,

284
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
take a look at Jinxia.

285
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
It hurts.

286
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
It's swollen.

287
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,560
I made some Chinese herbs for you.

288
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,200
Remember to apply it every day.

289
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,280
But these days,

290
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,560
don't move around.

291
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,040
I can't move around for these days?

292
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,560
Yes.

293
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,360
It's more uncomfortable than dying.

294
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,400
If you want to be quick,

295
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
you have to listen to Dr. Lin.

296
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
By the way, Aunt Lin.

297
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,200
Did Dong Qisheng and the others bully you?

298
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,920
No.

299
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,120
That's right.

300
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,480
You have never had a relationship with Dong Qisheng.

301
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,640
Why did he help you?

302
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,880
Dong Qisheng said my medical skills are very good.

303
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,360
He wants to send me to Mao Haifeng.

304
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,240
He dares?

305
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Let him try.

306
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,200
Mao Haifeng?

307
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,520
How did Mao Haifeng

308
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,560
get together with them?

309
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,880
Dong Qisheng

310
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,160
was a shameless man when he was a debtor.

311
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
Now he colluded with the pirates.

312
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,760
It's even more difficult.

313
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,120
The matter of the robbery of the Three-Change Conference

314
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,880
hasn't been solved yet.

315
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,120
He caught Lin Yi again.

316
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,080
When my leg is recovered,

317
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,440
I will definitely catch him and tear him to pieces.

318
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,920
I...

319
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,600
Don't move.

320
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,320
I told you not to move around.

321
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,560
Why are you so upset?

322
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,560
I...

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,080
Sir, the medicine is here.

324
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,440
This is the medicine for the wound.

325
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,480
It's good for the wound.

326
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,960
It's good for the blood circulation.

327
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,320
Here, let me apply it for you.

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,360
Sir, I can do it myself.

329
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,040
My leg is hurt, not my hand.

330
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,200
Okay, you can do it yourself.

331
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,760
Okay.

332
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,200
Officer Yang,

333
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,720
everyone hasn't rested well recently.

334
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,200
I asked Cen Fu to send the food to the room.

335
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,040
Why don't we eat something first

336
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,760
and then have a good rest?

337
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,560
Thank you, Sir Lu.

338
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,200
Xia'er,

339
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,960
before your wound is healed,

340
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,840
stay still and don't run around.

341
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,640
Then you should have a good rest first.

342
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't move around.

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,520
I know.

344
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,120
I won't move.

345
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,320
Don't move around.

346
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,920
I won't move.

347
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,680
Sir.

348
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,960
This medicine must be used with inner force.

349
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,440
It can be released only when it's effective.

350
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,720
Okay.

351
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,200
Thank you, Sir.

352
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,280
You're not allowed to get hurt again.

353
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,960
Ouch.

354
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,560
It's good to be hurt like this.

355
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,760
Your hand is also healed.

356
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,280
Done.

357
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,320
It's painful.

358
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Sir, be gentle.

359
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Thank you for helping me.

360
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,120
This Zhai Lanye, she first decided to destroy the grain.

361
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
And she colluded with Dong Qisheng to kidnap Lin Ling.

362
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
What does she want?

363
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Young Master, since she is getting more disobedient,

364
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
I'll take care of her.

365
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Yes.

366
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Keep her alive.

367
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
She is worth it.

368
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Yes.

369
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,120
But that Lu Yi and that little bone-chopper

370
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
are getting more and more annoying.

371
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,120
They are born to be a tiger, not a tiger.

372
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I'll kill them now.

373
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
No.

374
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Isn't there that Chun Yu Min?

375
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Let her go.

376
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Yes.

377
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
The imperial court has a joint trial with Liao Wenhua.

378
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
From today,

379
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
His Majesty doesn't care about her as before.

380
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Liao Wenhua is close to His Majesty.

381
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
She has been spoiled by His Majesty.

382
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
She has been spoiled by His Majesty.

383
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,120
She is still ignorant and still cares about me.

384
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,120
If we can get rid of Liao Wenhua this time,

385
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,120
it will be the first step to shake the Yan party.

386
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Using the time when the juries are impeaching Liao Wenhua,

387
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
it's not enough to make her a criminal.

388
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
We need to take advantage of the chance to catch her.

389
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Is there any good way, Lord Xu?

390
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Yes.

391
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,120
But we still need you to cooperate.

392
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm willing to hear it.

393
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
It's you.

394
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
How did you know I was here?

395
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
I was just wondering.

396
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I was just wondering.

397
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Why are you here?

398
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,120
You thought Lu Yi would hide you in the small temple outside the city.

399
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
So I couldn't find you.

400
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
What do you want to do?

401
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
The Lord asked me to tell you.

402
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
If you want to live,

403
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,120
go to kill Yuan Jinxia as soon as possible.

404
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
This medicine must be used with inner force.

405
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
The effect can be released.

406
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
It's good.

407
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
You can't get hurt again.

408
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Master.

409
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Sit.

410
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
You're so late.

411
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Why don't you rest?

412
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
You...

413
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,120
What's going on between you and Lu Yi?

422
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
What's going on?

423
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
You're still trying to fool me.

424
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,120
You think you're always with him.

425
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I didn't even see it.

426
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Tell me the truth.

427
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
I'm not.

428
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,120
I just got familiar with him for a long time.

429
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,120
I keep telling you to be respectful to the boss.

430
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Do you know what it means to be respectful?

431
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
What do you mean?

432
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
It's fair to be respectful.

433
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
It's far from being respectful.

434
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Did you do it?

435
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
I and Mr. Lu...

436
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Am I not respectful to Mr. Lu?

437
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
You haven't even left him.

438
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Is this called being respectful?

439
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Okay, okay, okay.

440
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
I'll tell you the truth.

441
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Mr. Lu said he wanted to marry me.

442
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
He said he wanted to marry you.

443
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
You believed it.

444
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
You don't even think about it.

445
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
What's so good about you that he likes you?

446
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm not that bad.

447
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Why doesn't he like me?

448
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Then do you think the Lu family can accept you?

449
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I'm innocent.

450
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Why can't I accept it?

451
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Innocence is not equal to being in the same team.

452
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Xia'er, don't you think about your own status?

453
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Look at what your identity is.

454
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Can you climb up the Lu family?

455
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Marriage is not something you can do as you wish.

456
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Listen to me.

457
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,120
From now on, stay away from Lu Yi.

458
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,120
If I see you approach him again,

459
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
I'll send you back to the capital right away.

460
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Tell your mother to marry you.

461
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
No, Master.

462
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Since you don't want to,

463
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
do as I say.

464
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Don't you think about your own status?

465
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Look at what your identity is.

466
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Can you climb up the Lu family?

467
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Is it really not suitable for me and Mr. Lu?

468
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Yan Shi Fan, do you really know where he is?

469
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Senior, you scared me.

470
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
I didn't mean to scare you.

472
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Senior, you scared me.

473
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Lian Er, what's wrong with you?

474
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
What are you thinking about?

475
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
Yan Shi Fan told me that

476
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,120
he knew where my sister's daughter was.

477
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
I don't know if it's true or not.

478
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
You'd rather believe that there's a ghost in this world

479
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
than believe his words.

480
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Don't lie to him.

481
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
But if you really want to find someone,

482
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,120
it's very possible with Yan Shi Fan's power.

483
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Lian Er, think about it.

484
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:32,060
You've been in Fengming

485
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Don't fall into his trap.

486
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
I understand.

487
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Sir.

488
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Sir, you're so powerful.

489
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
But what did Taoist Lan say?

490
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Yu Dayong has been fighting against Mao Hai Feng for too long.

491
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Yan Sun hinted that his party was in the court

492
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
and impeached Yu Dayong for not defending his country.

493
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
There were many people in the court who said that.

494
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,120
His Majesty started to suspect that Yu Dayong had been in the country.

495
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Lan Qingquan deliberately told me

496
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,120
that I would be fooled by His Majesty right away.

497
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Is he from Wu Shou Xu?

498
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,120
I'm afraid he's not from anyone.

499
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
It's not easy to find someone who doesn't belong to any party in the court.

500
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
He's one of them.

501
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
He's even focused on the war.

502
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
As for the party, he doesn't care about it at all.

503
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Think about it.

504
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Wang Jiang Jing is the big brother. He cooperated with Zhang Jing.

505
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
He was appointed by Liao Wenhua as Zhang Jing's man.

506
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
He took over his position.

507
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Not long after, he joined Wu Shou Xu's pursuit.

508
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,120
He was appointed by Zhao Xun as Wu Shou Xu's man.

509
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
He won the battle and lost the battle.

510
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Do you dare to do such a thing?

511
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
I'm asking myself.

512
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,120
This is nothing compared to General Yu.

513
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
The war was at its peak.

514
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
It's fine if there's no assistant from the backland.

515
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
But there were people fighting in the court.

516
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
The people suffered in the end.

517
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
What I'm worried about is

518
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
sending the army's food supplies to the backland.

519
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,120
It's even harder to defeat Mao Hai Feng.

520
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Sir, we can't help with such military needs.

521
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
All right, I'll manage.

522
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Senior Boss, you wanted to see me?

523
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,120
I'd like you to help me with something.

524
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
What can it be?

525
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Ge V thief having attacked his base

526
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
did not work.

527
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
I've solved some problems with the silk.

528
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But it's not enough.

529
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I wonder if my cousin can do me a favor.

530
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,920
Help General Yu get through this.

531
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,920
You're my only family now.

532
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm willing to donate all my wealth to Chunyu.

533
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
But...

534
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,280
I have a favor to ask.

535
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Go ahead.

536
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,720
I know.

537
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,960
You put me in this Taoist temple

538
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,880
because you're afraid that Yan Shifan will harm me.

539
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,440
But I've been thinking about it for days.

540
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,480
It's not a good idea to hide here forever.

541
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
So,

542
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,400
can you take me back to the capital?

543
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Fine.

544
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,480
I'll ask Cengfu to send you to the post station.

545
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,680
Thank you, brother.

546
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
I'll leave now.

547
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Jinxia.

548
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Sir.

549
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Your wound hasn't healed yet. Sit down.

550
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,880
Thank you for your concern.

551
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm fine now.

552
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
I have something to do. I'll leave now.

553
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
What's wrong with you today?

554
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Sit down.

555
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
I'm fine now.

556
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I have something to do. I'll leave now.

557
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Sit down.

558
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Sir.

559
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,000
I didn't recognize my identity a few days ago.

560
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Please forgive me.

561
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,480
What happened?

562
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,000
Why are you suddenly like this?

563
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Tell me the truth.

564
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Tell me.

565
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,800
You said you wanted to marry me.

566
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Is it true?

567
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Marriage is not a child's play.

568
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
But I'm not as good as you in study and martial arts.

569
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
I'm not as good as you in family life.

570
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,800
How can you marry me?

571
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,200
You Lu family have been officials for generations.

572
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,000
But my family is just a market for tofu.

573
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,000
What does it have to do with these things if I want to marry you?

574
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
We have different identities.

575
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,200
Even if you agree, your father won't agree.

576
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,000
As long as we agree, it's fine.

577
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Don't worry about the rest.

578
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,000
I've been thinking about it for a whole night.

579
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,800
If I can marry you, I'll be very happy.

580
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,800
If I can't marry you,

581
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,600
I, Yuan Jin Xia, will also give up my life.

582
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
What are you talking about?

583
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,600
I, Lu Yi,

584
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
the only woman I want to marry in this life is you.

585
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Yuan Jin Xia.

586
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Remember.

587
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Everything has me.

588
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Don't think about the rest.

589
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,600
Why did you look so sad just now?

590
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,200
Why did you change suddenly?

591
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
Because I'm a married woman.

592
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Please sit, sir.

593
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,800
I'll be fine after I solve it.

594
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
By the way,

595
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,600
there's one thing I want to tell you.

596
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,400
What is it?

597
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
Something happened to the Chu Ying family.

598
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,400
After Sima Mansion was sealed,

599
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
because I was afraid that Yan Shi Fan would find Mi Er,

600
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
I hid her temporarily in the knife temple outside the city.

601
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Mi Er said she wanted to go back to the capital with us.

602
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I agreed to her.

603
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,600
So,

604
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
tomorrow, when I'm in the capital,

605
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,600
I'll put her in a safe place.

606
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
When I'm in the capital tomorrow,

607
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,400
I'll arrange her to live in the post station.

608
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,600
Sir,

609
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Miss Min is your family.

610
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,600
You can arrange her.

611
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Why do you ask me?

612
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,200
You're my future wife.

613
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
In order not to let you misunderstand,

614
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,600
I have to report everything to my wife.

615
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
But she framed me before.

616
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,600
If you want me to take good care of her,

617
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,800
I have to think about it.

618
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
But don't worry.

619
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,400
I won't bother her on purpose.

620
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,400
You know my woman is generous.

621
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,600
I won't take it to heart.

622
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,800
Of course.

623
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Who is my husband?

624
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,400
Yuan Jin Xiang.

625
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,200
Does it still hurt?

626
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes.

627
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,000
It still hurts.

628
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,800
It hurts.

629
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,600
It hurts.

630
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,560
Yuan Jin Xiang.

631
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,400
Yu Dayong RPM'veblowing about the field of provisions many times.

632
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,600
I went bungling to the court.

633
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,240
I'll be charged as treacherous guard,

634
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,960
But if I don't send the merit materials

635
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
ahead,

636
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,720
the teacher will be all menpools everywhere.

637
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,000
I can't run away again this time.

638
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,280
Don't forget, my lord.

639
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,520
Eunuch Lu once said,

640
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
there's no road without mountains and rivers.

641
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,360
There's a village with flowers and flowers.

642
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,840
My lord, Eunuch Lu is here.

643
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,880
He wants to see you.

644
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,640
He's right.

645
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,240
Please.

646
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,320
Yes, my lord.

647
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,600
Zhi Han, why did Eunuch Lu come here?

648
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,040
Look.

649
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,480
He's a man of heart.

650
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,920
He won't do anything to you.

651
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,160
It might be a good thing

652
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,880
to come here at this time.

653
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,600
My lord, Eunuch Lu is here.

654
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,400
Eunuch Lu.

655
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,160
Eunuch Lu.

656
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,120
Mr. Wu, Mr. Xu.

657
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Sorry to bother you.

658
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,600
Please forgive me.

659
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,680
Eunuch Lu, you're joking.

660
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,120
Please sit.

661
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Mr. Wu, I'm here

662
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,600
to tell you a good news.

663
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,560
What good news?

664
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,840
My family, Chunyu's family,

665
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,720
was killed by the

666
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,680
death of the family.

667
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,760
My uncle's family is safe and sound.

668
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,240
Although my cousin is a monk,

669
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,920
he agreed to

670
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,000
donate all the war horses and food

671
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,320
of Chunyu's family.

672
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,880
It's to solve your problem.

673
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,840
Eunuch Lu,

674
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,240
you've done me a great favor.

675
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,400
You're welcome.

676
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,760
The food and war horses

677
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,360
were not donated for you,

678
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,160
but for the Ming Dynasty

679
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,240
and its people.

680
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,600
I see.

681
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,720
What you did today...

682
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,600
I'll remember it

683
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,360
no matter what.

684
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,080
Mr. Wu,

685
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,440
I want to go to the army

686
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
with my son.

687
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,360
May I ask if it's convenient?

688
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,120
You want to know more about

689
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,200
the situation of the Japanese pirates

690
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,840
and report to the court?

691
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,280
That's right.

692
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,320
When do you want to go?

693
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,720
The sooner the better.

694
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,080
Tomorrow morning,

695
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,960
I'll go to Qi Weigang

696
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,120
to train a group of soldiers.

697
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm going to the port

698
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
to help you.

699
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,080
Eunuch Lu,

700
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,400
would you like to go with me?

701
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,760
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

702
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,280
Young Master,

703
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,440
the pigeon just sent you a letter.

704
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,280
Read it.

705
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,800
Master said

706
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,880
Mr. Lan is the new official in the court.

707
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,760
His Majesty is not concerned about the state affairs

708
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,520
but the Taoism.

709
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,760
Master wants you to return to the capital.

710
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,080
Hmm.

711
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,680
It's a small matter.

712
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,120
His Majesty is here to help the Taoism.

713
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,000
It's not a matter of one or two days.

714
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,760
Which one is not just a new thing

715
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,840
and not a problem?

716
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,240
You and father replied

717
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,480
that I would go back

718
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,560
after I finished handling the matter here.

719
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,880
Yes, Young Master.

720
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,800
Young Master.

721
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,520
What's up?

722
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
Mao Haifeng has urged you many times.

723
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,160
He wants to see you.

724
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,280
When will you meet him?

725
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,080
No need.

726
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,160
I'll go to him.

727
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,200
Go with me.

728
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,200
You're going in person?

729
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,360
I'll go to him now.

730
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,240
You're going to the camp tomorrow?

731
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,960
So soon?

732
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,280
Yu Dayong is waiting for the food.

733
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,520
Of course it will be soon.

734
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,960
Otherwise, the soldiers in the army will starve.

735
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,080
How can we fight?

736
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,080
I want to go with you.

737
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,640
You should

738
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,400
stay here.

739
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Master.

740
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,360
Uncle.

741
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,920
Jingxuan.

742
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,320
Uncle.

743
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,880
Uncle.

744
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,600
Uncle.

745
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,200
Uncle.

746
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,760
Uncle.

747
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,360
Uncle.

748
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,960
Uncle.

749
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,600
Uncle.

750
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,160
Uncle.

751
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,720
Uncle.

752
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,800
Are you feeling better?

753
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,040
I'm fine.

754
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,720
Much better.

755
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,960
Brother Yang.

756
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,560
Ling.

757
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,600
You're both here.

758
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,680
I have something to tell you.

759
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,720
What is it, aunt?

760
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,280
I discussed with my senior.

761
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,000
We decided to leave Hangzhou.

762
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,040
Leave?

763
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,960
You're leaving so soon?

764
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,440
Yan Shifan already knows I'm here.

765
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,720
If I stay in Hangzhou,

766
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,760
I'm afraid it's not safe.

767
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,920
And

768
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,080
I haven't found my sister's daughter.

769
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,600
I want to find her again.

770
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
But if I want to see her again,

771
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,840
I don't know when it will be.

772
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,680
It's okay.

773
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,960
I'll come back to see you when I have time.

774
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,680
General Yu and Mao Haifeng

775
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,000
have been fighting for a long time.

776
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,320
They can't conquer.

777
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,280
There are many wounded soldiers on the battlefield.

778
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,880
But there are not enough people.

779
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,840
If you don't mind going there,

780
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,640
it's a big help for the army.

781
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,880
Okay.

782
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm willing to go with you.

783
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,560
My medical skills

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
can be useful.

785
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,960
Okay.

786
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,680
I'll go with you.

787
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,760
Although I'm not good at saving people,

788
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I can still do it

789
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,960
as a doctor.

790
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,160
Besides,

791
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,120
there are no swords on the battlefield.

792
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,120
I have to protect Ling.

793
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,680
I'll go with you.

794
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,320
I should be able to help you.

795
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,560
You all go?

796
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,360
I'll go with you.

797
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
Didn't you say

798
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,400
you should take care of your wounds?

799
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,840
If you go,

800
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,920
we'll have to take care of you separately.

801
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,320
Okay.

802
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,320
You go.

803
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,520
Be careful.

804
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,640
I'll wait for you to come back.

805
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,960
Tomorrow,

806
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,200
I'll meet with General Qi

807
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,840
and Chen Fu.

808
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,320
I'll send the food first.

809
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,120
The three seniors are ready.

810
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,520
They'll come out later.

811
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,560
Okay.

812
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,560
Do as you wish.

813
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

814
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,680
How is the situation?

815
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,960
In the capital,

816
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,720
there are so many christians.

817
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,720
Who knows

818
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,120
about his presence there?

819
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,320
To be honest,

820
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,960
two twelve- ändwick's wife

821
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
and young 오에라

822
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,360
they might be not number one

823
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,780
select for the

824
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,120
part of the country.

825
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,120
I hope

826
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,120
I'm so happy to see you.

827
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

828
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,120
Your Majesty's virtue touched the heavens.

829
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Heaven's blessing

830
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,120
has made my heart

831
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,120
feel relieved.

832
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
It's really relieved.

833
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
At this moment,

834
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,120
my mood

835
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,120
is really good.

836
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Li Feng.

837
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
I'm here.

838
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,120
Why didn't I

839
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,120
see that firewood before?

840
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
Your Majesty,

841
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,120
that's Lord Liao's new mansion.

842
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Liao Wenhua?

843
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Yes.

844
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Good.

845
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,120
He has been working in the Ministry of Works for less than half a year.

846
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,120
He has built such a mansion.

847
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,120
But I built a new mansion in the Western Courtyard.

848
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,120
It's been a year,

849
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,120
but it hasn't been completed.

850
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,120
The place I chose

851
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,120
is good.

852
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Good.

853
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,120
Love.
