00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's wrong?

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There is

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
an eye

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The eye you see is Mr. Cao

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He got a human mask recently

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can't find him

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I have inquired

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The scent of the human mask

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
has been taken by Lu Yi

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you want to get it

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You have to find a way to get close to Lu Yi

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I am still young

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I haven't married yet

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't want to choose

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
any of your two choices

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sir

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Just think of me as a beginner

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I can't see anything

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Just let him go

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Except for these two choices

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I accept any punishment

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How did I come to be a teacher?

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's old

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How can those girls

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
have no use for him?

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is it too strong to be a knife shop?

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I really

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't move

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I just got it

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am so smelly

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I am so tired

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I am so tired

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My son is so sick

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why did you get the punishment from him?

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are so ungrateful

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You smell good

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Mom

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't come back for dinner

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I will save it for you

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are so ungrateful

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The food outside is not as good as my mom's

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's still hot

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You just heated it up for me, right?

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I know

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mom can't bear to see me hungry

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't think that

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will be fine if you slap me

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Who?

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
For Wang Meibo

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wang Meibo

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mr. Yi, the uncle in the city

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He has three children

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He is a good student

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He is from a good family

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I like the third one in his family

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But Mr. Yi

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I am afraid he doesn't like me

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are my dad

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You just know it

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who doesn't know you since you were a kid?

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are a child

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are a child

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You will be a trouble to me

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you know what people say behind your back?

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are a bad person

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Who said that?

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't care who said that

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Right?

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You are a shareholder now

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are a member of the government

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
People don't say it in person

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But who doesn't know

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My daughter is a girl

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Girls are your age

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Every time she comes to the door

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She will break the door

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But you

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You are useless

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Mom, you don't know

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The leaves and the worms in the book

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They are all beautiful

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because of the crowd

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So they go up the mountain to be good men

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They eat meat and drink wine

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't mention how happy people are

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's Meicheng

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Who wrote the book?

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who wrote it?

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Meicheng

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You are so rude

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Mom

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't want to get married

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are 18, you don't want to get married

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Aren't you ashamed?

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I only marry the one I like

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What do you mean?

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a family

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Women should get married at the age

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Have children and live a peaceful life

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The couple is like a mirror

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's the truth

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Who said that at the age

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We should get married and have children

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Women can't have dreams and ambitions

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Can't marry a man they love?

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't care if you say no

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I won't marry anyway

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will die when I close my eyes

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What do you mean?

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My mom will never leave me

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She will be with me

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My mom is the best

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She is the best

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You should eat now

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Mr.Yi's family

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The food is so delicious

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Your cooking is so good

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Or

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I am full, mom

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You should go to rest

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I will wash the dishes

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mom, you are still awake?

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Go to bed early

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Dad

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Dad

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Dad

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Ling

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Who are you?

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't come here

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't be afraid

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Can't you hear me?

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Dad

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's really you

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why are you like this?

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Dad, only by changing this face

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We can escape from the crisis

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Dad

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There are many guards outside

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They are catching you

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I am so worried about you

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't worry

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I will take you away from the capital

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's go

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Cao Kun

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Go

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Imperial Guard

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't be afraid

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I will protect you

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Go

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Dad, I won't go

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Go

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ling, be careful

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Go

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Dad

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Dad

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
How are you?

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dad

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Ling

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I am fine

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I am fine

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I hide there

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You go there

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I thought I hid myself

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I thought I hid myself

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I thought I hid myself

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I didn't expect

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I didn't expect

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You found me

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You are so good at it

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You often think

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You often think

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You often think

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You often think

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You often think

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You are smart

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are smart

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But you didn't expect

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But you didn't expect

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You met people like me

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You met people like me

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
who are good at chasing

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Master

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Put it there

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You found a man in the same shape

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He is tall

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He is tall

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He has a big ear

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Master

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He left a piece of this arrow

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He left a piece of this arrow

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
in his body

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
After putting on her clothes,

205
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
put her on the bed

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and make her sleep.

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Then,

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you can take out the lamp oil

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
that you've prepared.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Maybe you still don't know

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
that your only weakness

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is Ling'er.

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Father.

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Ling'er.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Father.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ling'er.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Where is the map?

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The map is my life-saving talisman.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
How could I have it with me?

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The map can't protect you at all.

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's just a proof.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why did you steal the map?

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
For the money.

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't think it's just for the money.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Who are you behind this?

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm not behind this.

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm just for the money.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm just a dead man.

229
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If you want to kill me,

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
just do it.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Sir.

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I beg you not to kill my father.

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Miss Yuan.

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I beg you.

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Please help me beg him.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Although my father did something wrong,

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
he was just confused for a moment.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Miss Yuan.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Ling'er.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
As long as your father tells the truth,

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
he will definitely forgive you.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Father.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I beg you.

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We don't want the money.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
As long as we can get out alive.

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ling'er.

247
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Father.

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You're too naive.

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Who is the Imperial Guards?

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I just said everything today.

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They will not let us go.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Father.

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No.

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Miss Yuan saved me.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
She won't lie to me.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Right?

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Miss Yuan.

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I won't lie to you.

259
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If you tell the truth,

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I will definitely ask the Lord to spare your life.

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sir Lu.

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:53,280
As long as you kill the little

264
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,000
I will tell you everything.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Cao Kun, you are so despicable.

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Father.

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How can you hurt Miss Yuan?

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Ling'er.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't worry.

270
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I will definitely take you away.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Sir Lu.

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How is this deal?

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You don't know what's going on.

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How can you negotiate with me?

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I only know that I will die.

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I dare not.

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Cao Kun.

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are underestimating Sir Lu.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How can you threaten Sir Lu?

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Right?

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Sir Lu.

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The truth and the life of Little Bu Kui

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
are both clear and important.

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't need to analyze.

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think Sir Lu.

286
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You should know better than me.

287
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sir Lu.

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sir Lu.

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No.

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't listen to him.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He just wants to kill one and then kill another.

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If one of us is missing,

293
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
he will have half of the remaining.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Little girl.

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I like you.

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I let Sir Lu kill you

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
just to be under the imperial power.

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I only have a sister.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You old fart.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You'd better go to the imperial palace and play.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Sir Lu.

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Hurry up.

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Sir Lu.

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Sir.

305
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't.

306
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't.

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't, Sir Lu.

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can't.

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Cao Kun.

310
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
For me,

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
your daughter is more suitable to be a teacher.

312
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sir Lu.

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sir Lu.

314
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Sir Lu.

315
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Sir Lu.

316
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Please let my daughter go.

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It has nothing to do with her.

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I should be responsible for this.

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I...

320
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Cao Kun.

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If you say it now,

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
she will have a chance to survive.

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If you don't say it,

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ling will die in front of you now.

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I will say it.

326
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Sir Lu.

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I will say it.

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was indeed ordered

329
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to be killed by the enemy.

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Father.

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Father.

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Wait.

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Father.

334
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Stop.

335
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Save Cao Kun first.

336
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Father.

337
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Father.

338
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Father.

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Father.

340
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Miss Yuan.

341
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Father.

342
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Miss Yuan.

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Your father is gone.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Father.

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Father.

346
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Father.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Father.

348
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Father.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Father.

350
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Father.

351
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Father.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I am late.

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please forgive me.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Father.

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
San Feng.

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Send Miss Cao back.

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes.

358
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Father.

359
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Ling.

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You can't be alive if you die.

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Father.

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Father.

363
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Ling.

364
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Ling.

365
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ling.

366
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Sir.

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Sir Lu.

368
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Aren't you looking for the map?

369
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I guess it's hidden.

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Do you know where the map is?

371
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Of course.

372
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I heard Yuan Bu Kui's tracking is very good.

373
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's not hard for you to find something.

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Of course.

375
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Since you're so sure,

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
please let me know.

377
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What's the good in it?

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You'll know when you find it.

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay.

380
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
San Feng.

381
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You don't need to go with me.

382
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Take care of Cao Kun's body.

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes.

384
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Please.

385
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There's a sign of moss on the sleeve,

386
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
half of it is wet.

387
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I guess he went to a place with river before,

388
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
like a bridge hole.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,060
She self-created herself to underground hall itself

390
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,820
maybe the place only has some lease

391
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,360
even taking the stairs

392
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,820
in this guard room

393
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,420
maybe it's a bit high

394
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,180
so she has to deep step

395
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,400
There is wall on her left hand

396
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,500
and the right one is leading upstairs

397
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
if i'm right

398
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,100
there must be ash on her left finger

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,680
I think he's hiding something important.

400
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I've seen it before.

401
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,440
Take it down.

402
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,680
You can't find such a thing under your hand.

403
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
It's not a big deal.

404
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,480
I'll take it.

405
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,280
I'll take it.

406
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,040
I'll take it.

407
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,840
I'll take it.

408
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,720
I'll take it.

409
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,640
I'll take it.

410
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,480
I'll take it.

411
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
I'll take it.

412
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
I'll take it.

413
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
I'll take it.

414
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I'll take it.

415
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,760
You can just take it.

416
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Sir.

417
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,160
It's enough to have Yuan Bu Ke alone.

418
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Yes, sir.

419
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,960
I really need to be careful.

420
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Hurry up.

421
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Okay.

422
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
是

423
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,880
Aching.

424
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,080
Have you

425
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Brushed.

426
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
I found something.

427
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Luckily I didn't see the fingerprints on the clothes.

428
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,240
I'll ask Cen Fu to give you the clothes.

429
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,600
Was it washed?

430
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Yes!

431
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,800
I promise it's like new!

432
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,480
Your Majesty,

433
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,960
this is the map that Cao Kun stole.

434
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,520
Ha ha ha!

435
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,280
Good!

436
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,360
Good!

437
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,320
Lu Jingli broke the case in a few days.

438
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,240
I'll reward you with any rewards you want.

439
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,720
It's my duty to serve Your Majesty.

440
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,000
I've never thought of the reward of the demon.

441
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,600
This is what Lu Aiqing taught you again, right?

442
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,080
Your father

443
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,920
is too strict.

444
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,440
Have you found out the purpose of Cao Kun's theft of the map?

445
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,960
I haven't found out the result yet.

446
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,720
Cao Kun was killed by someone.

447
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,640
But

448
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,360
I found a mysterious map

449
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,080
on the arm of Cao Kun

450
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,800
from the people of the Eastern Camp.

451
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,480
I think

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,120
Cao Kun sneaked into the army

453
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,920
to know more accurately

454
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,640
about our army.

455
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,120
And

456
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,160
someone must have helped him in the court.

457
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Even behind him

458
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,120
is a stronger master

459
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,480
who controls everything.

460
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,480
Otherwise, with Cao Kun's power,

461
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,480
how could he steal the map?

462
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,080
So

463
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,640
the pirates in the southeast

464
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,840
are not related to each other?

465
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,160
Yes.

466
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,240
This is the report of Tan He,

467
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,600
the father of Jian Zhen,

468
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,520
who took over the people's property

469
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,000
and killed his wife.

470
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,920
I

471
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,240
usually don't like

472
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,640
these royal relatives

473
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
taking advantage of power

474
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,280
to bully others.

475
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,640
You

476
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,560
take the case of Jian Zhen

477
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,560
and go to the south of the country

478
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,480
to investigate

479
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,440
the conspiracy behind Cao Kun

480
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,400
and the pirates.

481
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,120
Yes.

482
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

483
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm a six-foot-high servant.

484
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,400
Now I'm a laundry woman.

485
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,520
Xia,

486
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,160
why are you washing clothes?

487
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,240
This...

488
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,280
Isn't this Lord Lu's clothes?

489
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,040
You...

490
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,160
You two...

491
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,360
This...

492
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:10,880
This...

493
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,920
What are you thinking about?

494
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,800
I'm unlucky.

495
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,520
I accidentally dirtied his clothes.

496
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,480
Now I have to be responsible

497
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
to clean it.

498
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,360
I thought...

499
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,440
Tell me.

500
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Do you think the Imperial Guards

501
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,000
kill people without blinking?

502
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,400
The Imperial Guards

503
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
obey His Majesty directly

504
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,360
and order to patrol the base

505
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,200
to monitor the officials for His Majesty.

506
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
They also want to arrest

507
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,920
those who are evil.

508
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,520
Of course they have to be ruthless.

509
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,520
Isn't it enough to have a three-division department

510
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,320
in the world?

511
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,000
Why do we have to

512
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,360
have a Imperial Guards to protect the family?

513
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,720
I don't know what His Majesty thinks.

514
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,560
Why do we need a three-division department?

515
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,160
It's just like a false agency.

516
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,440
My old lady.

517
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,600
You'd better keep your voice down.

518
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,080
You can't say that.

519
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,880
My life

520
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,320
is almost in the hands of that Lu.

521
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,360
I can't beat him.

522
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,320
Can't I say something?

523
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,360
You're just a little bit capable.

524
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
I heard that

525
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,200
whether it's a general or a guard,

526
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,760
they all have to pass

527
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,080
the tests of many people

528
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,680
to become a imperial guard.

529
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:42,760
Go!

530
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,920
So, ANY duas?

531
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,480
If I wear this,

532
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
are you afraid of me too?

533
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
I'm afraid of you!

534
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,480
I'm afraid of you!

535
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,280
I'm broken!

536
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm afraid of you!

537
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,560
I'll beat you!

538
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,080
I'm broken!

539
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Why are you running away?

540
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
You...

541
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Father.

542
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,200
His Majesty ordered you to go to Yangzhou

543
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,680
to investigate General Feng Guo and Jian Zhen?

544
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes.

545
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,360
His Majesty is clearly stupid

546
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,440
to let me investigate General Feng Guo.

547
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,720
But in the case,

548
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,160
the person who let me investigate

549
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,560
is the mastermind behind Cao Kun.

550
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,360
You must act according to the plan.

551
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,800
This action

552
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,080
is related to the fact that

553
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,360
the royal family and state flag must not be taken rashly.

554
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,680
Yang Cheng Wan of the Six Sages Sect

555
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
is very good at tracking.

556
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
He's very useful.

557
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
I understand.

558
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,280
I really don't know if your temper

559
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,520
is with me or your mother.

560
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,200
As you said,

561
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
it's good to be like me.

562
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,320
It's better to see things

563
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
in a little bit.

564
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Come on.

565
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
Steamed pork with soy sauce.

566
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,160
Shredded yam.

567
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
I've picked all the dishes.

568
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,440
A girl

569
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,760
can't even eat.

570
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,240
How can she get married?

571
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
I won't get married then.

572
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Eat.

573
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,960
I have a new task.

574
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,240
You two prepare.

575
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
In a few days,

576
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,840
come with me to Yangzhou.

577
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,240
What task do you have to go to Yangzhou?

578
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
The General of General Feng Guo of the Prince of Juye's Mansion

579
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
is going to be the King of the State.

580
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
General Feng Guo is the son of the real father.

581
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He's robbing the property of the people.

582
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Lord Liu,

583
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
ask me to collect evidence.

584
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Master,

585
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
how about me and Dayang?

586
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Jiangnan is very humid.

587
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If you go,

588
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
you'll definitely cause trouble.

589
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes, father.

590
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
How can that be?

591
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This is a case of the Imperial Guards.

592
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You two go.

593
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Where can you keep an eye on it?

594
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Which Imperial Guards are you sending?

595
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Imperial Guards, Jing Li and Lu Yi.

596
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
It's him again.

597
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
By the way, Jingxia,

598
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Cao Kun's case has been solved.

599
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
How do you and Lord Lu make a bet?

600
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
How do you calculate it?

601
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
I found the evidence.

602
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
I can't lose no matter what.

603
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I can't let him take this away.

604
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
I have to get my hand back.

605
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Xia'er,

606
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
when you see Lord Lu,

607
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
be careful with your temper.

608
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm better, Master.

609
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Eat, eat.

610
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Dayang,

611
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
it's a pity that you're not a cook.

612
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
It's so delicious.

613
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Eat, Master.

614
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Lord,

615
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
the six gates are not quick to come to visit.

616
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Lord Lu,

617
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
your clothes are washed.

618
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Okay,

619
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
leave it to the servants.

620
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Yes.

621
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I'll go to the palace to get some food.

622
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Okay.

623
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
I'll go to the palace to get some food.

624
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Okay.

625
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I'll give this to Lord Lu today.

626
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Well,

627
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
well,

628
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
what else?

629
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Lord,

630
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
we made a bet on Cao Kun's case.

631
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Now it's over.

632
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
I'm not here to get credit.

633
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I just want to ask you

634
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
to return the handkerchief to me.

635
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
You're here to get something?

636
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
I'll think about it.

637
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
I...

638
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Lord,

639
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
although I got Cao Kun's evidence,

640
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I got it first.

641
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
But we can find it together

642
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
and give it to you.

643
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
In fact, we're even.

644
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Can you please

645
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
give me the handkerchief back?

646
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
It's dangerous for a little girl

647
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
to go out to handle a case.

648
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
She must have a protective object.

649
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I just said it.

650
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Let me think about it.

651
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
I didn't hear it.

652
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Don't worry.

653
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
I'll wait for you here.

654
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Lord,

655
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
I want to ask you a question.

656
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,280
I talked to you before

657
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Yan Shi Fan gave you the empty handkerchief.

658
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Why do you think

659
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
it's different from the previous one?

660
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
The empty handkerchief is a product.

661
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
It's a genuine product.

662
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Don't touch it.

663
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
No.

664
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
Since you have a genuine product,

665
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
why do you still want to participate in the competition?

666
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Even if it's a product,

667
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Lin Lang

668
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
can't be owned easily.

669
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Since you're so rich

670
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
and want to buy a few things

671
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
for a small price,

672
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
can you

673
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
exchange

674
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
my handkerchief

675
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
for me?

676
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
My little handkerchief

677
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
is finally back in my hand.

678
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Did he change it for me?

679
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
How can he make up his mind

680
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
to give me something?

681
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
But

682
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
it seems more convenient.

683
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
This guy

684
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
can even make fire.

685
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Let's go.

686
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Brother,

687
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
two servings of braised pork.

688
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Here you are.

689
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Do you have money?

690
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
The old rule is

691
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
to remember the old rules.

692
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
I haven't finished cleaning it yet.

693
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Ling Er.

694
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Miss Yuan.

695
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Why are you so polite?

696
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Just call me Jin Xia.

697
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Please sit.

698
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Thank you.

699
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
I followed you here.

700
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
I knew it.

701
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
If you need anything,

702
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
just come to me.

703
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
What's wrong?

704
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
My father is dead.

705
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
The Cao family is defeated.

706
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
And the thing about the divorce.

707
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Now the Liang family

708
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
doesn't want to be my friend.

709
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
I'm sorry.

710
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I'm sorry.

711
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
I'm sorry.

712
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
You're my only friend.

713
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
So I want to tell you

714
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
I'm leaving.

715
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
Go?

716
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
Where to?

717
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm in peace now.

718
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
I'm not lonely.

719
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
But don't worry.

720
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
After a few days,

721
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
the aunt in the distance will pick me up in Beijing.

722
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
Take me back to my hometown.

723
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
There are people from the Cao family.

724
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
They will take care of me.

725
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
That's good.

726
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Ling'er.

727
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
The woman's tears

728
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
are like pearls.

729
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
If you cry often,

730
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
the pearls will turn into pearls.

731
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
And you will lose its original value.

732
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Only when you

733
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
give your everything

734
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
can you get what you want.

735
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Okay.

736
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
Don't cry.

737
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm sorry.

738
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Take care of yourself.

739
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Take care, Miss Yuan.

740
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
Why is it so early?

741
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Oh, no.

742
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
I'm sorry.

743
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
I'm sorry, mom.

744
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
You can do it yourself.

745
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Mom.

746
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
You scared me.

747
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
What are you doing in a hurry?

748
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
I'm on a business trip.

749
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
I told you.

750
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
I remember you said three days later.

751
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
I made you clothes.

752
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
I'll tell Yang Putou.

753
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
You don't have to go this time.

754
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Ye Laosan's mother came in the afternoon.

755
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
She said she would come to see you.

756
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Mom, I can't do it.

757
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
I told you.

758
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I have to go.

759
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Your family is a family of scholars.

760
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
You can marry me.

761
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I can rest assured.

762
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Mom, don't be anxious.

763
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Don't be anxious.

764
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
I'll talk to you when I come back.

765
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
I'm going out for a long time.

766
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Mom, you stay here.

767
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm going to walk first.

768
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Go.

769
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
You have to be careful when you go out.

770
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
Don't break the wall when you meet something.

771
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
I know.

772
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Your Excellency.

773
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
I'm here.

774
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Are you sure?

775
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Don't worry.

776
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
I've prepared everything.

777
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Let them put the boxes in the ship.

778
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
I have to be careful.

779
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Don't make any mistakes.

780
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Yes.

781
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Da Yang.

782
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Da Yang.

783
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
I'm here.

784
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Why are you so slow?

785
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I'll talk to you later.

786
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Are you tired? Drink some water.

787
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
Drink slowly.

788
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Who are they?

789
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
That's Wang Fangxing,

790
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
the subordinate of the Central Command of the State of Zheng.

791
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
The one below is the chess player, Sha Xiuzhu.

792
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
The Central Command of the State of Zheng?

793
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Isn't he the son of General Feng Guo

794
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
of the House of the Wild King, Guan Xuan?

795
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
What a coincidence.

796
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
That's right. I heard that in a few days,

797
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
it's General Feng Guo's 50th birthday.

798
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
The Central Command of the State of Zheng ordered them to send a birthday cake

799
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
to Yangzhou to celebrate General Feng Guo's birthday.

800
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
No wonder.

801
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
No wonder the House of Wild King suddenly asked us to set out three days in advance.

802
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
They even specially asked us to wear a uniform.

803
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
So they wanted to follow us.

804
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
We can't go through here.

805
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Why?

806
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
There's no time for nonsense. Get out of the way.

807
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Why are you so fierce? This road is opened by your family.

808
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
I'm leaving.

809
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Wait.

810
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Don't cause trouble.

811
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Everyone, misunderstanding.

812
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
My character is quite straightforward, but I have no evil intentions.

813
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
We are all here to work.

814
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
There's no need to hurt He Qi.

815
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Since this road is not accessible, we can just change it.

816
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Everyone, don't hurt He Qi.

817
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Let's go.

818
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:49,740
Why did they move so many

819
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
people?

820
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
They are all here.

821
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Let's go.

822
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Everyone, stand up.

823
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

824
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Your Majesty, I'm not very observant of Cao Kun's case.

825
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
I beg Your Majesty to punish me.

826
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I think you just took over the position of Minister of War.

827
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Cao Kun is a traitor.

828
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
When we were in a mess, he took away the map.

829
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
You shouldn't blame it on me.

830
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
I'll remember this for now.

831
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
But you should punish me for your crime.

832
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I'll remember this for now.

833
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
But you should punish me for your crime.

834
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
Stand up.

835
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,460
I thank Your Majesty for not punishing me.

836
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
For Cao Kun taking away the map,

837
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,460
what do you think?

838
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
I think we can re-re-evaluate the layout of the border guards.

839
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
We can re-re-evaluate the layout of the border guards.

840
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
We can re-re-evaluate the layout of the border guards.

841
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
We can bring down the north and south.

842
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
We can bring down the north and south.

843
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
We can bring down the north and south.

844
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
We can re-evaluate the layout of the border guards.

845
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
In this way,

846
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
we don't need to worry about the foreign bandits

847
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
stealing the map of the border guards.

848
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
This is a good plan.

849
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
But the foreign enemies are very ambitious.

850
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
If there is no strong candidate,

851
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I'm afraid that we can't stop them

852
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
from trying to invade our country.

853
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
This candidate

854
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,180
is very important.

855
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I have a suitable candidate.

856
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,180
Please decide.

857
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Tell me.

858
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Huang Yu

859
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
can take this important role.

860
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,180
Huang Yu?

861
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,180
Minister Xu.

862
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,180
I'm here.

863
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
You are the Minister of War.

864
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
What do you think?

865
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,180
Your Majesty.

866
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Huang Yu is a Japanese spy

867
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,180
who is good at using talents in the southeast.

868
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
He is good at planning and changing the situation.

869
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
He has made many achievements.

870
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
If he can guard the border,

871
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
you can rest assured.

872
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Minister Xu, what do you think?

873
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Your Majesty.

874
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Huang Yu is experienced.

875
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
He is the best candidate.

876
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Since you three

877
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
think that Huang Yu

878
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
can take this important role.

879
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Li Fang.

880
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,900
I'm here.

881
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Send an edict immediately.

882
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Tell Huang Yu to take over the border.

883
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Yes.

884
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
We are from the Six Faction.

885
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
We have something important to talk to Minister Lu.

886
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Please...

887
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Yuan Jin Xia, from the Six Faction.

888
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Yang Yue, from the Six Faction.

889
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Greetings, Minister Lu.

890
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
We have orders.

891
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
We won't disturb you.

892
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
You have a good ear.

893
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
San Fa Si sent us

894
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
to cooperate with you.

895
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
We would like to ask you to

896
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
give us some advice.

897
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
This is the ship for you.

898
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Don't disturb him.

899
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
If that's the case,

900
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
we won't disturb him.

901
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,620
Goodbye.

902
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,620
He is not a big man.

903
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,620
He is quite arrogant.

904
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
Minister, I'm afraid

905
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,620
it's not peaceful this time.

906
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
Water does not go against the river.

907
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Let's stay away from them.

908
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
They don't have to bother us.

909
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
Let's go.

910
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Oh my god.

911
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
How can I sleep?

912
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,620
I'm so bad at

913
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,620
sleeping in this bed.

914
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,620
Master.

915
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,620
Is there something smelly

916
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
in your room?

917
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,620
It's okay.

918
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,620
I'll be here in a few days.

919
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,620
I'll be here in a few days.

920
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Dayang.

921
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
You can smell the tea.

922
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
You are so good.

923
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Stop praising me.

924
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
I know what you mean.

925
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I'll go to your room

926
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
to smell the tea.

927
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Father, you can go in and rest.

928
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
Master, you can rest.

929
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
I'll go up and get some fresh air.

930
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Do you remember

931
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
what I told you before you left?

932
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
I remember.

933
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,480
You have a good eye.

934
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,340
I'll remember it.

935
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,340
Go.

936
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,340
Okay.

937
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,340
Come, father, be careful.

938
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Dayang.

939
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
You know me?

940
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Eat.

941
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Episode 14

942
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,480
Right.

943
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Father asked me to bring you a message.

944
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,480
The deceased

945
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,480
is dead.

946
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480
It seems that the storm is coming.

947
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Master.

948
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Are you okay?

949
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm fine.

950
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
In the corner of the corner,

951
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,480
the wind blows and the ship moves.

952
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,480
The heart is blank.

953
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,480
A thousand miles of ambush comes.

954
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Who is out of the city?

955
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Can't beat the fate.

956
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Close your eyes, I can see your face.

957
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Open your eyes, the back is cold.

958
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
The sword is full of sky.

959
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:05,480
In the mortal world, who has conquered?

960
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,480
No sound, the dark cloud rises.

961
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,480
The fate turns.

962
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,480
See through the changes in the world.

963
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,480
The farewell is too sad.

964
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,480
The golden leaf of the yearning

965
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,480
meets the day you were born.

966
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,480
White hair with the same thread.

967
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,480
The same age.

968
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:51,480
In the dream, a word of farewell.

969
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,480
The End
