00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm afraid

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm afraid

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are my only one

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Jinxia

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Jinxia is the descendant of the Xia family

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then you two are not enemies

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The public Ministry is not content

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not a day or two

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But now

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's all in my head

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You send someone to check

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The real reason for the collapse of the Taoist priest

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Jinxia

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You two have come all the way

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I see it all

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is there any misunderstanding

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or you talk to him again

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Nothing to talk about

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to be alone for a while

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I feel better alone

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Ok, I put the star candy here

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You will drink it all later

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can find me if you need

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What about us

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They became like this

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Put it here

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Give this to Big Brother

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ok

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mr Xia, good news

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I just received the letter

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Xiruo and Xie Xiao are coming back in two days

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Xia Yi.

47
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
When will they come?

48
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
In a few days.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Didn't you tell me yesterday

50
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
that they would come in a few days?

51
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
What do you mean by a few days?

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
How long ago was that?

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
I might have miscalculated it.

54
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I think

55
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,400
you just didn't remember it.

56
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Can you take a break?

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm really worried about you.

58
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Worry about what?

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
What's there to worry about?

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Before,

61
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
you enjoyed your job.

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
You were happy every day.

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
But now?

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
You're so bored every day.

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
Sometimes I'm really worried

66
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
that you'll be too bored.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm not bored.

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm happy.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
I work hard and earn money.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,600
It's good.

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Are you still working?

72
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
Working?

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Are you really working?

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,200
You can't fool me.

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
I know.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
You're still thinking about Lu Yi.

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Right?

78
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,000
I know.

79
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,800
It's hard to forget someone.

80
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,200
But...

81
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,400
But...

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Isn't Xie Xiao coming?

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I remember that he

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
liked you before.

85
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,000
Look.

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
Now, Mr. Lu isn't with you.

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Is it possible that you two...

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Impossible.

89
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,800
If you say it again, I'll beat you.

90
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Okay.

91
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Okay.

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
I won't say it.

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
I won't say it.

94
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,800
Come on.

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Keep reading.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Work hard.

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Mom.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Zero.

99
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,600
Dad,

100
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,200
it's getting cold.

101
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,100
Let the servants

102
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
heat the house.

103
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
The problem is on the wood.

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I've already checked the wood.

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I found that these wood are not used for pine wood.

106
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
They are easily made into mountain wood.

107
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:10,020
And they didn't do any

108
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Yan Shao Qiong?

109
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I remember your question.

110
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,800
A few days ago, Yan Shao Qiong dismissed his servants.

111
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:33,420
He removed all the

112
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,420
I'm afraid that these money are not enough to build a garden.

113
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,420
It's not a big deal.

114
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,420
But to combine with the collapse of the Star-pillar,

115
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,420
this matter is very laughable.

116
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,420
The annual settlement is coming soon.

117
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,420
This is your punishment.

118
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Father, how do you know that I want to choose the annual settlement?

119
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,420
These are all the files of the government.

120
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,420
Take it back and read it as soon as possible.

121
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Yes.

122
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Not only read these,

123
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,420
from today on, you will write all the files of my case.

124
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
From today on?

125
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,420
I will send someone to send to your room.

126
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Father, you have served the emperor for almost forty years.

127
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
Why?

128
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Because you know him.

129
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Where does the emperor go to find people like you?

130
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,420
So, as long as the emperor is here,

131
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,420
we will not see the strict favor of the Yan family.

132
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,420
I heard that the emperor inquired about Lan Qingxuan.

133
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,420
Lan Qingxuan is recommended by Xu Jing.

134
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,420
If she is crazy in front of the emperor,

135
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,420
the Yan family will not be able to stand it.

136
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
She is a bad Taoist.

137
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,420
She is not worthy of being crazy.

138
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
But father,

139
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,420
if someone from the Ministry of Works comes to find you these days,

140
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
you will not see them.

141
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,420
I will handle the rest.

142
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,420
Sir,

143
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,420
the master asked me to bring you these files.

144
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
Put it there.

145
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,420
You should not be afraid.

146
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
I am not afraid.

147
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
I am going to take care of it.

148
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
I will go.

149
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,420
Go.

150
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Go.

151
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
Go.

152
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,420
Go.

153
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Go.

154
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
Go.

155
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Go.

156
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Go.

157
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Go.

158
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Go.

159
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
I thought

160
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
that I would be at the wrong man's side

161
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,420
if I brought people who are different from others.

162
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,580
You scared me!

163
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,520
If you end up working in someone else's company

164
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,780
but you don't give up,

165
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,480
I'll hire you as my assistant at the Grand Trial Hall.

166
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,240
This is like taking back the title of Cry pid ру Xu Feng.

167
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,620
You've overestimated me.

168
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,560
Don't you think it'siful to be in the!"

169
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,420
The completed grindstone

170
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,960
brings the congress away from this.

171
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,020
Do you really want to be at His Majesty's temple?

172
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,700
It is your turn

173
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,700
What can I do to make you forget me?

174
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,300
Even if Badu Pond suffers a terrible female illness

175
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,340
it's okay

176
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,180
I could find people with gene-anrt ohed parents

177
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,780
What if Badu Pond collapses

178
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
which leads to death for Baylu

179
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,940
There are eventually disasters

180
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,980
The real completely explains it Schnabel

181
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,780
Your majesty

182
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,580
was given by God to you

183
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,780
to help you get rid of the disaster.

184
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,580
Now Bai Lu

185
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,140
is in good hands.

186
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,500
You can have no more worries.

187
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,140
You are not only healthy,

188
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,460
but also can live a good life.

189
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,860
You mean that Bai Lu

190
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,460
is helping me with the disaster?

191
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,980
Then why didn't you mention it

192
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,620
when you were in the county?

193
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,100
Your Majesty,

194
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,660
this is a natural opportunity.

195
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,660
If the natural opportunity is leaked,

196
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,980
not only will the country be prosperous,

197
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,220
but also the country will be in trouble.

198
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,620
I care about your health.

199
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,860
I dare not to say that.

200
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,180
I heard from my master that

201
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,100
all the good things in the world

202
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,820
are born for the master.

203
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,380
Bai Lu is also like that.

204
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,460
You just said that

205
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,340
the Star-picking Temple collapsed.

206
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,140
It's not God's will,

207
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,780
but human's.

208
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,900
Your Majesty,

209
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,860
I watched the sky at night

210
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,540
and found that the position of the Star-picking Temple

211
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,980
was not moved by the Star-picking Guards.

212
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,420
The main star guard, Jing Xing,

213
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,020
still guards the Star-picking Temple.

214
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,420
Therefore, I infer that

215
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,780
the Star-picking Temple

216
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,900
is not God's will.

217
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,300
It's very likely to be human.

218
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,580
If I have anything wrong,

219
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,420
it's all because of your punishment.

220
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,980
Wait.

221
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,180
The Star-picking Temple

222
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,220
has been sent to investigate.

223
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,540
Wait until the result is found.

224
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,020
You are not healthy enough

225
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,740
about Bai Lu.

226
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,260
I punish you

227
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,780
to be released for Bai Lu

228
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,300
for seven days.

229
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,540
You can't

230
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,740
step out of the temple within seven days.

231
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,540
If people know

232
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,100
what you said is not true,

233
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,540
you will be punished for your crime.

234
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

235
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,420
Stop.

236
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,980
Aunt.

237
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,500
How dare you call me aunt?

238
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,700
What do you think of my daughter?

239
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,740
Is she a commodity?

240
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,780
You can buy her if you want.

241
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,140
You can return her if you want.

242
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,380
I don't know.

243
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,780
I just want to know

244
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
what you think of her.

245
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,980
I don't know.

246
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,100
I just want to know

247
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
what you think of her.

248
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,060
I never

249
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,500
see Jin Xia as a commodity.

250
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,740
But we are not suitable for her.

251
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,860
Not suitable?

252
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,860
You are not suitable

253
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,260
for your career, right?

254
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,140
Don't think I don't know anything.

255
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,500
Dr. Lin said

256
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,540
that in order to save your life,

257
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,260
he almost died.

258
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,100
You have written a letter.

259
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,940
You don't have to be grateful.

260
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,740
You can't be so ungrateful.

261
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,180
Aunt.

262
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,940
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,580
I have made up my mind.

264
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,540
Don't let me see you

265
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,140
in a day or two.

266
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,380
Otherwise, I will beat you

267
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,900
if I see you again.

268
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,980
Don't tell me

269
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,060
that I didn't warn you.

270
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,500
Where is Jin Xia Qiao?

271
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,540
Here.

272
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,140
Why did you come in?

273
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,540
Dr. Lin.

274
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,940
My son

275
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,740
wants to ask you to go to the old place.

276
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,820
I have nothing to do with him.

277
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,380
Then don't blame me for being rude.

278
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,380
What are you doing?

279
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,740
Help!

280
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,540
You are awake.

281
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,660
Yan Shi Fen, you...

282
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,860
You have been in the capital for so long

283
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,180
and you didn't come to me.

284
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,420
I was so anxious.

285
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,660
I couldn't help it.

286
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,940
I missed you so much.

287
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,860
So I asked Yan Feng

288
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,060
to invite you here.

289
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,420
I didn't hurt you, right?

290
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,780
Ling Er.

291
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,180
Don't touch me.

292
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,220
Okay.

293
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
I won't touch you.

294
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,580
Ling Er.

295
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,500
I like you.

296
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,020
I want you

297
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,420
to stay with me willingly.

298
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,020
Okay?

299
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,220
Don't think about it.

300
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,420
Yi Yi.

301
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,900
Yi Yi.

302
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,260
Oh no.

303
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,020
Could it be...

304
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,500
Master, what do you think?

305
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,220
If Yi Yi is really taken away by Yan Shi Fen,

306
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,340
I don't know what will happen.

307
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,380
I'll go save Ling Er.

308
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,580
I'll go too.

309
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,420
Calm down.

310
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,100
Brother Lu.

311
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:42,780
Jiang Yuan, let me go.

312
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,380
Uncle.

313
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,100
Let me go.

314
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,220
Brother Lu.

315
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,860
Don't be impulsive.

316
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,220
We haven't decided

317
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,860
if Ling Er is locked in Yan's mansion.

318
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,580
He is my only family.

319
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,820
I'll go to check it even if I have a clue.

320
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,260
Xia Er.

321
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,260
Yan's mansion is not an ordinary place.

322
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,700
It's heavily guarded and the traps are sealed.

323
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,620
We even lost our lives.

324
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,820
I'll find someone to investigate it.

325
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,100
If Ling Er is locked in Yan's mansion,

326
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,340
we'll figure it out.

327
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,300
Yes.

328
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,260
You're right.

329
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,820
We need to take this seriously.

330
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,140
We can't act rashly.

331
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,540
Yi Yi.

332
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,900
How can I save you

333
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,620
from Yan Shi Fen?

334
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,860
I wonder how they are doing now.

335
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,420
This silly girl.

336
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,860
Don't take the risk for me.

337
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,020
Yan Shi Fen knows

338
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,420
the truth about Jin's family.

339
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,980
The only way to stop it

340
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,780
is to kill Yan Shi Fen.

341
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,060
Then we can have peace.

342
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,340
Open the door.

343
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,420
Open the door.

344
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,500
Open the door.

345
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,580
Open the door.

346
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,620
Open the door.

347
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,940
Open the door.

348
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,940
Open the door.

349
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,460
Open the door.

350
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,860
Open the door.

351
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,060
It's so generous of you to come to the capital.

352
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,740
It's the royal family's territory.

353
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Of course I'm looking forward to it.

354
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,940
But I still like our Yangzhou.

355
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,500
Look at it.

356
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,460
Senior.

357
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,940
I'm going to see Jin Xia.

358
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,260
Okay.

359
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,500
After the official business.

360
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,860
Yan Shi Fen is in danger.

361
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,460
How can I investigate it?

362
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,060
Xia Yan.

363
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,420
Don't worry.

364
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,860
Yan Shi Fen has been practicing martial arts for a long time.

365
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,300
She won't hurt him.

366
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,460
Besides,

367
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,980
where is Lin Yi now?

368
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,700
What if she's not with Yan Shi Fen?

369
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,260
I think it's most likely

370
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,060
that Yan Shi Fen will take her.

371
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
Open the door.

372
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,340
Open the door.

373
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,460
Open the door.

374
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
Open the door.

375
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
Open the door.

376
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
Open the door.

377
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
This is it.

378
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,180
Who is this wine jar?

379
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,660
Why do you want to pick up the porridge?

380
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,300
Boss.

381
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,500
Why are you shouting?

382
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,020
My lord.

383
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,060
You put the wine jar in the middle of the road.

384
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
How can others pass by?

385
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,860
Don't be angry, my lord.

386
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,780
It's the New Year's Eve.

387
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,660
Yan's mansion is celebrating the new year.

388
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,540
The one who gets a reward

389
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,460
will order 60 jars of wine from the shop.

390
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,660
I'm told that

391
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,180
I must send it to the mansion tomorrow.

392
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,820
The shop is not well-kept.

393
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,220
It's not time to return it.

394
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,060
Please make it convenient for me.

395
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,900
Yan's mansion is celebrating the new year?

396
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,780
Yes.

397
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,740
When will it be held?

398
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,100
I don't know when it will be held.

399
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,580
I just want to send the wine tomorrow.

400
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,900
Tomorrow?

401
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,580
Okay, I got it.

402
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,740
I'll give you the money.

403
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,180
Please find someone to return it.

404
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,260
Thank you for your tolerance, my lord.

405
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,500
Hurry up.

406
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,620
Hurry up.

407
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,220
I'm coming.

408
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,980
Take care, my lord.

409
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,260
The opportunity is here.

410
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,700
What are you doing?

411
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,660
Don't be a fool.

412
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,940
Yan's mansion is celebrating the new year.

413
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,660
They will find a maid to help them.

414
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,060
We can get in there

415
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,300
and investigate it.

416
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,500
My lord, even if we can get in there,

417
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,420
it's not something we can investigate.

418
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,900
Yeah, it's too dangerous.

419
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,940
Forget it.

420
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,260
Let's just keep it a secret.

421
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,700
No.

422
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,540
Let's just keep it a secret.

423
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,780
Of course.

424
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,900
Let's go.

425
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,820
No, my lord.

426
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,860
If you really want to go,

427
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,980
remember to call me.

428
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,460
Don't risk it alone.

429
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,900
I will.

430
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,180
Of course I will call you.

431
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,700
I told you to keep it a secret.

432
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,260
Let's go.

433
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,140
Hurry up.

434
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,780
Be careful.

435
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,860
Don't spill the wine. Hurry up.

436
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,900
Come on.

437
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
Be careful. Be careful.

438
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,340
Hurry up.

439
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,740
Be careful.

440
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,620
Okay.

441
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Be careful. Hurry up.

442
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,300
Don't spill the wine.

443
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,820
I got it.

444
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,180
Stop.

445
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,860
Where are you going?

446
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,060
You want to spill the wine again?

447
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,700
No. No.

448
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,180
Go. Go. Go.

449
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,900
They are busy.

450
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,540
Go back and help them.

451
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,460
The banquet is about to start.

452
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,020
Okay. Okay.

453
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,740
Hurry up. Hurry up.

454
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,020
How is Mr. Huang doing?

455
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,700
He is fine.

456
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,020
He is so happy.

457
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,500
And he didn't say congratulations.

458
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,540
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

459
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,900
The imperial guard is here.

460
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
Lord Lu. Lord Lu.

461
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,460
Lord Lu. Lord Lu.

462
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,300
Mr. Lu.

463
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,900
Lord Yan.

464
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,580
Why didn't Mr. Lu come?

465
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,140
My father is not well.

466
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,060
He asked me to help him.

467
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,940
Are you okay, Mr. Lu?

468
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,340
I'm fine.

469
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,540
Thank you for your concern.

470
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,460
That's good.

471
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,980
Mr. Lu, please.

472
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,540
Hurry up.

473
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,180
My house is rather simple.

474
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,660
It's not as broad as your Wu'an Gang.

475
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,740
Don't mind me.

476
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,700
Have some tea.

477
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,420
Relax. Relax.

478
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,780
Xin'er.

479
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,180
You must be tired from the journey.

480
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,900
Sit down.

481
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,580
Sit down.

482
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,300
Sit down.

483
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:19,900
Sit down.

484
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,460
Sit down.

485
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,060
Sit down.

486
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,780
Sit down.

487
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,540
Sit down.

488
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,340
Sit down.

489
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,260
I'm not tired.

490
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,660
Xin'er, are you thirsty?

491
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,340
Here. I'll pour you some water.

492
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,540
Don't bother.

493
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,860
You must be tired.

494
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,820
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

495
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,420
Here.

496
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,980
Be careful. It's hot.

497
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,540
Be careful.

498
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,540
What are you doing?

499
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,220
The light is off, right?

500
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,340
You talk too much.

501
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,700
Yang Yue.

502
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,540
Where is Jinxia?

503
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,300
How is she and that guy Lu Yi?

504
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,740
Well...

505
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,140
She...

506
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,580
Jinxia and Lu Yi broke up.

507
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,060
Break up?

508
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,860
Did Lu Yi do anything to hurt Jinxia?

509
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,380
No.

510
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,060
No.

511
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,540
It's because of Jinxia's background.

512
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,300
What does Jinxia's background have to do with Lu Yi?

513
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,300
Jinxia...

514
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,180
She is...

515
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,980
Don't be so slow.

516
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,820
Just tell me.

517
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,740
She...

518
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,620
What happened?

519
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,780
Yang Yue.

520
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,020
Is there anything difficult to say about Jinxia's background?

521
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,220
We are not outsiders.

522
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,500
We won't tell others.

523
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,180
Yes. Tell us.

524
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,660
Jinxia is...

525
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,660
She is Xia Ran's descendant.

526
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,180
Xia Ran of the Qian Shou Mansion?

527
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,700
Doctor Lin and Jinxia are looking for their relatives.

528
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,100
But they are right beside each other.

529
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,100
What a coincidence.

530
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,700
What a lucky day.

531
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,340
Yes.

532
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,220
Lu Yi left Jinxia because he was afraid of being implicated.

533
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,660
I didn't expect he is such a person.

534
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,220
No.

535
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
I have to go to find Lu Yi.

536
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,580
I have to find an explanation for Jinxia.

537
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,260
Junior, don't be impulsive.

538
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,100
Yes.

539
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,260
Doctor Lin was caught by Yan Shi Fan.

540
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,780
Jinxia is also depressed.

541
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,580
So I think, Brother Xie,

542
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,020
you should not go to find Lu Yi.

543
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,420
Or Jinxia will be poisoned.

544
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,020
This is the capital.

545
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,500
It's Yan Shi Fan's territory.

546
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,260
It's difficult to save Doctor Lin.

547
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,100
Yes.

548
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,140
Yes.

549
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,020
And now,

550
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,820
even Uncle Gai has no way out.

551
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,180
Jinxia must be worried.

552
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,100
Will he take action rashly?

553
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,100
I can't tie him up and watch him.

554
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,780
I'm afraid of any trouble.

555
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,940
I'm worried too.

556
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,380
I'll go to see him.

557
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,340
OK.

558
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,940
What are you doing?

559
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,580
What are you doing?

560
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,060
What are you doing?

561
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,620
It hurts.

562
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,180
Officers,

563
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,100
I...

564
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,500
I followed my master to the banquet.

565
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,060
But I went to the side of the road.

566
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,500
I didn't expect Yan's mansion is so big.

567
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,060
I can't find Lu.

568
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,540
Please go to Yan's mansion.

569
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,140
OK.

570
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,700
OK.

571
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,340
OK.

572
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,980
OK.

573
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,580
OK.

574
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,100
OK.

575
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,700
OK.

576
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,300
OK.

577
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,900
OK.

578
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,580
OK.

579
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,180
OK.

580
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,900
OK.

581
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,580
OK.

582
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,260
Beside father,

583
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,980
department leaders,

584
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,620
How's Gu Wei,

585
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,140
Director Lu,

586
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,540
are you following Yan?

587
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,060
Now they are...

588
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,740
They are...

589
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,820
They are...

590
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,260
YouE.

591
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,820
I...

592
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,540
I follow Yan

593
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,500
According to Bi's order,

594
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,660
I come by women's solitude to give intelligence.

595
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,260
Director Lu?

596
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,680
Director Lu!

597
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,260
Sir Yan.

598
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
I still have things to do.

599
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,660
I already informed Chief Yan.

600
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,660
I'll take my leave.

601
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,660
I rarely see Lu Qian Shi's figure in such a place.

602
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
It's really rare to see him today.

603
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
Not only did he come to the banquet,

604
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,660
even the servant he brought with him looks very elegant.

605
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
You're a good friend.

606
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,660
Little girl, why aren't you saying hello to me?

607
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I came to the banquet for my father.

608
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,660
My father is in good health.

609
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
I still have to go back to take care of him.

610
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
I'll take my leave.

611
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
I'm leaving.

612
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Didn't I tell you not to be impulsive?

613
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,660
Yan Shi Fan recognized you just now.

614
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
So what if he recognizes me?

615
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660
I can't control so much since he caught my aunt.

616
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Doctor Lin was caught by Yan Shi Fan?

617
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,660
Why didn't you come to me?

618
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm a criminal's granddaughter.

619
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,660
I can't even deliver goods.

620
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,660
Will you still help me?

621
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Promise me.

622
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Don't make any more mistakes.

623
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Even if it's for me,

624
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
be more careful in the future.

625
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
Be more cautious.

626
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Okay?

627
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,660
I know.

628
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
You should be good.

629
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,660
You should do whatever I say in the future.

630
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
That way, I won't have any problems.

631
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,660
The only woman I want to marry in my life

632
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
is you.

633
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
Yuan Jin Xia.

634
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Remember, everything has me.

635
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Don't think about anything else.

636
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Leave everything to me.

637
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,660
Thank you for helping me out.

638
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,660
But please stay away from me.

639
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
I don't want to drag you down.

640
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,660
If you don't have any other orders,

641
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,660
I'll take my leave.

642
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,660
I'm leaving.

643
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
I'm leaving.

644
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
Mom.

645
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
Come here.

646
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Look.

647
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
I'm here to catch you.

648
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
Hurry.

649
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Hurry.

650
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Go catch her.

651
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
Come and catch me.

652
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Mom, the plate.

653
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,660

00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Come.

Come.

657
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Come.

658
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Come.

659
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Come.

660
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Come.

661
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Come.

662
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Come.

663
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Come.

664
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Come.

665
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Come.

666
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Come.

667
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660

668
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Come on, como

669
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,660
Come.

670
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660

671
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
Give me a co

Come.

673
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
What are we going to do?

674
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
Just let us to trap her.

675
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
Catch me

676
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
I'll hold on your back and

677
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,660
Let you hold it together.

678
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,660
Hurry.

679
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
I got it

680
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,020
Come on

681
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,820
I got it

682
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,300
Slow down

683
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,420
Slow down

684
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,300
I got it, I got it

685
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,540
Xia Ruizhi is so brilliant

686
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:47,860
I got it

687
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,580
Xia Ruizhi

688
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,100
I got it

689
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,180
Mom

690
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,940
You're now in Yan Shifan's hands

691
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,260
I can't do anything

692
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,340
I'm a useless person

693
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,860
I finally found my only wife

694
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,020
I really don't want to lose her

695
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,100
What should I do?

696
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,820
Mom, tell me

697
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,580
Mom

698
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,820
I can't do this anymore.

699
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,820
I can't be close to Jin Xia anymore.

700
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,820
For your own good,

701
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,820
Jin Xia,

702
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,820
I'd rather you hate me.

703
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,820
But Qing Gui,

704
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,820
I'm not afraid of you.

705
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,820
I'm not afraid of you.

706
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,820
I'm not afraid of you.

707
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,820
I'm not afraid of you.

708
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,820
I'm not afraid of you.

709
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,820
I'm not afraid of you.

710
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,820
I'm not afraid of you.

711
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,820
But please believe me,

712
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,820
I'll give you an answer.

713
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Jin Xia.

714
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
Mother.

715
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
There was a boy named Xie Xiao at the door.

716
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,820
He said he wanted to see you at Xin Feng Bridge.

717
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Xie Xiao?

718
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,820
He said he wouldn't go back today

719
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,820
if he didn't see you.

720
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Go and see him.

721
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Go.

722
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,820
Okay.

723
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Mother, you should rest.

724
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
I'll go and see him.

725
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
Here, Yuan Da Xia.

726
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
Look.

727
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
I'm so tired.

728
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
I'm so tired.

729
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,820
I'm so tired.

730
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
I'm so tired.

731
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,820
I'm so tired.

732
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,820
I'm so tired.

733
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,820
I'm so tired.

734
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,820
I'm so tired.

735
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,820
I'm so tired.

736
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,820
I'm so tired.

737
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
I'm so tired.

738
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,820
I'm so tired.

739
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,820
I'm so tired.

740
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
I'm so tired.

741
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm so tired.

742
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,820
I know.

743
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,820
I know everything.

744
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,820
Xiao Yang Yang.

745
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,820
I finally found my only family.

746
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,820
But I can't protect him.

747
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,820
Yuan Da Xia.

748
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,820
You're not like the Yuan Da Xia

749
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,820
I knew before.

750
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,820
The one who is not afraid of anything.

751
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,820
What can I do if I'm not afraid of anything?

752
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,820
I used to think

753
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,820
I have some money.

754
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,820
I'm living a small life.

755
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
I'm not afraid of anything.

756
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,820
But now, the sky is really going to fall.

757
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,820
I'm afraid of nothing.

758
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,820
I dare not go to the money.

759
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,820
I'm such a big person.

760
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,820
How can I not even protect my family?

761
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,820
I'm so useless.

762
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,820
Why are you useless?

763
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,820
The power of the Yan family is too strong.

764
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,820
Don't cry.

765
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
I don't know what to do now.

766
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
I have no way.

767
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,820
I don't want to sit and wait like this.

768
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,820
I don't want to do anything.

769
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,820
Don't you still have me?

770
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,820
What's the matter?

771
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
Let's discuss it together.

772
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,820
Let's figure it out together.

773
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,820
Although I have no power in the capital.

774
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,820
But my kung fu is not bad.

775
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,820
What's the danger in the future?

776
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,820
Let me help you do it.

777
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
Thank you, Xin Yue Yue.

778
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,820
But it's my own business.

779
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
I don't want to drag you down.

780
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,820
Unless you don't take me as your brother.

781
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Since we are the best brothers.

782
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,820
We should go together to bear.

783
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,820
Yuan Daxia.

784
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,820
For you.

785
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,820
I go up the mountain and down the sea.

786
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,820
Two kinds of knives are never enough.

787
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
Don't refuse me.

788
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,820
Okay.

789
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,820
Even if you want to refuse me.

790
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,820
I will do it.

791
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,820
Okay.

792
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
Don't cry.

793
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
Okay.

794
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,820
You are old enough to cry.

795
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,820
Today we should forget all the sorrows.

796
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,820
It will be solved.

797
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,820
Right?

798
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,820
Let's put the fireworks.

799
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,820
Okay.

800
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,820
Here.

801
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,820
Forget all the sorrows.

802
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,820
Thank you, Xin Yue Yue.

803
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,820
If you thank me again, we will be far apart.

804
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,820
Don't thank me.

805
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,820
Yuan Daxia.

806
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,820
I am here.

807
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,820
Forget all the sorrows.

808
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,820
I...

809
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,820
Yuan Daxia.

810
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,820

811
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,820
Forget all the sorrows.

I am here.

813
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,820
