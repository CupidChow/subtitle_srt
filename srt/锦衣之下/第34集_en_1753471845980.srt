YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separated by two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just got a message from Hangzhou City

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That things are done

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Only one step left

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Finally, we have a good news

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Childe

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Father

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yesterday, in order to avoid the traitors

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I hid in the room with Si Ma Chang An for a night

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Everyone in the room saw it

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't want to be a burden to others

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Please help me

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't take the rumors

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In your heart

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will find a way

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To suppress the rumors

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You get up first

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Father

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have one more request

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I have a heart

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That person is my elder brother

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I want to marry him

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Please help me

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Your cousin is really a good man

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you can marry him

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I will be happy to

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But I don't want to

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Of course

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I'm afraid I don't like you

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Because of your cousin

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It doesn't matter

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I will find a way

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
To make him like me

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As long as you like me

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is the newly made pill

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Please try it

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Since Master Yan Ming left

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The pill he made is getting worse

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And worse

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He doesn't have the feeling of being hot

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And he is filial

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's the only thing he can't be checked

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will tell you

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
To find a way

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How is it?

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Your Majesty

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Recently in the capital

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There is a Taoist

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He lives in the quiet house

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In the outskirts of the city

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I heard that he is a man of high status

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He is a man of low status

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He is a man of low status

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He is good at asking for the Tao

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I heard that he has a recipe

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I heard that he has all the words

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He has all the words

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I also heard that

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Many people want to spend a lot of money

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
To ask him to go to the mansion to ask for the Tao

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But he was rejected

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And he has the rule

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The person who wants to see him

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Must go to the inn

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
To line up to get the Tao

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How arrogant he is

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Who says he is not?

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Majesty

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How about

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I send someone

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
To marry him to you?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No need

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He has the character of a young man

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Good

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I haven't been out of the palace for a long time

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What?

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Play?

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Next

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How arrogant he is

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
My master wants to see the Taoist

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Line up

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
When can we see so many people?

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know. Please line up

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My master has a special identity

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't think we need to line up

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No matter who it is, we need to line up

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Line up

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Next

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My master, please

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Come here

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What?

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My master

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can see the Taoist's ticket

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How about it?

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do you want it?

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It needs 20 taels of silver

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Money?

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Forget it

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There are many people waiting for it

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Next

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Here

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Taoist

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Number plate

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The team, right?

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Taoist

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How do you know it?

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This number plate

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Should be released by silver

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If you wait outside with silver

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Your clothes will be wet

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But now

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Your clothes are not dirty at all

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Very dry

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Isn't it obvious

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That the tea team came in?

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We did spend 20 taels of silver

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
To come in

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But we didn't know

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What?

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We spent 20 taels of silver to come in

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If so

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please go back

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I just want to

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Make an excuse for the one who is sincere

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You really don't know what you are doing

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The people who sell the number plate at the door

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Are a team

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why are you lying to me?

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I won't give you 20 taels of silver

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You leave the prison now

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't delay others

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are so rude

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Taoist

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We did go to the prison

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But you didn't tell us

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
To get the number plate

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We don't want to waste time

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Of course

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We all come to see you

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
With our own ability

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The words of the master

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Although it's strange

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But it makes sense

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What do you want to ask?

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is the birth date of our master

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ding Mao

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ji You

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Xin Si

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Ji Hai

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Is there a problem?

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
From the master's birth date

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The life should be born in the palace

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's the will of the heaven

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
To rule the people

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And enjoy the peace

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Taoist

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You are talking nonsense

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I was born in the city

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Where did the saying of rule the people come from?

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Even in the city

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's the dragon's phoenix

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The wealth and the family

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The best of the best

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The one who doesn't care about the fortune

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Should be capable

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He can be the guide

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
To persuade others to be good

194
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And have great merits

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If you lie to others

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can be lucky

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Taoist

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How can others trust you?

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The heart is not beautiful

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The beauty is not true

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The good person is not good

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The good person is not good

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The wise person is not good

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The good person is not good

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's the way of the heaven

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
To be good

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The way of the saint

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
To be good

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Look at you

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The appearance of the family

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Can't be suspected

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Taoist

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You are a good teacher

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't be good enough

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can't be good enough

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I can't be good enough

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can't be good enough

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can't be good enough

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Taoist

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How can I

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Trust you?

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you don't believe me

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can make a bet with you

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

225
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What?

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have been watching the sky

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I found the southeast direction is dark and lightless

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is a sign of the opposite direction

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
In ten days

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There will be a riot in the southeast direction

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Although it doesn't affect the tide

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But it's also a danger

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How dare you

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You are so reckless

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Aren't you afraid of being killed?

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes, master

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't want to talk about it

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But things are out

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I can make a conclusion

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Taoist

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We are on the deadline for half a month

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What if nothing happens?

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I will leave the money

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I will leave

245
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I will never step into the capital

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Taoist

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you are telling the truth

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This jade card

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Is yours

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Your Majesty

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am Yinzhu

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I didn't know you would come

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Please forgive me

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Stand up

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I dare not

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Stand up

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You just counted the right death

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You don't have to be so polite

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you, your Majesty

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I will wait for you for half a month

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Come

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Master, madam

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Hurry up

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I am blessed by your grace

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
My sister-in-law is here today

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She is so happy

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Do you know, Mr. Sima?

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He said since the last meeting

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He saw your lady

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He has been suffering from homesickness

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He asked me to come

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Come, come, come

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Bring it in

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
These are just a meeting gift

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you agree

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My lady

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I have a lot of wedding gifts

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I won't marry

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I won't marry even if he has money

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Miss Chunyu and Mr. Sima

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Everyone knows about it

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If Mr. Sima doesn't marry Miss Chunyu

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I am afraid that in the future

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What are you talking about?

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Qi'er

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My sister wants to marry

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Are you afraid that no one wants it?

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Brother, you are back

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Go back and tell Sima Chang'an

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He borrowed money from Baishen

295
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He doesn't deserve my sister

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Master, Miss Zhai is here

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Master Dong

298
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You have done a lot

299
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
To kidnap people

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I have no other choice

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The chief's failure

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Now we need money

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The lady in Hangzhou

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is really talented

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I did this

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
For the interests of our family

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So I did this

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The second master is just right

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
When the official comes

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The ransom is just right

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Before the second master does it

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Should he tell us first?

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You are very unhappy about this

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I know

316
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You have no other choice

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You should go back and tell us

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I will go back

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And tell the official

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You should go back

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Miss Zhai

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't put the cross in front of me

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't listen to anyone

325
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Except for the chief

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hangzhou is not a small town

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If anything goes wrong

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't expect the chief to protect you

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Fatty, all the money and people are here.

330
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,600
People? Who are they?

331
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Although they are not the person you want,

332
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,400
one of them is the one I want day and night.

333
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,800
I wish I could kill him.

334
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
And you know this person very well.

335
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,200
She is your good friend.

336
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,800
Miss Dai, do you want to talk with her?

337
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Sure.

338
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,600
They have made me suffer a lot.

339
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
So I let my brothers play with me.

340
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,600
I didn't expect it to be so fast.

341
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,600
I didn't expect you to have such a difficult day.

342
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
You are here to laugh at me, right?

343
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,600
I didn't know that the owner of the Dong family

344
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,400
had an enemy.

345
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
What enemy?

346
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,400
My biggest enemy is you.

347
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
You still don't know

348
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,400
who the person who destroyed your water village is.

349
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Tell me clearly.

350
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Dong Qisheng.

351
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,200
Miss Zhai, this concerns the lives of more than 100 people in my water village.

352
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't be so weird.

353
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Speak.

354
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,800
The person who destroyed your water village is not me.

355
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,400
The real murderer is me.

356
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
What did you say?

357
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,600
The person who killed more than 100 people in the Dong family is me.

358
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
It has nothing to do with him.

359
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,200
Say it again.

360
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
What?

361
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,200
Does Second Master Dong still want to avenge them?

362
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Miss Zhai!

363
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,800
I dare to ask you.

364
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,200
Why did you do such a cruel thing to the Dong family?

365
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,400
Nothing.

366
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
You just don't like it.

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,800
Since it's you,

368
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,000
I won't investigate this matter anymore.

369
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
The one who knows the truth is the murderer.

370
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
I never thought that Second Master Dong

371
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,600
is also a person who knows the truth.

372
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,200
Since I'm loyal to you,

373
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,600
I won't make you angry because of the past.

374
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,200
I won't make you unhappy.

375
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
It's good that you think so.

378
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Since he's not your enemy,

379
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
it's useless to keep them.

380
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
It's just that,

381
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,200
you ordered me to investigate Yuan Jinxia's matter.

382
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,400
Why don't you do something to get rid of them?

383
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
No.

384
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Why not?

385
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,200
Since it's you,

386
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,800
it's not good if I don't let them go.

387
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,000
But you can only take them away.

388
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,400
I want him.

389
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
You are indeed a sister.

390
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I won't go.

391
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Take Yang Yue away.

392
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Do you know what you're saying?

393
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
If you take me away,

394
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
then take away a corpse.

395
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Okay.

396
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Be careful.

397
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
We are sisters.

398
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I can only do these.

399
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Don't blame me.

400
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Take Yang Yue away.

401
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Sir.

402
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Where is she?

403
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Sir.

404
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Sit.

405
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Sir asked me to come.

406
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
What can I do for you?

407
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
I'm hungry.

408
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I want to have a meal with you.

409
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Okay.

410
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Waiter, order.

411
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Coming.

412
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
What would you like to eat?

413
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Miss.

414
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Whatever.

415
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Miss, I don't have any.

416
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Yang Yue and Shangguan Xin may be still alive.

417
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Sir, I have news.

418
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
You should order.

419
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
I'll tell you when you eat.

420
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Okay, I'll order.

421
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Good news is good news.

422
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Do you want anything else?

423
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Anything?

424
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I haven't had a good meal these days.

425
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Waiter, bring me your best dishes.

426
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Okay, coming.

427
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Sir, what's the situation?

428
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I asked Cen Fu to check around Guanjia Restaurant.

429
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
I found some clues.

430
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,680
There are two people's footprints and a

431
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,400
trail.

432
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,400
According to the size and depth of the trail,

433
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
it's the three of them.

434
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Trail?

435
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,400
That means at least one person is injured.

436
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Yes.

437
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Sir, let's follow the trail to find it.

438
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
I've asked Xie Xiao to go.

439
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
He will take the people of Wu An Gang to investigate.

440
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
These pirates usually kill a lot.

441
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
They are all in a small town in the coastal area.

442
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
They can't handle the weather.

443
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
This time they dare to do it in Hangzhou.

444
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
They are bold enough.

445
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,400
The pirates are so long-winded.

446
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Do you think it's Yan family that supports them?

447
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Yan is a man of character.

448
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
He will not do anything without interests.

449
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Do you know?

450
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
What's wrong?

451
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
The son of Chunyu family just came back to Hangzhou.

452
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
He was killed in the floating house to fight for a prostitute.

453
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
You mean the emperor of Yang Ma?

454
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
The son of Chunyu family?

455
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
There are several Chunyu family in Hangzhou.

456
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Who killed him?

457
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
The biggest Yan family.

458
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
The head of Si Ma family.

459
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Forget it.

460
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
What do we eat today?

461
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Whatever.

462
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
You bastard.

463
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
You know you are the only son.

464
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
You should know you are proud of yourself.

465
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
You are hurting others.

466
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Dad, don't hit me.

467
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm wrong.

468
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Who did you kill?

469
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Where is Miss Tu Mi?

470
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
She is not feeling well these days.

471
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
It's not convenient for her to welcome guests.

472
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Girls, please take care of her.

473
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Yes.

474
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Young master.

475
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Please have a seat.

476
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,400
The sound is...

477
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Isn't she Miss Tu Mi?

478
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Yes.

479
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Young master Chunyu.

480
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Miss Tu Mi said it's not convenient for her to welcome guests.

481
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Who are you?

482
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
You are not happy here.

483
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Get out.

484
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
You took my woman.

485
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Why do you fight with me?

486
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
You are not a good follower.

487
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Young master Chunyu, I will fight with you.

488
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Chunyu.

489
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Chunyu.

490
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Help.

491
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Help.

492
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Help.

493
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
The head of Si Ma Chang'an family.

494
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Si Ma Chang'an.

495
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
The one who proposed marriage today.

496
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Si Ma Chang'an.

497
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Yes, it's him.

498
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,400
If we can reconcile.

499
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Yes, dad.

500
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
If we can make peace.

501
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:56,220
I will be a

502
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,400
Dad, you don't want to...

503
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Mi.

504
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
You know.

505
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Our family is like this.

506
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
A son who is a successor.

507
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Brother.

508
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
What's wrong?

509
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Mi.

510
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Get up.

511
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Brother.

512
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Get up.

513
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,400
My dad wants to marry me to Si Ma Chang'an.

514
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
That ugly man.

515
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
I can't marry him.

516
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Brother, help me.

517
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
I can't help you with this.

518
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
No.

519
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
No.

520
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
As long as you marry Mi.

521
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
And tell Si Ma Chang'an.

522
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
I am married to you.

523
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
He won't dare to fight with the Lu family.

524
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
What about your brother?

525
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Brother.

526
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
He just needs to save his life.

527
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Cut his career.

528
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
It's better than sacrificing my life.

529
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
But I don't like you.

530
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I can't give you any promise.

531
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
You don't want to marry someone you don't love.

532
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
I don't want to marry someone I don't love.

533
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Is your lover Yuan Jin Xia?

534
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,400
It's normal for men to have three wives and four concubines.

535
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Mi is willing to be a concubine.

536
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
It's not good to have too many women.

537
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,400
One wife is enough.

538
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Why are you so cruel?

539
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
I am your cousin.

540
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Why are you treating me like this?

541
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I am the Imperial Guards.

542
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Cousin should know better.

543
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Imperial Guards are ruthless.

544
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Okay.

545
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
You are ruthless.

546
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
You will regret it.

547
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Sir.

548
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Are you really going to kill Miss Chun Yi?

549
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
It's not about killing her.

550
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
It's about how to save her.

551
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Si Ma Chuan An can be a salt merchant.

552
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
He must be powerful.

553
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Although he is just a slave.

554
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
He is a killer.

555
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,400
If he insists on saving her.

556
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I am afraid.

557
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,400
He is not the only disciple of Chun Yi.

558
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Let me ask you.

559
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
If Chun Yi is not the Emperor.

560
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
What will happen?

561
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
If he is not the Emperor.

562
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
I am afraid that the horse farm will not last.

563
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Chun Yi can become the Emperor.

564
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Because of the relationship with the Lu family.

565
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Because the Lu family can protect them for the rest of their lives.

566
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Chun Yi is young.

567
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
But she is abandoned by the King.

568
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
If she really wants to be a slave.

569
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I am afraid that the Emperor will not last for many years.

570
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Chun Yi is not the only one who can depend on the Lu family.

571
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
There will not be any good result.

572
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
I will ask Ceng Fu to go to the government office.

573
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
To see if there is any chance of this change.

574
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
You want to die.

575
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
You should have said earlier.

576
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
You don't have to save yourself.

577
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Why are you here?

578
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Where is this?

579
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Where is Shang Guan?

580
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
She is still in Dong Qi Sheng.

581
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
What?

582
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
I'm going to save her.

583
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm not going to go to Dong Qi Sheng.

584
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
I will kill her.

585
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm not going to kill her.

586
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Don't report to the government.

587
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
I... I want to save him.

588
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
You're dead now.

589
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,760
You'll die if you go.

590
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,640
I don't care.

591
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,880
If anything happens to him,

592
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,600
I want you to die with me.

593
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,400
You're a big talker.

594
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,640
You have the ability.

595
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,240
Trust me.

596
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,000
He won't die so easily.

597
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,280
If you go back like this,

598
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,520
you've let him down.

599
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
What... What do you mean?

600
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,400
Dong Qisheng sold me out.

601
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,200
He asked me to choose one of you

602
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,240
to take away.

603
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,880
I wanted to save him.

604
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
But he gave you

605
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
the only chance.

606
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,000
Dong Qisheng is so despicable.

607
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
Miss Shangguan will be

608
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,240
tortured to death by him.

609
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,680
I can't let him face it alone.

610
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,000
Even if he dies,

611
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,480
I want to die with him.

612
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,200
Yuan Yang.

613
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,480
Master.

614
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,840
Go tell Min'er

615
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,120
that the wedding date is three days later.

616
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,680
The marriage must be fixed.

617
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,960
Father really said that?

618
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,840
Miss.

619
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,840
How about we go and save Madam?

620
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,280
Madam loves Miss so much.

621
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,480
She must be so heartless

622
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,720
to see you jump into the fire.

623
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,560
Mother loves me.

624
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,440
But she loves brother more.

625
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,600
I want to run away from the wedding.

626
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,480
You Jin Yiwei and Chu Ma

627
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,760
don't have any chance to turn back.

628
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,160
Jin Yiwei is not a man of all abilities.

629
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,520
Si Ma Chang'an said that

630
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,120
he was killed by Childe Chunyu.

631
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,600
There are both human and physical evidence.

632
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,520
The case of Guanyang

633
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,000
has been handed over to the Dali Temple.

634
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,360
I'm afraid that

635
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,520
it's hard to see it clearly.

636
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,800
How's the investigation going on

637
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,680
at the Dali Temple?

638
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,440
Master.

639
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,600
The girl who was fighting with someone

640
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,760
at the Chunyu Pavilion

641
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
has been killed.

642
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,120
She left the Dali Temple.

643
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
Who killed her?

644
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,840
All the people in the Dali Temple

645
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,760
are very suspicious.

646
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
They won't tell us anything.

647
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,560
It seems that Childe Chunyu

648
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,240
was shot.

649
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
He was stabbed to death.

650
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm afraid that Chunyu Pavilion

651
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,560
still doesn't know

652
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,320
how he turned into a murderer.

653
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,560
Master.

654
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,440
In three days,

655
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,600
Miss Min will be married.

656
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,120
So soon?

657
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
The hands and back of the hand are all meat.

658
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,320
Is Lord Chunyu

659
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,480
really sacrificing his daughter

660
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,720
to save his son?

661
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,320
You drown your eyes in water.

662
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,880
IPE weather

663
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,440
Add a white ash

664
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,720
inside the pudrimum threshold.

665
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,520
Want to touch it?

666
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,120
All right, you two.

667
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,840
Today, I will definitely come back.

668
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,120
Okay.

669
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
There's so much. Let's go.

670
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,960
Little beauty, hang in there.

671
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,360
Come on.

672
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,600
How are you? Hang in there.

673
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,680
Why is it the cliff again?

674
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,040
It's okay. I'll fight them.

675
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,280
Come on.

676
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,760
You've lost your way.

677
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,320
You're still trying to make up with me.

678
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
You're not going to die first?

679
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,840
Dong Qisheng, you've already known

680
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,960
that the water village of the Dong family was destroyed.

681
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,520
It has nothing to do with the Wuwan Gang.

682
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Shangguan is not your enemy either.

683
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,880
Why do you insist on biting him to death?

684
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,360
Why do I insist on biting him to death?

685
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,400
You don't know yet?

686
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,680
You're always trying to ruin my plan.

687
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,080
How dare you try to stop me?

688
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,880
You...

689
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,400
I never thought that you'd surrender to the Japanese pirates.

690
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,840
You only care about the evil.

691
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,880
It's really hard to change the country.

692
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,840
I still remember that time when Uncle Yang was happy,

693
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,320
he played chess with me.

694
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,480
He learned to climb up to beg me.

695
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
It's really impressive.

696
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,840
Yang Yue! Yang Yue!

697
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,800
It's you!

698
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,880
Yang Yue!

699
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,760
Yang Yue!

700
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,560
Yang Yue!

701
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,160
I...

702
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,120
I can't repeat the past mistakes I made.

703
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
I'm a die-hard informations enforcement officer

704
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,040
with a high golden person in.

705
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,420
I've been bad- Student Council 1970.

706
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,240
Do you know that people who at alchemy

707
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm thinking if I should let him go.

708
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Miss Shuiguang, ignore him.

709
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
I'm dead.

710
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
I'm not afraid of Yang Yue.

711
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
You're a smart person.

712
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
He said he's not afraid.

713
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
Enough!

714
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Enough!

715
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
I'm begging you.

716
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Let him go.

717
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
You're kneeling down to beg me.

718
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Okay.

719
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Miss Shuiguang.

720
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Yang Yue!

721
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Yang Yue!

722
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Yang Yue!

723
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Yang Yue!

724
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Now, the second master is dead.

725
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
What should we do?

726
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Kill him.

727
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Revenge for the second master.

728
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Okay.

729
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
I'm sorry.

730
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
I'm late.

731
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Where are you going?

732
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm going to find him.

733
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
I want to see him.

734
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
There's something wrong with him.

735
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Yang Yue!

736
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Yang Yue!

737
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Yang Yue!

738
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Yang Yue!

739
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Yang Yue!

740
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
This is the Japanese pirates.

741
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
They're dead.

742
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
They fell from such a high place.

743
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
They're unlikely to survive.

744
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
He's dead.

745
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
It doesn't mean Yang Yue is dead.

746
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Since he's here,

747
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Yang Yue must be nearby.

748
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Yang Yue!

749
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Yang Yue!

750
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Yang Yue!

751
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
Yang Yue, where are you?

752
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Yang Yue.

753
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Yang Yue!

754
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Yang Yue!

755
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Stop looking for him.

756
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
You can't stand it.

757
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Leave me alone.

758
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
I told you to stop looking for him.

759
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
Did you hear me?

760
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
He's not alive.

761
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
He's dead.

762
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
I said he's not dead.

763
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Didn't you see the body of the Japanese pirates?

764
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Maybe his body

765
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
has been taken away by some beast.

766
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Do you want to die with him?

767
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
No.

768
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Leave me alone.

769
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
I know

770
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
you hate me.

771
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
If I hadn't killed Dong Jiashui,

772
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
Dong Qisheng wouldn't hate you.

773
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
If I hadn't done that,

774
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Yang Yue wouldn't have been found here.

775
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
He wouldn't have died

776
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
to save you and Dong Qisheng.

777
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Enough.

778
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I don't want to hear it.

779
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Yang Yue!

780
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Yang Yue!

781
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Where are you going, Xiao Xiao?

782
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Let me go.

783
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Let me go.

784
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
What are you doing?

785
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Let me go.

786
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
What happened?

787
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
I caught a thief.

788
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
I told you to let me go.

789
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Miss Min?

790
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
What are you doing?

791
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
The day after tomorrow is your wedding day.

792
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
You want to take your brother

793
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
into your arms.

794
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
You want to take your brother into your arms.

795
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
You want to take your brother into your arms.

796
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
You only care about your brother.

797
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
You pushed me into the fire pit.

798
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
I did this

799
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
because of you.

800
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
You...

801
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Father.

802
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
We just got married.

803
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
If you don't want to see me

804
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
go to Sima Mansion

805
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
with a grumpy face

806
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
on the day after tomorrow,

807
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
I suggest you

808
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
not to get married.

809
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Yuan Yang.

810
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Take Miss Min back to her room.

811
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Yes.

812
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Keep an eye on her at the door.

813
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Stay in the room before the wedding.

814
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Don't go anywhere.

815
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
I don't know it's you.

816
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
Yuan Jin Xia, I hate you!

817
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
What are you looking at?

818
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Pack your things.

819
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
Yes.

820
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Go.

821
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Sir.

822
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Did you get any news

823
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
about Dayang and Shangguan?

824
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Not yet.

825
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
I have a bad feeling recently.

826
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Except for Dayang,

827
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
there's also Chun Yu Min.

828
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
Do you think

829
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
I'm trying to harm her?

830
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Stop thinking about it.

831
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
The fate of people is complicated.

832
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
I don't know if

833
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
we're meant to be.

834
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
Dayang.

835
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Dayang.

836
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Dayang.

837
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Dayang.

838
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Where are you?

839
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Big brother.

840
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Big brother.

841
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,240
I'm asking you, are you still not willing to marry me?

842
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,440
I knew that you would be cold-hearted and not leave me alone.

843
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,840
I have a way that can save you and your brother.

844
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,040
Really?

845
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,440
But you still have to get married.

846
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,440
I'm not going to marry you.

847
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,840
You can marry me on the day of the wedding.

848
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,240
After you enter Sima's mansion, take this medicine.

849
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,240
In half an hour, you will die.

850
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,240
Don't worry. These are all fake.

851
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,040
It will only make you look like a fake.

852
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
I need a way to get rid of Sima Chang'an.

853
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,240
You can marry him.

854
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
You can die in Sima's mansion.

855
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,040
No matter how you die, it will not be related to Sima Chang'an.

856
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,440
In the end, he can only let Chun Yu go.

857
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,640
Then according to my brother's opinion,

858
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,840
I...

859
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,040
I won't be able to make Chun Yu die in this lifetime.

860
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,040
This is the only way you have now.

861
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,640
By then, I will give you a new identity.

862
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,040
Of course, I won't humiliate you.

863
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,240
If you don't do as I say,

864
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,440
even if you succeed in getting married,

865
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,240
Chun Yu's future will be ruined.

866
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,240
The royal business of Chun Yu's family will not last long.

867
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,640
From what I know about my uncle,

868
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
he won't let you go so easily.

869
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
By then,

870
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,840
you really won't have any other way out.

871
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,240
Think about it.

872
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,800
If you can make Chun Yu die in Sima Vadai's mansion,

873
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,040
your future will be much better.

874
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,440
Really.

875
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,640
I'll punish you on the moon I set for you two.

876
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,440
I'm begging you.

877
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,040
Yeah, you illiterate!

878
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,560
Uncle is a man of good looks,

879
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,560
with white hair and beautiful face.

880
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,160
My second uncle is a man of good looks,

881
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,120
with a long-lasting love.

882
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,240
My third uncle is a man of good looks,

883
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,320
with a beautiful face.

884
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,080
My fourth uncle is a man of good looks,

885
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,360
with a long-lasting love.

886
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,640
Min,

887
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,720
today is the day you get married.

888
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,840
I hope I can send you out of the house happily.

889
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,360
Don't blame me.

890
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,320
Mom,

891
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,600
I don't blame you.

892
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,360
I know you and dad are for your brother.

893
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,680
Don't worry.

894
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,160
After I get married,

895
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,320
my brother will come back.

896
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,440
I hope you can understand.

897
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,720
The so-called guest wife

898
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
is just a rumor in the room.

899
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,920
Although Sima Chang'an is ugly,

900
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,320
he is a noble man.

901
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,840
You won't be wronged

902
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,720
after you get married.

903
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,400
It doesn't matter.

904
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,720
Whether he is ugly,

905
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,880
or a king,

906
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,720
a king or a woman,

907
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,280
I don't care.

908
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,240
I don't care.

909
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,560
But

910
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,680
if I get married,

911
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,280
I will be like water.

912
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,400
In the future,

913
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,240
I can't be with you.

914
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,720
Good boy.

915
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,200
You and your brother are fine.

916
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,640
I don't care

917
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,760
about you and your dad.

918
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,880
Okay, mom.

919
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,680
Go back to your work.

920
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,720
Just leave me alone here.

921
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,600
What's the matter?

922
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,640
Just call me.

923
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,480
Have you prepared

924
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,960
everything I asked you to?

925
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm sorry.

926
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I'm sorry.

927
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
I'm sorry.

928
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,720
I'm sorry.

929
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
I'm sorry.

930
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
I'm sorry.

931
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
I'm sorry.

932
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
I'm sorry.

933
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
I'm sorry.

934
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
I'm sorry.

935
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
I'm sorry.

936
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
I'm sorry.

937
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
I'm sorry.

938
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
I'm sorry.

939
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,720
I'm sorry.

942
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
I'm sorry.

943
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,720
I'm sorry.

944
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
I'm sorry.

945
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
I'm sorry.

946
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
I'm sorry.

947
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
I'm sorry.

948
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm sorry.

949
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
I'm sorry.

950
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
I'm sorry.

951
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
