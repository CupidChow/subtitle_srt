00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000

Ah

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you think Yan Shifan

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is only targeting you?

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He wants our whole family

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you think Yan Shifan

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Is only targeting you?

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He wants our whole family

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He wants our whole family

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He wants our whole family

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He wants our whole family

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's the matter?

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You don't even deserve to be my shoes

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't deserve to be your shoes

66
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I want to deal with Lu Ting

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Lu Yi

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Lu Ting is an old fox

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm afraid she won't

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hand over her son

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She's a snake, she's seven inches

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Lu Yi is different from her father

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She's different from her father

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She's a little bit of a trick

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But she's also a person of a good temper

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If she knew that Yu Dayong

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Was taken into the prison

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She wouldn't give up easily

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We'll wait for her to commit suicide

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Then we'll use the collusion

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
With the border guards to negotiate

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We'll pull them together

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But even if

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
His Majesty thinks Lu Yi colluded with the border guards

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
With the relationship between Lu family and His Majesty

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not just His Majesty's words

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Although the world belongs to His Majesty

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
His Majesty listens to the Yan family

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If he dares to oppose the Yan family

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll make him the second servant

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes, for so many years

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He didn't end well with the Yan family

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Although His Majesty is in charge of the court

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
His Majesty is still a good man

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're right

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sir, sir

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You fell asleep like this last night

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What's wrong?

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The commander went to the prison early in the morning

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I heard that Yu Dayong was taken back to the capital

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's go and have a look

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Sir, sir

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Open the door

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
General

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mr. Lu

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Last time we met

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We were still in the battlefield

109
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I didn't expect

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I've become a prisoner now

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How could it be?

113
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
General Yu is loyal to the country

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's not guilty

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I know it

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mr. Lu

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Although I'm not a good official

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I can still kill enemies in the battlefield

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I've been through a lot of death

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But I was impeached

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I was caught by the enemy

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was killed by the enemy

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Is it reasonable?

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
General, don't lose your mind

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm loyal to the country

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm loyal to the military

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I should die in the battlefield

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is the value of my life

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is also my belief

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a pity that

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There are so many officials

132
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
who have the same belief as you

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
General, don't worry

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I won't do anything about your business

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll try my best to give you a chance

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to prove your innocence

137
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you, Mr. Lu

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Father

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're going to

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
take such a thing to the emperor

141
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You think the emperor

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
will forgive him

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
just because of these words?

144
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're really

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
crazy about love

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You've been in the Beizhen Department for so many years

147
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's the truth

148
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yu Dayong never

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
let the enemy take the lead

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Nonsense, you're like the emperor

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can't find evidence

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It only shows that

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
we are incompetent

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The emperor is suspicious

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
How do you know

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the emperor will

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
punish you if you give him the memorial

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If so

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You didn't help him

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You've hurt him

161
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sir

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're here for

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
General Yu

164
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I thought you were in a bad mood

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So I came to see you

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Is there any solution

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
for General Yu?

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Everyone puts the blame

169
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
on General Yu

170
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's a crime

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to let the enemy take the lead

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's really hard

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to get rid of him

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What should we do?

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Should we ask the emperor

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
for mercy?

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's impossible

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wanted to

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
remember the power of Weibo

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But my tracking skills

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
are not good enough

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
for the court

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But if there's anything

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I can help

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Please tell me

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You and General Yu

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
met only once in Hangzhou

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're trying to save him now

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If General Yu knows

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He will be very happy

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If the dead general like him

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
died in Zhao Yu

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's not only a pity

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But also a great honor

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not easy to train

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
such a good general

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
who knows military history

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You're so sad

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
How about I go with you?

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Maybe you can find a way

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
to get rid of him

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry

205
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I didn't mean to

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
hurt you

207
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you sure

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you won't hit me

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
if I crash into Xiao Du?

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Pass

215
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll look for a way

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Guards

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,900
The

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
good people

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
will die

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
if we miss them

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Gangster

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
How about this?

223
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
A gentleman should be a man.

224
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,240
When a child grows up,

225
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,040
he should be a man

226
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,160
who is upright and upright.

227
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,320
Good.

228
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,960
Then what is a man?

229
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,760
A filial son, loyal son, loyal son,

230
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,240
righteous son, righteous son, and honest son.

231
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,360
Yes.

232
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,400
Can you write?

233
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,920
I haven't taught you yet.

234
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,000
Good. I'll teach you.

235
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,600
Come on.

236
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,200
Come on.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,640
Father.

238
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,320
Father.

239
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Recently, someone will report

240
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,360
the murder of the Japanese pirates in Fujian.

241
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,320
You immediately ask Lai Yong to write

242
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,720
a report to calm the Japanese pirates.

243
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,680
Ask him to make a contribution to the crime.

244
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,360
The emperor will take care of it.

245
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,360
Yes.

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,740
Yes, father.

247
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You asked me out so late.

248
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Your face is so haggard.

249
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Have you been sleeping well recently?

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's nothing.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll get you some pills to help you get rid of your anger.

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll help you sleep until dawn.

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No need.

254
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
About Yu Dayong, right?

255
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I heard that he's already in the prison.

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You think I shouldn't save him?

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're right about your feelings.

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But sometimes, this friendship could hurt you.

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You and I both know that this is a strict game.

260
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
As long as you don't get into the game, you won't get into trouble.

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You have to understand that since we chose to walk this path of unsatisfied economy,

262
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
we can't just leave it like that.

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I understand.

264
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Look at this.

265
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I understand. You understand everything.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Letting Yu Dayong make a mistake and make a contribution.

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's a good way.

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But you know that the decision of His Majesty is not up to you.

269
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So I need you to do me a favor.

270
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You need me to do you a favor?

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You need me to help you get rid of your desire?

272
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're smart.

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Fine.

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Tomorrow is the double-day.

275
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
His Majesty will ask me to help him with his luck.

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Find a chance to get the memorial tablet.

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Nothing else, right?

278
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Still sleeping?

279
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's go back to sleep.

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Your Majesty, please look.

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
These three armors, one side facing the other,

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:08,800
are the

283
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,000
The signboard indicates the direction of the needle, and the direction is also east-south.

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It seems that the big brother's matter is likely to come from the southeast sea.

285
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're right.

286
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:33,160
What makes me feel most painful is the south's

287
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,000
The more the pirates, the more the more.

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
These border guards,

289
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
they received the imperial edict from me to urge the war.

290
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not that the sea is difficult to travel,

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
but the military power is insufficient.

292
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The more the more, the more the pirates will attack Liang Guang.

293
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's it.

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Your Majesty, please be at ease.

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Although the direction of the south-east is now being controlled by the weapons,

296
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
it's not that it can't be resolved.

297
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Your Majesty, please be responsible for the future.

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
When the time comes, the clouds will naturally open and the fog will disappear.

299
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Your Majesty.

300
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Imperial Guard Lu Qian wants to see you.

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Let him in.

302
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes.

303
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Summon Imperial Guard Lu Qian in.

304
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

305
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Get up.

306
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm incompetent.

308
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I used all the methods to make Yu Dayong confess his crime and come to confess.

309
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You're a tough guy.

310
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The border guards are not like the ministers.

311
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They all have their heads on the waist belt.

312
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Continue to interrogate until he confesses.

313
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Although Yu Dayong didn't confess,

314
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
he wrote a memorial and ordered me to present it to Your Majesty.

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Actually that mail must author a lot of people.

316
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You will be able to control a certain amount.

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That 아llthen I have prepared even more than enough belongs to him.

318
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Find time for mahjong.

319
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I have some time.

320
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He's quite generous.

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He's present in the forest area and still intends to seal off the army.

322
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,020
Um

323
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Does this Närokai have any solution?

324
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,340
Please have a look.

325
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,140
There's no way to solve it

326
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,100
According to this plan

327
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,700
The cavalries still have a chance to relieve lately

328
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,220
thedoesn't damage the haha

329
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,220
There will be a guy

330
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,940
to help His Majesty to get rid of this disaster.

331
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,340
Just now, Minister Lu

332
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,140
just introduced someone to His Majesty.

333
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,500
I think it's not something that can't be missed.

334
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,900
Senior Brother.

335
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,980
Lord Lu.

336
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,700
Officer Yang.

337
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,140
Junior Brother.

338
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,220
This time, I've caused you trouble.

339
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,380
Senior Brother, you've been out of the city.

340
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,620
I'm grateful for your kindness.

341
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,140
General, thanks to His Majesty's kindness this time,

342
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,380
I hope that you can leave the palace soon and get back to your post.

343
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,420
Senior Brother, I don't know when I can see you again after this farewell.

344
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,100
Don't worry. There will be a chance.

345
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,660
I'm still waiting to drink your son's wedding wine.

346
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,540
Okay.

347
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,980
By then, we will definitely have a good time.

348
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,140
You two, I'll take my leave.

349
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,500
General, take care.

350
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,340
Take care.

351
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,700
Senior Brother, take care.

352
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,980
You just want to marry him?

353
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,860
Then it depends on who you want to marry.

354
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,860
Who do you want to marry?

355
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,460
I know.

356
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,940
What?

357
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,260
Officer Yang, I've agreed to do some things for Jinxia.

358
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,300
I have to do it now. I'll take my leave now.

359
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,380
Okay.

360
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Take care, Lord Lu.

361
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,620
I really didn't expect that Lu Yi would get Yu Dayong out of the prison so quickly.

362
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,060
This matter, from the surface,

363
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,620
is that the smelly Taoist priest's false reputation.

364
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,140
His Majesty has moved his heart to forgive Yu Dayong.

365
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,260
In fact, it was Lu Ting who instigated His Majesty.

366
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,980
Senior Brother, Lu Ting has never helped people to plead for mercy.

367
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,380
But he never helped people to plead for mercy.

368
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,780
This time, it was to protect his son.

369
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,660
This father-son relationship is really hard to guess.

370
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,740
Auntie, I'm Lu Yi.

371
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,340
Dr. Lin.

372
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,300
Jinxia.

373
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,380
What are you doing?

374
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,420
You're marrying the third son of your country.

375
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,340
Why are you trying to fool me?

376
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,460
You're trying your best to get him married.

377
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,980
What do you mean by trying to fool me?

378
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,860
Did he force you to marry him?

379
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,260
Mother, I'm not fooling you. He...

380
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,060
Auntie, I'm really here to propose a marriage proposal.

381
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,260
This is a meeting gift.

382
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,940
When the marriage proposal is official, I'll give you everything according to the wedding gift.

383
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,540
I think you...

384
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,100
If you're not a father-son, then you're a son of a official.

385
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,380
How can you look up to him?

386
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,620
He's been used to it since he was little.

387
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,140
Whether he's doing it or not, whether he's standing or not,

388
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,860
don't mention his eating habits. He's even more unprofessional.

389
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,220
Where do you think you're looking up to him?

390
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,060
Mother, is there such a difference?

391
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,780
Why can't you look up to me?

392
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,980
Did I ask you?

393
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,380
Sister Yuan, what happened between them is true.

394
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,580
What happened between them is true?

395
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,460
Then...

396
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,380
What does your family do?

397
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,420
I work in the court with my father.

398
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,980
Oh, what do you do?

399
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,340
What do you do?

400
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,940
I'm a private servant of the Imperial Guards.

401
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,220
Imperial Guards...

402
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
Imperial Guards?

403
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,140
Sister Yuan, Lord Lu is handsome and well-mannered.

404
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,140
He's also good at wearing a wedding dress. He's a good man.

405
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,580
Good, good. He's good.

406
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,580
But my daughter can't do it.

407
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,700
She's been out since she was little. She's a middle-class woman.

408
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,620
Now that I think about it, what's wrong?

409
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,420
Now that I think about it, my head hurts.

410
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,020
I found this third-in-law for her.

411
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,420
But the real family of a scholar,

412
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,340
she thinks she's a bit too much.

413
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
If she gets married in the future,

414
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,940
you'll be in trouble.

415
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,540
Can you do it?

416
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,020
There are more rules in your family as officials.

417
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,540
If she wants to go, will she suffer?

418
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,100
Aunt, although I was born in a family of officials,

419
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,140
my mother passed away. My father is the only family member.

420
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,740
We don't have many commoners.

421
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,820
Don't worry.

422
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,620
Qingxia is with me. I won't let her suffer.

423
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,420
I don't know who will suffer.

424
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,420
It's done. It's done. It's good.

425
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
Then...

426
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,420
This marriage is settled.

427
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,620
When the official thing is about the marriage,

428
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,820
you can work hard.

429
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,940
Thank you, aunt.

430
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,140
Mother, are you marrying a daughter or a monster?

431
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,540
I'm a double-edged sword.

432
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,940
My mother didn't say she wanted to test you, but she agreed.

433
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,940
I think I'm really cheap.

434
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,540
If you're really cheap,

435
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
your mother would have married you.

436
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,940
I can do it.

437
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,140
Sir, look.

438
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,940
Let's go.

439
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,540
Sir, look.

440
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
There's a fish in the north. Its name is Kun.

441
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Kun is big. It's thousands of miles away.

442
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,740
It's a bird. Its name is Peng.

443
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
A fish?

444
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,940
It's not an ordinary fish.

445
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,140
It's a flying fish. It's called Kun.

446
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,340
Kun?

447
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,740
Why do you think of this?

448
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,140
I think we've been in Yangzhou since we were young.

449
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,740
We've been in the sky and the earth.

450
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,340
If it's possible, I want to be a flying fish.

451
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,140
Big.

452
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,540
Brother Lu, you try it too.

453
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,540
Brother, what should we do with this?

454
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,940
Miss, one tael of silver.

455
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,740
Here.

456
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,140
Okay.

457
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,340
Sir, this is for you.

458
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,740
You're this fish that can fly in the sky and the earth.

459
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,340
What are you laughing at?

460
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
I picked up a treasure.

461
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,740
Right?

462
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,340
Let's go take a look.

463
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,740
He said he lost his child and his family got separated.

464
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,860
I lived in the hall for a while.

465
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,700
So I adopted him to my mother.

466
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,660
Yang Li?

467
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,980
Senior brother.

468
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,740
He was only four years old when he was lost.

469
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,300
Now he is seventeen.

470
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,100
The people in the village found that

471
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,140
after the prisoner died,

472
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,580
the child was sent to the hall.

473
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,500
I wish Chen Shi, I wish Jin Xia,

474
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,620
Yang Li, Yang Cheng Wan, Lin He, and Xia Ran

475
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,780
could be taken away by others.

476
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,340
The city was lost.

477
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,700
Then I entrusted the child to Yang Cheng Wan.

478
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,260
It seems that the Xia family

479
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,540
tried their best to save the child.

480
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,220
No wonder Yang Cheng Wan's feelings for Jin Xia

481
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,980
are so different.

482
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
Sister Yuan, let me help you.

483
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,700
Don't touch me.

484
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,180
Don't touch me. I can do it myself.

485
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,020
I'm not a girl who doesn't touch Yang Chun Shui.

486
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,100
You've been busy for so long. Take a rest.

487
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
I can't tell.

488
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,420
You can do such a hard work.

489
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,060
Sister Yuan.

490
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
I heard that when Jin Xia was a child,

491
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,820
you brought him back from the hall.

492
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,300
You know it too?

493
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,740
Fine.

494
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,140
It's not a secret.

495
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,700
Yes.

496
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,180
Jin Xia told me that

497
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,540
why you brought a child back from the hall.

498
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,900
Well,

499
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,860
my husband died early.

500
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,700
I just want to bring back a child.

501
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,180
I...

502
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,860
I want to have someone to accompany me.

503
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,460
When I get old,

504
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,220
I'll have someone to talk to.

505
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,820
I have a longing.

506
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,660
I remember that time when I went to the hall,

507
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,660
there were so many children crying and making trouble.

508
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,660
Jin Xia

509
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,380
had a bowl of rice in the pot.

510
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,060
He was so small.

511
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,700
I looked at him at once.

512
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,980
You're so good at acting.

513
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,940
I remember that day when I brought him back.

514
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,500
I said we should give him a name.

515
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,900
What name?

516
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,020
There's a word on his clothes.

517
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,940
Fine.

518
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,220
Then it's Jin Xia.

519
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,020
It's so popular that people laugh at it.

520
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,140
Sister Yuan,

521
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,100
do you still keep that dress?

522
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,020
Yes.

523
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,420
I want to have a look.

524
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,580
Please help me take it out.

525
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,940
I'll keep it.

526
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,420
I said I'll make clothes for Jin Xia's children.

527
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,620
They're all here.

528
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,660
Xia.

529
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,700
Xia is here.

530
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,460
Jin Xia is here.

531
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Consider it done.

532
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,660
Yes, sister.

533
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,460
Thank you.

534
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,100
Jin Xia,

535
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,380
this Sisters Flower

536
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,180
I finally found it.

537
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,820
Sister.

538
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,780
Sister's child.

539
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,380
Sister.

540
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,860
Mother.

541
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,580
Isn't this my childhood dress?

542
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,900
Why did you flip it?

543
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,060
Sister.

544
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,140
You are my sister's daughter.

545
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
I found you.

546
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,300
I finally found you.

547
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,940
I finally found you.

548
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,180
Look at your beautiful eyes.

549
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,420
You are exactly like my sister.

550
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,980
Sister, look.

551
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,300
This is made by your mother.

552
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,740
This...

553
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,900
This is not accurate.

554
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,500
There are so many clothes like this.

555
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,440
There should be Jin Xia's birthday

556
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,940
and eight characters in it.

557
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,380
Sister.

558
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,540
Your handwork is really good.

559
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,500
What is this?

560
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,940
This is the child's birthday.

561
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,340
Why did you sew this cloth

562
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,500
into the child's clothes?

563
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,260
This is the old man's custom.

564
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,500
The child's birthday is in the clothes.

565
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,020
It can be used to report the disaster.

566
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,540
There is such a saying?

567
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,380
By the way,

568
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,340
you are going back to the Apothecary Valley tomorrow, right?

569
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,180
I am going back tomorrow.

570
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,180
I don't know when I will see you again.

571
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,780
Be careful on the way.

572
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,140
Take care of yourself.

573
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,220
I know.

574
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,260
I will.

575
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,180
Alright.

576
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,500
Look.

577
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,060
Not less accurate.

578
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,340
That's not certain.

579
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,300
Jinxia was very good when she was a child.

580
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Maybe she learned it from someone else.

581
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,820
She can sing the same song that my sister wrote.

582
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,980
Right, Jinxia?

583
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,980
She was smart when she was a child.

584
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,340
She learned things so fast.

585
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,100
Sister Yuan, I won't be wrong.

586
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,020
Jinxia is really my sister's child.

587
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,060
Or why would Brother Yang

588
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,500
take her as his disciple

589
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,900
and train her?

590
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,860
Because she is born with intelligence.

591
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,860
Sister Yuan, believe me.

592
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,020
Jinxia is really my sister's daughter.

593
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,460
I'm very grateful that you've raised Jinxia for more than ten years.

594
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,980
You even took good care of her.

595
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,820
I'm grateful to you on behalf of my sister.

596
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Ning Jinxia.

597
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,940
You are my aunt.

598
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Aunt.

599
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
Aunt.

600
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,220
I've been calling you aunt for a year. It's true.

601
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,820
What about my parents?

602
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,420
Jinxia, your parents...

603
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,940
Your parents are no longer here.

604
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
Jinxia.

605
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,740
Your surname is Xia.

606
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,060
You are Xia Ran's granddaughter.

607
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
That year,

608
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,860
I received a letter from my sister

609
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,420
asking me to go to the capital

610
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,660
to find Brother Yang to take you away.

611
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,060
After reading the letter,

612
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,980
Senior Brother and I rushed to Xia's house.

613
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,780
I can't forget what I've seen in my life.

614
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,260
It's the pain I can't forget in my life.

615
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,020
Ling'er.

616
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,500
Where is my sister?

617
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,260
Where is my sister?

618
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,660
Ling'er.

619
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,540
Where is my sister?

620
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,020
Where is my sister?

621
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,820
Where is my sister?

622
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,540
Ling'er.

623
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,860
Where is Sis?

624
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,540
Guard him.

625
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,740
What happened?

626
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:51,700
There left a mark of human s-

627
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,700
Don't be angry!

628
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:06,940
Let's Queen Kong

629
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,060
is a big fish for you.

630
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,780
What happened? Help me save him.

631
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,140
Sister.

632
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,140
Sister.

633
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,100
Why did you leave me?

634
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,700
What should I do?

635
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,900
What should I do?

636
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,540
Give it to me.

637
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,700
Sister.

638
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,180
Sister, get up.

639
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,700
We can't live without you.

640
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,820
We can't live without you.

641
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,780
Sister, get up.

642
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,220
Get up, A'Yan.

643
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,100
Get up, please.

644
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,580
Get up, sister.

645
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,340
Please.

646
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,980
The Sheng family was in danger.

647
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,220
The whole family was destroyed in a single night.

648
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,140
But they didn't expect that

649
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,860
I would send you away secretly

650
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,740
and leave the Xia family a bloodline.

651
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,220
I know you can't accept it.

652
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,540
But all the signs show that

653
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,820
you are the heir of the Xia family.

654
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,780
The Xia family?

655
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,300
I'm Xia Ran's granddaughter.

656
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,620
Will she be in danger?

657
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,580
Don't tell anyone about this.

658
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,500
If they know your identity,

659
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,580
they will make a big deal out of you.

660
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,260
I'll talk to your master first.

661
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,180
Mother.

662
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,660
We have been living together for more than ten years.

663
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,820
Although you were naughty when you were young,

664
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,700
you have been with me for so many years.

665
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,260
You have been trying to find your family all these years.

666
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,820
All right.

667
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,500
Now you have found them.

668
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,180
We have settled a problem.

669
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
But it's too soon.

670
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,700
I feel sad.

671
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,540
Mother.

672
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,140
Thank you for your care and support all these years.

673
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,340
Although I have found my family,

674
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,700
I will never leave you.

675
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,140
I will never leave you.

676
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,660
Don't worry.

677
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,140
I will always be your daughter.

678
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,860
I will never leave you.

679
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,660
I will always be your daughter.

680
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,980
Mother.

681
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,900
Mother.

682
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,900
Jin Xia.

683
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,820
Is she my sister's child?

684
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,060
How could it be Jin Xia?

685
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,340
No.

686
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,700
You are so good.

687
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,980
Ling.

688
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,100
Brother Yang, why did you lie to me?

689
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,900
I lied to you?

690
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,660
When I was in Hangzhou,

691
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,820
I have found out that Jin Xia is my sister's daughter.

692
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,060
Why did you say no?

693
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,060
Ling.

694
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,580
Stop denying it.

695
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,940
I have found the evidence to prove Jin Xia's identity.

696
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,020
You know that

697
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,180
I only have Jin Xia's family.

698
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,660
Why did you lie to me that she is missing?

699
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,660
And you took us to find her?

700
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,940
I did it for your good.

701
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,180
Think about it.

702
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,300
Once Xia's identity is exposed,

703
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,500
her enemies will chase after her.

704
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,340
By then,

705
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,220
they will definitely involve Xia's adoptive mother, Sister Yuan.

706
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,700
After all, they are innocent.

707
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,180
You took care of her before.

708
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,180
You don't need to do it now.

709
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,660
Ling.

710
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,100
What do you mean?

711
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,060
Lu Yi has come to propose marriage.

712
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,420
Lu Yi.

713
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,500
Lu Yi.

714
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,620
Lu Yi.

715
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,500
Lu Yi.

716
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,380
Lu Yi.

717
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,100
Lu Yi.

718
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:09,860
Lu Yi.

719
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,660
Lu Yi.

720
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,420
Lu Yi.

721
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,260
Lu Yi.

722
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,020
Lu Yi.

723
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,780
Lu Yi.

724
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,540
Lu Yi.

725
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,260
Lu Yi.

726
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:15,980
Lu Yi.

727
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,660
Lu Yi.

728
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,300
Lu Yi.

729
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,060
Lu Yi.

730
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:18,660
Lu Yi.

731
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,300
Lu Yi.

732
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,060
Lu Yi.

733
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,660
Lu Yi.

734
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,380
Lu Yi.

735
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,180
Lu Yi.

736
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:22,820
Lu Yi.

737
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,660
Lu Yi.

738
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,340
Lu Yi.

739
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,060
Lu Yi.

740
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:25,740
Lu Yi.

741
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,460
Lu Yi.

742
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,260
Lu Yi.

743
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,060
Lu Yi.

744
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,820
Lu Yi.

745
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,540
Lu Yi.

746
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,300
Lu Yi.

747
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:30,980
Lu Yi.

748
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,780
Lu Yi.

749
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,620
Lu Yi.

750
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,540
Lu Yi.

751
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,380
Lu Yi.

752
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,300
Lu Yi.

753
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,100
Lu Yi.

754
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,060
Lu Yi.

755
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,940
Lu Yi.

756
