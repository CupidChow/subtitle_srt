00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeat is still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ah

The Song of Phoenix

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is the control room

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No one, no ghost

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So this ghost ship is actually a base

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Is that oil not for defense

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But for defense

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This city should be destroyed

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The ghost ship is just trying to get a promotion

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Lord Lu, save me

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We can discuss whether to accept the help

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But how many years can the old man wait

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm leaving

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Three years ago, he forced me to marry you

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I ran away from home

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He must be angry with me now

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are my senior

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How can I marry you

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hurry up

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hurry up

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hurry up

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hurry up

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hurry up

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hurry up

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hurry up

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Coming

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hurry up

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hurry up

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We are going to the control room

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Where is the Young Master

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hurry up, find it

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hurry up

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why are you standing there

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Master

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The Young Master just rode a horse and left

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Get me back

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Master

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hurry up

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hurry up

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hurry up

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hurry up

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hurry up

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hurry up

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hurry up

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hurry up

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hurry up

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hurry up

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hurry up

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hurry up

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So you left at the wedding

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why can't you marry me

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know you won't like me

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are a little boy

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My father and your father forced me

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You are filial

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So you agreed to this marriage

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But I can't hurt you forever

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ok, I won't say it

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go back with me

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You want to save Sha Xiuzhu

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have a way

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ok, I will go with you

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I will accept her

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can't do this

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I would rather be a fire that burns

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All my eyes are for you

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Even if you disappear in the end

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
She, you don't have to go through so many times

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The rest of my life is the result of years

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In the moment of loneliness and loneliness

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will finally fall

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The most beautiful moment

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What will happen if two hearts fall apart

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
People always fall apart

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Sister

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You want me to go on a blind date

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Or to see my father

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
General Guanxuan

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Manager Lu

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
General, please

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
General

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
General

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
General

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
General

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You traveled a long way to Yangzhou

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think you must celebrate your father's birthday

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since you know

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I won't be a fool

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I heard that you have a birthday cake for your father

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thanks to you

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You saved this cake for me

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are welcome

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Since we met

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's my duty

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
My father's birthday is coming soon

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to take back this cake

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The case is not solved

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And there are two more birthday cakes that I haven't found

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I can't return the item for now

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Please wait for a few more days

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Manager Lu

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Manager Lu

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You want to eat my stuff

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't you know what will happen to the royal family and the state?

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You should know

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We only obey the emperor

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Lu Yi, you

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But if you don't betray the emperor

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You will be in trouble

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Not to mention

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I will follow the rules when you take the cake

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If you have any problem

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can go to the emperor and tell him about it

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Great

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
In that case

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please solve the case

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Return the cake to me

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't ruin the birthday party

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will do my best

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Father, I am back

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Three years

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Three years

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Father, I am sorry

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am back this time

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I have something important to discuss with you

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You are discussing with me now

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are on the boat and you are fighting with the imperial guards

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Do you know who Lu Yi is?

150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How dare you fight with him

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know it all

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Lu Yi is the son of the current imperial guard, Lu Qing

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How dare you?

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I will send you away tonight

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You should hide in the White Gourd Hall in Suzhou

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I will send someone to pick you up after the storm

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have to do this

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Father, I can't go

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Brother Sha is still in prison

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You still want to solve the case?

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I am here to check the prison

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It is different from ordinary prisons

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There are underground and water wells

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have to be careful

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Father, Brother Sha took the birthday cake

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It is our idea

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He is in danger now

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
How can I ignore him?

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Lu Yi is young

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He is very mature

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is hard to predict

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Don't be rash

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Xing, keep an eye on him

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't let him mess around again

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Father

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Xing, go and call Dr. Shen

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Show him the wound

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You said my father was sick

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He is very energetic

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He is as strong as before

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I know you came back on purpose

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You came back on purpose?

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I am relieved to see you are healthy

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You are still the same

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You are wronged or wronged

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You always help others

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You are always so kind

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I am a man

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can handle this

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Father reminded me

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I have to do something

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have two more Shenzhen steel

194
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What? Why didn't you say it earlier?

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If I said it earlier

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
My father would be angry at me

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Lu is in Yangzhou now

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have to find a place

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
to hide the stuff

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Leave it to me

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I will handle it

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Xia, let's not go out

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We have been out for so long

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If we don't go back, father will be worried

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go out

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The Yangzhou is the most

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
impoverished place

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They say there are many beautiful girls in Yangzhou

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The Yangzhou is 10 miles away

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's true

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Where is beautiful?

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You don't know

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They say the beauty in Yangzhou

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
is so beautiful

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Stop laughing

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's too dangerous

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We have a case to investigate

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let's not go

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How about going to Qifen Pavilion?

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You said there are many delicious food

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Qifen Pavilion? Okay, let's go

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Go

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Qifen Pavilion, it's here

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's go

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Go in

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You have to be serious

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't lie to me

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Okay

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's okay

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's okay

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They will come out from here

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Come on

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Everyone, come to the Pavilion

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Come and have a look

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
How is it?

236
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's really good

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Mr. Tang, no, Mr. Xie

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's go to have a look

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have been here for a month

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let me go

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You don't give me money

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There is no such person

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You say sorry

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Stop looking at the crowd

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Go back

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You see

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't have to drink in your house

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Don't talk nonsense

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Let go

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You see

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He still doesn't admit it

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He is too good

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Who doesn't admit it?

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I haven't been back to Yangzhou for three years

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will eat if you say I eat

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The food is in your stomach

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You are playing tricks

262
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Everyone, give a pavilion

264
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Everyone

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Say more

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Mr. Xia, we have been waiting for too long

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We have to send father some snacks

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's go back

269
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's too much

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Girl

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you remember me?

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We met at the dock that day

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Big beard

275
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You are the young chief of the Wu'an Gang

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes, it's me

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This beard is quite bad

278
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
OK

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't talk about that useless heart

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You hurry up and help me to judge

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You see

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He is too unreasonable

283
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't know what's going on

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How can I judge

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Old man, what are you talking about?

286
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are like this

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You are dealing with me like this

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Jin Xia

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Are you OK?

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Am I OK?

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Come

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Wipe wipe wipe

293
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Does the water smell good?

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I tell you

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Do you know who he is?

296
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You are too much

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He is the subordinate of the six mountains

298
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
How can you do this?

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm so sorry

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm so sorry

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't want the money

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't want the money

303
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't run

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't want it

305
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I just want to watch a play

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So big

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Wipe wipe wipe

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I thought you would avoid it

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
My eyes are so big

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can see your back

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You are all wet

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is because of me

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't be irresponsible

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
How about this?

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I will pay for your clothes

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Two taels

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Two taels

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Five taels

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Five taels

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You underestimate me

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's go

322
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I will take you to the famous shop to buy clothes

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No no no

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What?

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Big Yang

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You send the snacks back first

327
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Don't say it's too embarrassing

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I will let him pay

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Go

330
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Send the snacks

331
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Dad should scold me again

332
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't pull the rice

333
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is the best way

334
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I will wash my clothes

335
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Young master, you are here

336
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Go ahead

337
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We will pick it ourselves

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Go

339
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is what I wear

340
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's what the girl wears

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Pick one

342
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Then you change your clothes

343
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I will let the boss wash it for you

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You really buy everything I pick?

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Look at me

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think this one is suitable for you

348
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Take it away

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's not good

350
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Isn't this style pretty?

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This dress is okay

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Very feminine

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Not bad

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Why don't you try all these on?

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I think these styles and colors are all good

356
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Come on, go quickly

357
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't catch a cold

358
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hurry up

359
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't peek

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Who is looking?

361
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Lu Jingli wants to interrogate Sha Xiuzhu

362
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Let me take someone there

363
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What?

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Lu Jingli from the capital

365
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Don't you know?

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Please

367
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Lu Jingli from the capital

368
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Lord Lu sent someone to interrogate Sha Xiuzhu

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You should serve him well

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes

371
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Bring him out quickly

372
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Lord Lu is impatient

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay

374
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Sir

375
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Is he from the Southern Provincial Office?

376
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Stop talking

377
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Who else comes to the capital

378
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
except for Lord Lu from the Southern Provincial Office?

379
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Sir, I'm sorry

380
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm here to ask you

381
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
to come to Haihan

382
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Go and get someone

383
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Lord Lu is very anxious

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yes, sir

385
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Sir, please wait

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll bring him here now

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hurry up

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What are you doing?

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Let me out

390
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Open the door

391
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You're so small

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
How dare you pretend to be Lord Lu's subordinate?

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Open the door

394
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can't even tell the difference

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
How dare you break into the Provincial Office?

396
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
When Lord Lu comes back

397
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll beat you up

398
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Let me out

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You bastard

400
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You bastard

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's cold

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's cold

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The fire and the sound

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The thunder and lightning are strong

405
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sir

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The explosion sounds like it came from the Provincial Office

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Go and check

408
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes

409
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Junior

410
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Junior

411
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Senior

412
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Senior

413
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Save Brother Sha

414
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's too late

415
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's go

416
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No, Brother Sha is still in jail

417
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's go

418
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Lord Lu

419
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Lord Wei

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I just heard a huge sound

421
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and saw some fire and lightning

422
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What happened?

423
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What happened?

424
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
A bandit was very reckless

425
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He blew up the horse and caused a riot in order to escape from prison

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Then he opened the door

427
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and tried to take the prisoner away

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Did the prisoner run away?

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No

430
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Please

431
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Stop

432
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm Lord Lu's subordinate

433
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
How dare a bandit come back?

434
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Sir

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You misunderstood

436
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You got it wrong

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm an official

438
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm a constable from the capital

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're in jail instead of working with him

440
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Now?

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're still trying to deny it

442
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What are you talking about?

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If you don't believe me

444
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
you can ask Lord Lu

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I came from the capital with him

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Arrest him

447
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You

448
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Wait

449
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Sir

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You

451
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You

452
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You

453
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You

454
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Sir

455
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He's suspicious

456
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm suspicious

457
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He's a bandit

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Sir, how could I be a bandit?

459
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know it best

460
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Please explain it to them

461
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He's a constable from the six gates of the capital

462
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He came to Yangzhou with me

463
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Right?

464
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I told you you got the wrong person

465
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But

466
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
he's not my subordinate

467
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't know him

468
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If he's suspicious

469
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you must investigate it

470
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't delay it

471
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Sir

472
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Did you misunderstand something?

473
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't know what you did

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sir

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The thunder is strong

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's so strong

477
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If I were a bandit

478
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I would have the gunpowder

479
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I can smell it

480
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I can smell it

481
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Sir

482
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It doesn't smell like gunpowder

483
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Sir

484
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You don't go

485
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You want to stay in the prison

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Keep it

487
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes

488
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes

489
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Sir

490
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If you don't have anything else

491
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll leave now

492
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Zhao Nv

493
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Officer Yuan

494
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Don't you think you should explain

495
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
what happened today?

496
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sir

497
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What did the bandit do?

498
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Jinxia

499
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What's going on?

500
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Sir

501
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The token is the same as the bandit's

502
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The bandit killed the host in your name

503
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's why we let him in

504
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Give me your token

505
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Sir

506
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The token of the six mountains contains black iron

507
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's impossible to break it

508
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's fake

509
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
How come?

510
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I've been carrying this token

511
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When did it become fake?

512
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
What's your relationship with the prison?

513
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I don't know who the prison is

514
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
How can I know?

515
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Tell me the truth

516
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What did you say?

517
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I know, Sir

518
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You're afraid that you can't catch the bandit

519
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and you'll be humiliated

520
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You want to blame me?

521
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Xia'er

522
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I think you're not listening to orders

523
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You're so ignorant

524
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You should be punished

525
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm ignorant?

526
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes

527
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm responsible for the problem

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
with the token

529
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But it doesn't mean

530
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm in cahoots with the bandit

531
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You're so ignorant

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
that you're so cruel

533
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Am I ignorant?

534
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Or you think you're too selfish?

535
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Xia'er

536
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Don't talk nonsense

537
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Sir

538
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
With your ability

539
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
How can you let such an important thing

540
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
be replaced easily?

541
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Thank you for your compliment

542
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Now we have evidence and evidence

543
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Do you think I'm praising you?

544
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Evidence and evidence?

545
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So you're a person who

546
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
turns the wrong side

547
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Since it's necessary

548
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll admit it

549
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, I know the bandit

550
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I gave them the token

551
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I took their plan for them

552
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Shut up

553
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Dad

554
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Dad

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sir

556
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's the Yangmou School

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Jinxia said all the bad words

558
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Please don't take it seriously

559
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I can ignore this

560
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But I don't need you

561
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to pack up my things

562
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and leave

563
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Sir

564
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Just go

565
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I won't do this

566
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Xia'er

567
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Jinxia

568
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Jinxia

569
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I know it has nothing to do with

570
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,040
the

571
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Sir

572
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Sir

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Sir

574
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Sir

575
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Sir

576
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Sir

577
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Sir

578
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Sir

579
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Sir

580
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,960
You didn't take the day off for him and you chose not to meet him.

581
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,700
It was a good decision.

582
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,580
Jinxiu couldn't bear to see you suffer like that.

583
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,920
However, you took a good stand.

584
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,740
Well, I will not be confident about it at all.

585
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,740
How can you continue going through all these things as if you have known him

586
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,300
When you're not sad,

587
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,580
you must think about it.

588
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,820
When did you

589
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,340
get the badge from someone?

590
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,740
Pick one.

591
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,780
Then change your clothes.

592
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,140
I'll ask the boss to wash it for you.

593
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,820
It's him.

594
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,860
Who is he?

595
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,420
It's him.

596
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,700
Who is he?

597
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,180
I've a clue.

598
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,260
There is a letter.

599
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,540
Full volume.

600
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,300
Right, you can meet the boss's purpose.

601
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,420
I have no choice.

602
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,820
Losers take the big picture hours paid out for muchrous money.

603
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,580
What's the point of reading through the letters?

604
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,100
The boss MIXS is at work.

605
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
That old bastard.

606
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,100
Does he want to go on a almond farm?

607
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,980
I've got to go.

608
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,300
Only to lose.

609
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
I dare not show up.

610
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,700
I will come to his Wu'an Sect every day

611
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
to make him restless.

612
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,500
Xia Yu, don't be so rude.

613
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,300
Go back with me.

614
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,500
No, I have to escape.

615
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,700
Let's see if you have the ability.

616
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,300
Who came to take care of you?

617
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
It turns out to be Yuan Bu Kuan and Yang Bu Kuan from the Six Dining Faction.

618
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,900
Where is Xie Xiao?

619
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,700
What is the matter that Yuan Bu Kuan is looking for my junior brother?

620
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,700
You can tell me.

621
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
I will tell him for you.

622
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,500
Chief Shangguan,

623
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,100
this is a private matter between me and Xie Xiao.

624
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,700
I must see him today.

625
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,100
Please don't interfere.

626
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,900
Yuan Bu Kuan is so arrogant.

627
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
He is trying to take over my Wu'an Sect.

628
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
I must take care of him.

629
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,900
If you want to see Xie Xiao,

630
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,900
you have to go through me first.

631
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,700
Why is Yuan Bu Kuan so virtuous today?

632
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,900
Why do you come to my Wu'an Sect to see me?

633
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,500
You finally come out.

634
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,300
Come back to the yamen with me.

635
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Put down the knife.

636
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,500
I didn't make any mistake.

637
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,500
Why do you arrest me?

638
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,700
Young Master is really good at pretending.

639
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,620
You stole my card and went to investigate the case of the

640
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,900
unruly and the criminal.

641
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,500
What did Yuan Bu Kuan say?

642
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,500
Yesterday, my junior brother never left the gang.

643
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,300
How could he be the thief of the unruly?

644
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Do you remember this?

645
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,900
You gave it to me.

646
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,300
What?

647
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,700
Is it not suitable?

648
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Don't you know what you did?

649
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,900
I will give it back to you.

650
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Go back to the yamen.

651
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,700
I won't go.

652
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,100
Go or not?

653
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,700
Go or not?

654
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,500
Senior sister, this has nothing to do with you.

655
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Jinxia, calm down.

656
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,900
Don't be impulsive.

657
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,500
I don't believe he dares to hit me.

658
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,500
Don't talk nonsense.

659
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,300
Go.

660
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,300
Hit me.

661
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Hit here.

662
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,500
Hit me.

663
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,700
Hit me.

664
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,500
You.

665
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,900
Xia'er.

666
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,500
Master.

667
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,300
Father.

668
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,300
Master.

669
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,700
He is the thief of the unruly.

670
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,900
I want to catch him back.

671
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,700
Master.

672
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,500
This was found by the wall after the investigation.

673
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,300
Master Shangguan.

674
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,900
Master Xie Shaogang.

675
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,300
Master Xie Shaogang.

676
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,700
Master Xie Shaogang.

677
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Master Xie Shaogang.

678
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,100
Wu Anbang.

679
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,900
What's going on?

680
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,300
Say it.

681
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,500
Say it.

682
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,500
Brother Dai Li.

683
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,900
Master.

684
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
It's not about Xie Xiao.

685
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
I asked him to change the card of Yuan Bu Kui

686
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,900
to get the master Sha Xiu.

687
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,700
Senior.

688
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,300
Xie.

689
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,100
You don't have to speak for him.

690
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,900
I know my son's character.

691
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,700
Do you think I'm a fool?

692
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,900
I've told you many times.

693
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Lu Yi can't be the victim.

694
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
He is just a father

695
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,500
who works as the commander of the imperial guards.

696
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,100
No matter what,

697
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,500
Wu Anbang is the first royal clan of Cao Yun.

698
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,700
Father, do you have to be so afraid of him?

699
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,700
You are against me.

700
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,500
If you don't, I'll kill you.

701
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
It's okay.

702
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,100
He is a grown up.

703
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,900
He won't be a fool if he keeps beating him.

704
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,900
Look at him.

705
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
He is not a grown up.

706
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,500
He made such a big trouble.

707
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,100
I will teach him a lesson.

708
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,500
He will lose his family in the future.

709
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,100
He is right.

710
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,500
He is like you.

711
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,300
If you are obedient,

712
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,900
can you take down this family business?

713
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
About this matter,

714
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,100
before Lord Lu doubts Wu Anbang,

715
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
you should fight.

716
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,700
No.

717
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Brother Shiya hasn't been saved yet.

718
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
You little bastard.

719
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,900
You still want to make trouble for me?

720
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,500
Brother Baili, come here.

721
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,300
Sit down.

722
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,700
Brother Yang,

723
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,900
I can only watch him.

724
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,100
What's the situation?

725
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,900
Please tell me.

726
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,700
We are brothers.

727
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
It's my duty.

728
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
But

729
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,100
it's my duty to save him.

730
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,300
If it goes wrong,

731
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,500
I can't guarantee it.

732
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,900
Yes, yes.

733
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Okay, okay.

734
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,500
Let's not talk about this.

735
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,100
Yue, Xia,

736
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,500
I pay my respects to Uncle Xie.

737
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,300
I pay my respects to Uncle Xie.

738
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,700
Is he your son?

739
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,100
Yes.

740
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,900
It's been more than ten years.

741
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,900
Father,

742
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
do you know Master Xie?

743
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,900
Your father and I are old friends.

744
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
At that time, we...

745
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,300
We are not talking about the past.

746
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,100
This queen...

747
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
You don't know her?

748
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,900
It was her

749
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,700
who took Xiao'er to fight.

750
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Xiao'er was beaten to death.

751
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,900
Bixi worm.

752
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
Deng Gongxia.

753
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,300
It's you.

754
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,500
Why is it you?

755
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,100
Look at these kids.

756
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
They are so familiar.

757
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,300
Okay, okay.

758
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Let them talk.

759
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,100
Okay, I'll drink with you.

760
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,900
Let's go.

761
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,500
Please.

762
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,700
Please.

763
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
Xie Yuanyuan.

764
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,300
Yuan Daxia.

765
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Brother Yang.

766
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Brother Yang.

767
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,900
Brother Xie.

768
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,100
Brother Yang.

769
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,900
Long time no see.

770
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,100
Long time no see.

771
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,500
Welcome.

772
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,700
This is my son, Xie Xiao.

773
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,500
Nice to meet you, Uncle Yang.

774
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,700
Nice to meet you, Uncle Yang.

775
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,300
Master.

776
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
You are so old.

777
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,500
Xia'er, nice to meet you, Uncle Xie.

778
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Nice to meet you, Uncle Xie.

779
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,300
Little girl.

780
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,100
This is your brother Xie Xiao.

781
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,900
Okay, have fun.

782
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Brother Xie, please.

783
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,700
Okay.

784
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,500
Please.

785
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,500
Why are you so fat?

786
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,700
How dare you say I'm fat?

787
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,500
How dare you push me?

788
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
What are you doing?

789
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,900
It hurts.

790
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,900
Did he really bite you?

791
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,500
This girl is a queen.

792
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
She bites me when she sees me.

793
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
She doesn't say anything when she bites me.

794
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,300
You are jealous of my good teeth.

795
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Are you two reconciled now?

796
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,500
I don't believe it.

797
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Don't think that you can break off the relationship with me.

798
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,900
I won't mind you.

799
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,500
Master said he won't catch you.

800
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
I can stop you.

801
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,900
But you stole my card.

802
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,700
It's not over.

803
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,900
How can you be unreasonable?

804
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
I'm unreasonable.

805
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,100
Who is unreasonable?

806
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Wait.

807
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
Why are you arguing again?

808
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,100
Okay, tell me.

809
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,500
How can you forgive me?

810
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
When will I resume my post?

811
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,500
When will we be even?

812
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,300
I have a way.

813
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
I can make you resume your post.

814
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
Who?

815
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
You...

816
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
You two talk.

817
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,900
You are like this.

818
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Then you are like this.

819
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
You can't touch me.

820
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
You are right.

821
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
If you are like this, he will forgive you.

822
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,100
Excuse me, master.

823
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
I have something to tell you.

824
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Come in.

825
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,700
I'm wrong about the card.

826
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
You didn't wrong me.

827
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,300
I shouldn't have brought my temper into work.

828
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
I didn't help you.

829
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,900
I also caused you trouble.

830
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
I deserve to die.

831
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Get up.

832
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Master, you are right.

833
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,300
I don't deserve to cooperate with you.

834
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
So,

835
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,900
I have packed my things

836
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,900
and ready to go back to the capital.

837
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,900
I thank you for taking care of me.

838
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,900
After I go back to the capital,

839
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,900
I will remember your teachings

840
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
and be a good person.

841
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
I will remember your teachings

842
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
and be a good person.

843
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Master, I'm leaving.

844
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
I'm leaving.

845
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Wait.

846
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Master, you don't have to keep me.

847
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,900
I don't deserve to be here.

848
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
It's late.

849
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
I will leave tomorrow.

850
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,900
See you.

851
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
I'm leaving.

852
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,700
Master, can you stop spinning?

853
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,700
It's not working.

854
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I have to find another way.

855
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
I don't believe I can't get him.

856
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,700
You can't get him.

857
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Who are you helping?

858
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
You are helping me or the outsider?

859
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I'm just asking for help.

860
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
You want me to leave?

861
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,700
Go.

862
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I...

863
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Yuan Daxia.

864
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
Where are you from?

865
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,700
I wonder what you are doing here.

866
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,700
How is my meat?

867
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Is it good?

868
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
You are so bad.

869
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
You are trying to trick me.

870
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
You stole my cards and gave me ideas.

871
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
I have to leave tomorrow.

872
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Why is it not good?

873
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Then I will apologize to you.

874
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
What's the use of that?

875
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
How?

876
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,700
I will treat you to the best night snacks in Yangzhou.

877
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,700
Are you trying to trick me?

878
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,700
I'm that kind of person.

879
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,700
You know me.

880
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,700
Who knows?

881
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Listen.

882
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
The night snacks in Yangzhou are so good.

883
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Dried fish, soup buns, meatballs, wine.

884
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
It's so good.

885
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
I promise you to treat me to dinner.

886
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
But it doesn't mean I will forgive you.

887
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,700
Let's go.

888
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,700
Let's go.

889
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,700
No.

890
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
We can't go to the front door.

891
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,700
We have to turn around.

892
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Go.

893
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Go.

894
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
You are so strong.

895
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
You kicked me.

896
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Fill it up.

897
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I'm full.

898
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
You are a girl.

899
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Why do you want to be a pawn?

900
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
You even messed with the Imperial Guards.

901
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
Why can't I be a pawn in a girl's family?

902
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
You are the senior sister and the master of the hall.

903
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,700
You are so ungrateful.

904
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,700
Xie Yuan Yuan.

905
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Your father is sick.

906
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
You just let him be.

907
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,700
But you saved the brother of Jie Yi.

908
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
I can't explain it.

909
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
What are you talking about?

910
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
My father is fine.

911
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Master Xie is so worried.

912
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,700
The martial artist is so slow.

913
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
But he has short breath.

914
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
He is short and weak.

915
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
Didn't you notice that

916
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,700
when he hit you,

917
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,700
his action was exaggerated but he was weak?

918
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,700
You are so annoying.

919
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,700
And his power is

920
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,700
so high.

921
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,700
Do you know who Lu Yi is?

922
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
How dare you fight with him?

923
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
There is Shao Yin in the sword and the chest.

924
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
Most people with poor heart and lungs die.

925
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,700
You...

926
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
What do you mean?

927
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Master Lu is good at martial arts.

928
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,700
He is so scheming.

929
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,700
We are brothers.

930
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
Listen to me.

931
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
Don't make trouble for him.

932
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
I will.

933
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
I know my father.

934
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
But Shao Yin has been taking care of me.

935
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,700
We have been married.

936
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
We have never done anything bad.

937
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Shao Yin was arrested

938
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,700
because I don't like the father and son of the sword.

939
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,700
They are so rude.

940
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,700
I insisted to kidnap Sheng Chenggang.

941
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,700
How can I ignore Shao Yin?

942
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Yuan, don't worry.

943
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,700
I won't get you into trouble.

944
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,700
You really want to kill Xiu Zhu?

945
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Yes.

946
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,700
Leave Jin Xia to me.

947
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,700
You can go now.

948
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
Can you take care of people?

949
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,700
Make some tea for him.

950
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
He is sober.

951
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,700
Do you hear me?

952
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,700
A bunch of people can't stand a single one.

953
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
A bunch of useless people.

954
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,700
I should die.

955
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,700
I will never forget you.

956
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,700
I will never forget you.

957
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,700
I will never forget you.

958
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,700
I will never forget you.

959
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,700
I will never forget you.

960
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,700
I will never forget you.

961
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,700
I will never forget you.

962
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,700
I will never forget you.

963
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,700
I will never forget you.

964
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,700
I will never forget you.

965
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,700
