YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separated by two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I just heard from the butler

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that Secretary Lu

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
has returned the gift I sent

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He will return the gift

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
As I expected

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
However

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
he didn't send Mrs. Si and Mrs. Lian back

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It means he didn't reject

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the post of governor completely

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is a good thing

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We can only wait for the Secretary Lu

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We can only wait for the Secretary Lu

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sir

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sir

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The food has arrived

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please go and collect it yourself

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Zhi Han

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You go with me

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sir

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What can I do for you?

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sit down and talk

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What did you find from those two girls?

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's a long story

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I tell you

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It depends on me

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Our six Sha Men's case

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is much more complicated than yours

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's not a threat to be able to get it out

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I like it

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You girls are naturally

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
put down your guard

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Tell me

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They are both

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the wives of Wu Shou Xu

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They know a lot about

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the affairs of the Wu family

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a pity

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that they are all

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
women who are jealous

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sir

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wu Shou Xu

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
has given you his own woman

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He is very affectionate to you

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Go on

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go on

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There are so many women

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
in Wu Shou Xu's family

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And their daily clothes

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a lot of money

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It seems that

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wu Shou Xu

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
is not a kind person

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He is not clean

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
By the way

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I heard from them

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that the woman next to Wu Shou Xu

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
is not a woman

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but a man

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They are all jealous

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
of the position

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wu Shou Xu has in his heart

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Who?

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xu Wei

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Xu Zhi Han

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Xu Zhi Han

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I heard from them

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that one day

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wu Shou Xu called the generals

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to check the military affairs

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Others can't go in

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But Xu Zhi Han

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
broke in without knocking

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He went around

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
without saying anything

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If it was someone else

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
he would have been dragged out

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and beaten to death

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But Wu Shou Xu

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
didn't mind him

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He made his women

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
jealous and jealous

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's just

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
some tricks

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Nothing to worry about

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But for the things outside

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't know

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But there is one thing

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think it's a clue

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They mentioned

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
last year was the Mid-Autumn Festival

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wu Shou Xu was in a good mood

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
When he was at home

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
he promised them

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to take them to Puto Mountain

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
at the end of the year

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mid-Autumn Festival

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Wang Zhi was arrested

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
in September last year

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The pirates have been making trouble

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Puto Mountain is a island

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No one dares to take risks

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and make a fuss

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Since he said that

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
it was at the end of the year

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
At least it shows

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
he has a great confidence

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
in the pirates

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why is Wang Zhi so sure

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that he will be arrested?

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Wang Ma Zi also said

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Wu Shou Xu sent his wife

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to the pirates

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have asked the government to check

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was before the Mid-Autumn Festival last year

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wu Shou Xu's wife and son went to Mount Zhou

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
At that time

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mao Hai Feng was also in Mount Zhou

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Since then

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
he has never come back

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It seems that

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
there is a connection

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wu Shou Xu

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
seems to have

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
colluded with the pirates

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In this case

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sir, tomorrow

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
should we

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
send those two girls back?

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why should we send them back?

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wu Shou Xu is so romantic

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
that he sent them back

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
just one night

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's so embarrassing

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sir

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't you really like

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sister Sisi and Sister Lian Lian?

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are smiling so warmly

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because you are so beautiful

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I feel so happy

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They even asked me

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
about your hobby

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am so fond of you

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Really?

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How did you answer them?

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I said

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am a fan of you

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How did you answer them?

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I said

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
My master is not a woman

169
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But he is interested in money

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He is interested in money

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
At that time in Yangzhou

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you knew I was poor

174
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You even asked me

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to pay the rent of the boat

176
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you always cussed at my salary

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You are a thief

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
At the end of the bridge

180
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
who was so shameless

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and had to take away

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the two taels of silver from me?

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't remember

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who was so shameless?

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You smashed my stall

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I was so far away from you

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You gave me

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
so little money

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was so annoyed with you

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I wanted to get rid of you

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Sir

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you really like

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Sister Zhao Yao

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and you are willing to send them back?

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think I will go back

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

197
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you jealous?

198
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No?

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But with your face and body

201
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you can't compare with them

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't you worry?

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can't compare with them

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
They are so beautiful

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you really like them

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will keep them

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are still jealous

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I saw you

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
called me sister

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I thought you forgot me

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Who forgot you?

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sir

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I have to go now

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sister

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Sister

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Did you cry?

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why are your eyes so red?

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Nothing

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Maybe it's windy and sand outside

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
My eyes are a little uncomfortable

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What can I do for you?

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Master ordered

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
all the disciples of Nan Shaolin

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to go to the coast to visit the pirates

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why did master

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
order suddenly?

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The pirates in Jiangzhe

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
are in a bad shape

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and the people are in trouble

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The governor of Zhezhi, Wu Shou Xu

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
went to Nan Shaolin Temple

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to ask master

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
to send disciples to protect the people

234
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sister

235
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you thinking?

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I am thinking

237
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
you just came back

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I won't agree

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to visit the pirates

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Since I have already

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
retired

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will go this time

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I am a disciple

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
of the Su family

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Master ordered

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't disobey

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And as a man

248
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I am also a man

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
who protects the country

250
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have to do this

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's also my duty

252
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to protect the country

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then no matter what

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I have to prepare

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
for you

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you

258
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
leave without saying goodbye

259
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
like three years ago

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I am afraid you can't stand it

261
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I will write to my father

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
right now

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We will leave tomorrow

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Sister

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Before leaving

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I want to say goodbye to Jin Xia

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Master

268
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Master

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Wu Shou Xu has invited

270
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Shaolin monks and soldiers

271
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
to go to fight against the pirates

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
In this way

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yu Dayong

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
will increase his military power

275
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Besides

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The supplies from the court

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
to supply Yu Dayong

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
have also entered

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the military warehouse in Hangzhou

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I think

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
they will be sent

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay

283
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The supplies are sufficient

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The army

285
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is not afraid of

286
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the fear of the soldiers

287
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
caused by lack of supplies

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mao Haifeng wants to win

289
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm afraid it's difficult

290
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Master

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are we going to

292
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
help Mao Haifeng?

293
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
After all

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
he won Yu Dayong

295
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wu Shou Xu

296
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
will be reduced to

297
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
a useless man

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
In this way

299
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
his culture

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
will be affected

301
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He will lose his power

302
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I believe that

303
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
he will offer wine to the emperor

304
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but he will give the rest to the master

305
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He should be taught

306
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He should be taught

307
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But why should I

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
help him

309
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
to beat his own people?

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But Master

311
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We are not

312
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
cooperating with Mao Haifeng

313
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to open the mine?

314
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I cooperate with him

315
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
just for

316
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
money

317
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can help

318
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
or teach him

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
as I like

320
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm free to depend on him

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You are right

322
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry

323
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yan Feng

324
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I asked you to investigate

325
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How is the investigation

326
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
of the granddaughter of the Xia family?

327
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have sent people

328
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to investigate

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
After the criminal

330
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
threw the child away

331
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the child

332
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
was sent

333
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
into the pond

334
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But now the pond

335
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
has been closed

336
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If it's closed

337
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
it's very likely

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
that someone will take it away

339
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You should investigate

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Before Lin Ling

341
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and others find it

342
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
bring the person back

343
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, Master

344
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Go

345
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I propose a toast

346
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wish you all

347
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
a smooth investigation

348
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and a safe return

349
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Come

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sister Shangguan

351
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't take

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yang Yue's words to heart

353
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can't be distracted

354
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
on the battlefield

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Otherwise, it's dangerous

356
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you have anything

357
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
just say it

358
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I, Yuan Jinxia

359
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
will help you

360
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Please tell Yang Yue

361
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
whether he can

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
return safely

363
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If he doesn't

364
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
he will die in the sea of salt

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I hope he can

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
put incense on me

367
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
when he is in his prime

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's a token of my appreciation

369
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Pei, Pei, Pei

370
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Sister

371
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We haven't started the war yet

372
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You are just saying these

373
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Do you want to win?

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Idiot

375
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I didn't say anything wrong

376
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Sister

377
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will bring you the words

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Thank you

379
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yuan Jinxia

380
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Say it

381
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If I don't come back

382
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
this time

383
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you must do

384
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
my last rites

385
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Pei, Pei, Pei

386
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What last rites?

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Your last rites

388
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
are your father's

389
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not my turn

390
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I am going to go on a expedition

391
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why don't you worry about me?

392
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Be careful

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The pirates we have met

394
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
are dangerous

395
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There are many swords and swords on the battlefield

396
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You must be careful

397
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You must return safely

398
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,020
and don't let any

399
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Be assured

400
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't worry

401
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
For you

402
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I will come back safely

403
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Come

404
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Come

405
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Safe

406
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Safe

407
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Safe

408
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Sister

409
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Tomorrow

410
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Sister Shangguan and the others

411
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
will go to the coast to fight the pirates

412
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I

413
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What are you talking about?

414
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't you go to see her?

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They are in danger

416
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Even though

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Sister Shangguan is good at martial arts

418
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
there are no swords and swords on the battlefield

419
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She will die in the battle

420
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Sister Shangguan

421
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
asked me to bring you a message

422
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
She said

423
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
she didn't know

424
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
if she could come back safely

425
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If she died in the battle

426
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
she hoped

427
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you could burn incense for her

428
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
when you were in Qingming

429
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's a way to show your affection

430
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Some people

431
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you don't go to see them now

432
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You may not see them

433
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
for the rest of your life

434
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Maybe for the rest of your life

435
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
In your heart

436
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you only think about me

437
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
right?

438
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Only you

439
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You won't leave me

440
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I will never

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
leave you

442
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You said you would

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
take responsibility for me

444
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't you want to take responsibility?

445
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's good to be alive

446
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yang Yue

447
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I was wrong about you

448
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you really think so

449
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I have nothing to say

450
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't care if you really like me

451
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Sister Shangguan

452
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I have made a vow

453
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I will never leave you

454
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yang Yue

455
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
These days

456
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you have done some things

457
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Have you forgotten your vow?

458
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hurry up

459
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hurry up

460
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Come on

461
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Come on

462
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Second master

463
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Miss Zhai is here

464
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Here you are

465
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You fell from such a high cliff

466
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and you are still alive

467
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You are so lucky

468
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't know why you

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
come to me today

470
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you want me to

471
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
bring something to you?

472
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Not you

473
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But I have something

474
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
good for you

475
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's go

476
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I, Dong Qisheng

477
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
never believe

478
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the good things

479
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that come from heaven

480
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But since Miss Zhai is here

481
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
just tell me

482
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I have a good news for you

483
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Go and catch the person

484
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that you want

485
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Then you can

486
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
get the credit

487
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Who?

488
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Lin Ling

489
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Who is she?

490
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I haven't heard about her

491
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
At that time

492
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
the person who helped you

493
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
to keep Lan Yu Zan alive

494
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
was Lin Ling's senior brother

495
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You wanted to

496
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
catch Lin Ling

497
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but you failed

498
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If you

499
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
catch Lin Ling

500
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and give her to you

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
you will make a great contribution

502
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It is a good chance

503
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
to make a contribution

504
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But I also heard that

505
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Miss Zhai

506
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
doesn't give people any benefits

507
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You can easily

508
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
tell me where Lin Ling is

509
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and also try to

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
persuade me to catch her

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I am afraid that

512
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
it is not that simple

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Tell me

514
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What are you up to?

515
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Lin Ling is my enemy

516
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You want to take advantage of me

517
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to avenge yourself

518
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes

519
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Avenge?

520
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Recently, Wu Shou Xu

521
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
got a batch of grains

522
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
to transport them

523
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
to the front line of the anti-war

524
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to support the army

525
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If the grains are gone

526
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and the army is gone

527
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
do you think the big boss

528
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
will have a bigger chance?

529
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You mean

530
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
you want to negotiate with me?

531
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It seems that

532
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
you are not interested in my proposal

533
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Forget it

534
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Wait

535
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I haven't finished yet

536
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Miss Zhai

537
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why are you in a hurry?

538
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If you want to destroy the grains

539
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I will go to catch Lin Ling

540
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We can cooperate in different ways

541
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What do you think?

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Why do you want me

543
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
to destroy the grains?

544
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Wu Shou Xu

545
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
is very wary of us

546
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We are not very active

547
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He will know it soon

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If you want to do it

549
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
it will be different

550
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He doesn't know who you are

551
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
so he doesn't think about it

552
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He is just a little boy

553
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but he is a little bit wary of you

554
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Did you open the lock?

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No

556
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Go in and have a look

557
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Who is it?

558
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Hurry up

559
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hurry up

560
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Hurry up

561
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Morning, sir

562
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Morning

563
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Morning

564
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Thank you

565
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Sir

566
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What's up?

567
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The grain warehouse

568
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
was raided by a criminal last night

569
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Most of the grains were destroyed

570
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Mr. Wu wants to see you

571
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The grains were destroyed?

572
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Do you want to go with me?

573
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Let's go

574
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Mr. Lu, please

575
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Mr. Lu

576
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It smells so good

577
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Sir

578
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Look

579
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This powder

580
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
should be the reason

581
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
that caused the rice to be ruined

582
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Sen Feng

583
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Check what powder it is

584
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and where it comes from

585
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yes

586
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thanks

587
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Anyone Some suspicious

588
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
seen something special?

589
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
As usual

590
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
we wereicles in the warehouse

591
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and ran towards it

592
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The concurrent cop

593
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
let down without calling

594
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Did you see

595
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
how she ran?

596
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No

597
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
There are no wound

598
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
No wounds.

599
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,680
Sir, there's a footprint.

600
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,920
Judging by the size of the footprint,

601
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,880
this person is about five feet four inches tall.

602
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,040
He's probably a woman.

603
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Take me to see the body of the patrol officer.

604
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,320
Please, sir.

605
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,200
Take the body away.

606
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,120
Sir.

607
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,120
Sir, do you think this needle is familiar?

608
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,640
Zhai Lanye?

609
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,240
Zhai Lanye is from Yan Shi Fan.

610
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,920
Could it be that she arranged it?

611
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know.

612
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,720
I just know that she's a woman.

613
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
She's a woman.

614
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
She's a woman.

615
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
She's a woman.

616
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
She's a woman.

617
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
She's a woman.

618
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
She's a woman.

619
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,160
I don't understand.

620
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,360
Wu Shou Xu is a member of Liao Wen Hua.

621
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,720
And Liao Wen Hua is Yan Song's adopted son.

622
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,200
If Wu Shou Xu is defeated,

623
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,160
then the Yan family will be in trouble.

624
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,080
Yan Shi Fan doesn't have to kill her own people.

625
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
Lan Qing Xuan said in the letter that

626
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,120
Liao Wen Hua hid Yan Song from the emperor to offer him lily wine.

627
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,800
She said Yan Song drank lily wine every day.

628
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,520
That's why she's able to live a long life.

629
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,520
After this incident,

630
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,760
although the emperor didn't punish Yan Song,

631
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,520
he still has a place in his heart.

632
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,320
He doesn't trust him anymore.

633
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
So it's a dog-eating dog.

634
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,280
If the Yan family wants to kill Liao Wen Hua,

635
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,520
they should start with Wu Shou Xu first.

636
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,600
No wonder that Mr. Wu

637
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,640
will give gifts and girls in the future.

638
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,840
He's so generous.

639
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,080
It turns out that he's self-reliant and can't rely on him.

640
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,680
If it's just a fight in the official field,

641
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,720
Yan Song only needs to provoke Liao Wen Hua

642
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,800
and Wu Shou Xu to get along.

643
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,160
Why do they send people to destroy the grains

644
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,800
and let us catch the target?

645
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,520
It doesn't seem like Yan Shi Fan's doing.

646
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,200
But if it's not Yan Shi Fan's doing,

647
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,000
why would Zhai Liang Ye do that?

648
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
Si Fu, go and check

649
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,800
who Zhai Liang Ye has been in contact with recently.

650
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,320
Yes.

651
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,240
Mr. Lu,

652
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,120
Mr. Wu asked you to visit his study.

653
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,640
Okay.

654
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
I'll go.

655
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,040
Sir, Mr. Lu is here.

656
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Mr. Lu.

657
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,920
Mr. Wu,

658
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,320
I think this is the one

659
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,600
that everyone often mentions,

660
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,920
Mr. Xu Wei Xu.

661
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,240
Greetings, Mr. Lu.

662
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,520
I'm here to see you.

663
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,360
Greetings, Mr. Lu.

664
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,360
I've heard a lot about you.

665
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,840
It's my pleasure to meet you today.

666
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,760
I'm flattered.

667
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,680
Please sit down.

668
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Lu.

669
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,080
I'm very grateful.

670
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,560
Mr. Wu, you're welcome.

671
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,480
I was in the warehouse just now

672
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,200
and found that the rice was black.

673
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,040
I'm afraid that it's useless now.

674
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,280
If the rice is destroyed,

675
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,320
it will disturb the morale of the army.

676
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,880
In this case,

677
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,520
Mr. Wu, you dare to tell me about this?

678
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,160
Aren't you afraid that I'll report it to His Majesty

679
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,480
and make a crime against you?

680
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,280
I've heard that

681
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,840
Mr. Lu is smart.

682
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,360
You're just saying it.

683
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,080
My internal and external troubles

684
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,640
must be caused by Mr. Lu.

685
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,120
At this time,

686
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,520
I can only get through this case

687
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,880
with Mr. Lu's honesty.

688
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,920
It's hard to say.

689
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,840
It's not a long-term matter

690
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,880
to have no one in the court.

691
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,600
I'll send it to Mr. Yan.

692
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,680
Mr. Wu,

693
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,800
don't forget that

694
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,360
even if the power of the Yan family is great,

695
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,920
the world is still up to His Majesty.

696
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,640
Mr. Lu means that...

697
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,320
The mountain is covered with water, the river is covered with water.

698
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,120
The flowers are blooming, and the village is in full bloom.

699
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,280
By the way,

700
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,600
please take the two ladies

701
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,120
that Mr. Wu sent here back.

702
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
In this situation,

703
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,440
if they are caught,

704
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
it's not good to say something bad.

705
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,320
Okay, I'll send them back immediately.

706
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,960
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

707
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,400
I'll leave now.

708
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,720
Take care.

709
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,920
I'll see Mr. Lu off.

710
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,880
Mr. Lu.

711
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,840
Sir.

712
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,920
Mr. Wu has been training soldiers and horses

713
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,040
for the Japanese pirates for years.

714
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,040
He has a few capable soldiers and officers.

715
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,200
What I'm worried about is not only his appearance,

716
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,440
but also

717
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,600
that if the Japanese pirates stop the governor,

718
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,960
the army will be in danger.

719
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,560
It's like the blood of years is flowing in the East.

720
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,040
In this way,

721
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,800
how long can we stop the Japanese pirates?

722
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,320
Sir.

723
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,800
This gift of Han is not for Mr. Wu alone,

724
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,760
but for the people of Liang and Zhe.

725
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,000
I understand.

726
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,800
I'll do my best.

727
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,960
Okay.

728
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,480
Sir.

729
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
I have a question.

730
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,080
May I ask?

731
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Go ahead.

732
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,640
I've been curious.

733
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,360
My father asked you to leave the mountain.

734
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,760
You refused.

735
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,960
Why do you accept Mr. Wu's invitation?

736
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm a Shaoxing man.

737
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,160
How can I watch the Japanese pirates

738
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,520
when they are in danger?

739
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,000
You're a good man.

740
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,880
You deserve it.

741
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,640
I admire you.

742
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,560
I'll see you out.

743
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,840
Please, Mr. Lu.

744
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,520
Wu Shouxu was identified as a Japanese pirate.

745
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,240
Now he has a problem with the mountain.

746
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,080
The Yan family is in a bad position.

747
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
Sir, he's getting along with you.

748
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,240
I'm afraid he's using you.

749
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,320
Don't worry. I know it.

750
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,680
Aunt Lin.

751
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,160
Where are you going?

752
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,760
I'm going to buy some medicine.

753
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,840
Do you need me to accompany you?

754
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,600
No.

755
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,800
It's nearby.

756
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll be back soon.

757
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,960
By the way, Jinxia.

758
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,120
Go and see your master.

759
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,880
What's wrong with my master?

760
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,040
Yang Yue left.

761
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,000
He didn't even leave a letter.

762
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Yang Yue left?

763
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,360
Your master locked himself in the room.

764
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,760
He didn't open the door.

765
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,640
Go and comfort him.

766
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,360
Sir, I'll go and see my master.

767
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,640
Go.

768
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,040
Master, what are you thinking about?

769
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,200
Xia'er.

770
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
I'm thinking about

771
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,520
you and Yue'er.

772
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,080
I thought

773
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
you're the one I was most worried about.

774
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,720
But in the end, it was Yue'er.

775
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,120
After that, I found out

776
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,960
Yue'er was

777
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,200
so depressed

778
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,240
that she was just hurt.

779
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,240
She became depressed

780
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,520
and had a change of temper.

781
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,400
Master.

782
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,440
Maybe Yang Yue

783
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,840
was just out of his mind

784
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
and didn't think it through.

785
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,440
He'll be fine after some time.

786
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,440
Don't worry.

787
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,640
Xia'er.

788
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,840
Tell me the truth.

789
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,400
Did I

790
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,160
put too much pressure on her?

791
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,080
I let her

792
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,640
follow my plan

793
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,160
since she was a kid.

794
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,280
I didn't let her do

795
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,480
what she wanted to do.

796
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,760
So,

797
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,760
she was not confident about herself.

798
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,000
Master.

799
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,200
Do you want me to tell the truth?

800
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
Of course.

801
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,120
Yang Yue

802
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:34,320
doesn't like to be a

803
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,880
cook.

804
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm not saying

805
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,880
she's not a good cook.

806
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,880
It's just that she's not suitable for it.

807
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,520
It's good that she likes it.

808
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,040
She's suitable for it.

809
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,680
Of course.

810
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,840
It's not my fault.

811
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,920
I did it for her.

812
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,960
Why is Yang

813
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,600
so ignorant?

814
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,600
He didn't even tell me

815
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,120
before he went out.

816
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,760
Oh.

817
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,520
Master.

818
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,480
I'll go to her later.

819
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,840
I'll tell her to come to you.

820
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,800
You can punish her as you like.

821
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,280
I won't speak for her.

822
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,360
Okay, master.

823
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,160
Don't worry.

824
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,000
She's grown up.

825
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,680
She'll be fine.

826
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,880
Master.

827
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,320
I'll have some delicious food with you.

828
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,960
Master.

829
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
You look so pretty when you're smiling.

830
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,960
Did many girls

831
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,000
chase you before?

832
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,200
Yes.

833
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,840
You.

834
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,440
Look.

835
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,360
You're good at talking.

836
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,240
I'm good at talking too.

837
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,640
I'm quite good at eating.

838
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,520
Master.

839
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,680
When will you

840
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,720
be more crazy?

841
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Here we go again.

842
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,720
Let's go.

843
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,760
Let's go to eat.

844
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,800
Let's go to eat delicious food.

845
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,360
Let's go.

846
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,000
Dr. Lin.

847
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,120
You are...

848
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,280
My master wants to invite Dr. Lin

849
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,560
to treat a patient.

850
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,800
Who is your master?

851
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,320
How can he know me?

852
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,960
Dr. Lin will know

853
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,920
when he goes there.

854
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,920
Please.

855
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,080
I won't treat people.

856
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,640
What do you want?

857
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,760
Uncle.

858
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,480
What's wrong?

859
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,520
Dr. Lin has been to the pharmacy for a long time.

860
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,560
I've been looking for him.

861
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,480
But I couldn't find him.

862
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,200
I'm worried that Yan Shi Fan...

863
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,600
Yan Shi Fan?

864
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,600
It's okay.

865
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,320
Tell me.

866
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
What's going on?

867
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,880
When I was in Yangzhou,

868
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,600
Yan Shi Fan sent someone to arrest him.

869
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,080
I'll tell you the truth.

870
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm not sure.

871
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,840
I don't know.

872
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,640
I don't know.

873
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,360
I don't know.

874
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,080
I don't know.

875
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,880
I don't know.

876
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,640
Yan Shi Fan.

877
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,680
Your master and I

878
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,160
finally saved him.

879
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,080
I heard that something happened to Yang Yue.

880
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,760
So we came to Hangzhou to find you.

881
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,440
Why didn't you tell me about it?

882
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,680
Then...

883
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,720
Why did Yan Shi Fan arrest Dr. Lin?

884
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,720
Tell me.

885
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,480
I can't explain it in one word.

886
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,440
Anyway,

887
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Yan Shi Fan has a grudge against me.

888
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,840
His eyes

889
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,200
are hurt by Dr. Lin.

890
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,440
What?

891
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,960
If Dr. Lin is really caught by Yan Shi Fan,

892
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,840
he won't die.

893
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,600
I'm afraid it's half of his life.

894
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,640
Let's split up to find him.

895
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll go with Zeng Fu

896
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,800
to Yan Shi Fan to find out the situation.

897
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,440
Okay.

898
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,880
Uncle, let's go to the nearby place.

899
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,640
Okay.

900
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,320
Let's go.

901
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,920
You are Lin Ling?

902
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,120
Who are you?

903
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,080
We don't know each other.

904
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,320
Why did you send someone to arrest me?

905
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,680
I'm afraid you misunderstood.

906
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,160
I sent someone

907
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,720
to invite you here.

908
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,880
I think you didn't obey

909
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,880
and made my people act roughly.

910
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
Who are you?

911
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,000
It doesn't matter who I am.

912
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,600
You just need to know

913
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,320
that you are a good person.

914
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,720
I'm not a bad person.

915
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,920
I'm just a good person.

916
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm just a good person.

917
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,160
I'm just a good person.

918
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,800
Your good medical skills

919
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,080
are very important to me.

920
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,880
Is that okay?

921
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,480
If you want to find someone to treat you,

922
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,920
you've found the wrong person.

923
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,640
I won't treat people casually.

924
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,960
Dr. Lin, you misunderstood again.

925
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,280
When did I say

926
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,920
I want you to treat me?

927
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,240
I just want to make your doctor

928
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,200
who gave me the chief

929
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,640
happy.

930
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Chief?

931
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,640
Don't you know him?

932
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,040
In the southeast,

933
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,000
no one knows

934
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
Chief Mao, right?

935
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,000
Mao Haifeng?

936
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,400
Are you afraid?

937
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,360
I heard that Chief Mao

938
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,400
knew you were the successor of the Medicine King Valley

939
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,240
and wanted to keep you by his side

940
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
to serve him.

941
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,680
Take him with you.

942
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,320
Treat him well.

943
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,240
But don't let anything happen to him.

944
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,320
Let's go.

945
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,760
Let me go.

946
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,840
Let me go.

947
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,400
Let me go.

948
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Let me go.

949
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Let me go.

950
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Let me go.

951
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Let me go.

952
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,680
Sir,

953
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,160
Chief Lu wants to see you.

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Sir Yan,

956
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,240
Assistant спец Cheng,

957
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,480
at a good time,

958
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,240
and enjoyed

965
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,400
Yes

966
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,920
It seems that you are close to me recently.

967
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,320
What's the matter?

968
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,520
I heard that you and the divine doctor are old friends.

969
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,120
I wonder if you have invited Dr. Lin to come to your boat to save me.

970
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,520
Who?

971
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,720
Dr. Lin suddenly disappeared.

972
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,920
I thought Dr. Lin would come to visit you.

973
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,120
I hope he is on my boat.

974
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,920
If you don't believe me,

975
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,920
I allow you to visit my painting studio.

976
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,320
I am here to remind you.

977
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,120
Last night,

978
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,920
the food storage for General Yu was destroyed.

979
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,320
I found a hidden secret weapon in the storage.

980
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,520
The hidden weapon looks familiar.

981
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,720
I don't know what it has to do with me.

982
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,120
Since you don't know,

983
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,520
I will do it.

984
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,520
Young Master.

985
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,320
Go.

986
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,120
Call Zhan Lanyan here.

987
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,320
Yes.

988
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,920
And

989
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,320
find out who kidnapped Lin Ling.

990
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,320
I want to see who touched my woman.

991
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,520
Say it. Don't rush.

992
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,320
See what Master Lu will say when he comes back.

993
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,920
Master, how is it?

994
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,320
Is the divine doctor in his hand?

995
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,520
Master, do you believe Yan Shi Fan's words?

996
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
I can't believe it.

997
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,920
But his reaction is not like a hidden secret.

998
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,720
As far as I know,

999
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,920
if he kidnapped Lin Ling,

1000
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,920
he would tell us honestly.

1001
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,120
We would be begging him.

1002
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,120
But he didn't do that.

1003
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Who else?

1004
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,120
Say it.

1005
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,720
Is there any other enemy?

1006
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Ling has been in Fengling A'o for so many years.

1007
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
She won't offend anyone.

1008
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,520
Except Yan Shi Fan.

1009
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,520
There will be no other person.

1010
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,320
If she is not with Yan Shi Fan,

1011
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,520
the clue will be broken.

1012
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,520
Where should we find her?

1013
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,520
Master.

1014
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,920
Master Lu.

1015
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,920
You went to Yan Shi Fan to find out the secret.

1016
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,320
Did you tell him about Lin's disappearance?

1017
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
I did.

1018
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,520
But it's the first time

1019
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,520
I saw him control his emotions.

1020
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,520
Now that he knows it,

1021
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,520
we just need to keep an eye on Yan Shi Fan.

1022
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Then we can find her.
