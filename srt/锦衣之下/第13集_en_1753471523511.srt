You'll feel better after you get used to it.

100
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
Yang Putou is from Jiangxi.

101
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,160
Why did he live in Fujian for so many years?

102
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
I don't know.

103
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,640
Sir, please have a taste.

No, thanks.

I'll have some dishes.

106
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
You're so picky.

107
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
You must have been a good boy when you were a kid.

108
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,120
You were a good boy when you were a kid?

109
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Of course.

110
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,600
I'm not picky.

111
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,520
I'll eat whatever I want.

112
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
My mother said that she was going to choose someone in the pond.

113
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
A bunch of kids were eating there.

114
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
I was the worst eater.

115
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,440
She fell in love with me at first sight.

116
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,560
I hope I can save enough money

117
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,840
and find my biological parents soon.

118
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,920
You're an orphan.

119
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,840
I lost my family when I was a kid.

120
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
I lived in the pond for a while

121
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
and was adopted by my current mother.

122
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,000
Sir,

123
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720

I also know your intelligence.

You can talk about everything.

If you can help me,

131
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,960
maybe I can find my family.

132
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,480

133
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll help you find your biological parents.

134
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,520

I'll help you find your biological parents.

136

Today,

137
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
I invite you to eat this meal.

138
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
I also want to ask you for help.

139
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,520
Mother.

140
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Mother.

141
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,720
You really want to find your family?

142
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,320
I want to ask you for help.

143
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,120
After all,

144
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I've never seen my family since I was a kid.

145
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I don't know

146
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,320
if they're alive or dead.

147
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,520
Please help me.

148
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
If you help me,

149
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,120
I'll invite you to eat again next time.

150
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
You mean

151
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
if I help you,

152
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
I have to eat these vegetables for the second time, right?

153
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
These vegetables

154
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
are taken from the coffin of Guan Yi.

155
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520
It's not expensive, right?

156
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
How do you know?

157
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,320
But it doesn't matter.

158
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
I don't care how much money I'll pay for your meal.

159
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,320
What matters is my heart.

160
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,920
You must know it.

161
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,320
Since you didn't buy these ingredients,

162
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,920
if the dishes are made by Yang Yue,

163
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll pay for the wine.

164
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
I want to know

165
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
where your heart is.

166
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,120
No.

167
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
I washed all these dishes.

168
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
And this dish, this dish, and this soup.

169
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
I made them.

170
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
Yang Yue just came here

171
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
and gave me a hand.

172
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
Well,

173
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,120
I made this cake for you.

174
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
It's all my heart.

175
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,920
Sir,

176
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,120
I'll make a bigger one for you.

177
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
No need.

178
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,720
Don't put the ashes.

179
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
Okay. I know.

180
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Then I'll add some radish and tofu.

181
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
Tofu.

182
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,920
You've been eating this dish.

183
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,720
Sir, try it.

184
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,920
Sir,

185
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,720
you helped me a lot.

186
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
I'll give you a toast.

187
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,720
Wait.

188
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,320
Why do you want to drink at a girl's house?

189
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
You can't drink anymore.

190
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,720
Sir, you're afraid that I'll

191
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
drink in front of you, right?

192
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Don't worry.

193
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I've never drunk much since I was a child.

194
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
You've never drunk?

195
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
What's the relationship between you and Xie Xiao?

196
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,320
I was in a bad mood that time.

197
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
It was an accident.

198
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,920
Don't drink outside.

199
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,920
Yes, sir.

200
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Sir, have some dishes.

201
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Here.

202
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Have some more.

203
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,520
Thank you, sir.

204
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,920
What Dayang made is the best.

205
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Have some more.

206
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
You eat first.

207
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
I'll eat after you finish.

208
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
Have some of this.

209
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,720
Sir,

210
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
you've been working all day.

211
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,120
I'll make some fried pork and pork back.

212
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
No need.

213
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
Then I'll have some more.

214
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,520
Sir, I'll massage your head.

215
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,320
It's very comfortable.

216
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,320
No need.

217
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
My head is very comfortable now.

218
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,320
How about I make some water for you?

219
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,120
No need.

220
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,320
It's okay.

221
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,520
Sir.

222
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,320
No need.

223
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,320
Sir.

224
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,120
No need.

225
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm fine now.

226
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
Really no need.

227
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Sir, I'll make some tea for you.

228
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,320
No need.

229
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
Eat and then you can reduce your oil.

230
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
No need.

231
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
I'm telling you, no need.

232
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Sir.

233
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
No need.

234
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Then snacks?

235
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
No need for snacks.

236
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
No need for anything.

237
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
There's no possibility of everything being fine.

238
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,120
Sir.

239
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,720
No need.

240
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,920
Really no need.

241
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Dad.

242
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
Master.

243
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
You don't need to do this.

244
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Your leg is fine now.

245
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,320
It seems that Doctor Shen is really smart.

246
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
What do you want from me?

247
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,720
I heard that you made a table of vegetables.

248
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
And asked for Master Lu's help.

249
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,920
Yes.

250
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,120
Speaking of this,

251
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,520
I want to tell you something.

252
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,920
What is it?

253
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,120
It's about my family.

254
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
My biological parents.

255
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,720
What?

256
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
You have clues?

257
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
I don't have any clues.

258
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,920
But I mentioned this to Master Lu.

259
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
He didn't reject me directly.

260
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,120
I think that the Imperial Guards are well informed and have a lot of ears.

261
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,520
If he can really help me,

262
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,520
maybe I can really find my family.

263
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,120
Master, what's wrong?

264
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,520
Kneel down.

265
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,320
Dad.

266
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
If Master Lu is willing to help,

267
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
isn't it a good thing?

268
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,320
You kneel down too.

269
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,920
If you want to help,

270
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
it's better to kneel down.

271
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
Dad, I beg you.

272
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
In the future,

273
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,520
if you can help me,

274
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
it's better to kneel down.

275
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,720
Dad, I beg you.

276
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
I beg you.

277
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,120
I beg you.

278
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,920
I beg you.

279
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
Dad, you must help me.

280
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
You two.

281
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
You two.

282
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
You two are so stupid.

283
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,520
You two are so stupid.

284
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,920
For so many years,

285
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
I have spoiled you for nothing.

286
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
Who is Master Lu?

287
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,120
He is the Imperial Guard.

288
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,120
I will tell you three times.

289
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
You must be careful and cautious.

290
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,960
What is your identity?

291
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,880
What is your identity?

292
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,520
You are just a small

293
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,760
subordinate of Shilu Mountain Gate.

294
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,520
He found you doing things

295
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
and treated you well.

296
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,920
That is his skill.

297
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
To put it bluntly,

298
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,960
in his eyes,

299
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,520
you are no different from a dog.

300
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,800
But you

301
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,560
are a dog that you climb up

302
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,920
with no face, no skin, no chest, no chest.

303
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,400
Father, what you said is...

304
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,000
Shut up.

305
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Listen to me.

306
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,120
From now on,

307
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,520
you must keep your duty

308
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,080
when you talk and act.

309
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,920
If I find out

310
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,040
anything more,

311
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,640
I will break your legs.

312
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,680
Do you remember?

313
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,360
Master, why are you so fierce?

314
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
I don't think I did wrong.

315
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,880
I don't think I am so despicable

316
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,040
as you said.

317
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,200
I am afraid that you will suffer a loss.

318
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,880
The Imperial Guards are not ordinary people.

319
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,960
Master,

320
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,960
in your eyes,

321
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,840
am I really shameless?

322
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,760
I was right.

323
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,920
I was right.

324
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
I was right.

325
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,820
It is you

326
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
who really p despair.

327
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,640
No matter what happens,

328
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,440
you will be fine.

329
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
Get up, everyone.

330
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,440
Meanwhile,

331
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,320
you still owe Li Zhi şey

332
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,540
for your visits

333
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,120
I won't really play you

334
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,840
who's really Lily

335
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,220
Ron

336
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,240
you took Mr. Leeov

337
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,420
for an Handmaiden

338
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,520
He isī

339
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,320
I have my own plan for the marriage.

340
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,320
Leave now.

341
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,800
Let's go.

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
By the will of heaven,

343
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,960
the emperor has decreed that

344
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,400
the money for the marriage

345
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,960
has been returned.

346
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
The imperial guards can't see it.

347
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,840
I, Lu Yiwei,

348
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
the fourth-rank imperial censor,

349
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,960
hereby declare.

350
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

351
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,640
Long live Your Majesty.

352
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,800
Congratulations, imperial censor Lu.

353
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,600
Meizhuang.

354
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,640
Their captors are here.

355
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,720
So this easter egg has to be kept at home.

356
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,540
Do you think we can't give them a good present?

357
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,700
That in the end,

358
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,640
the ceremony was held by the regent himself.

359
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't understand.

360
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,600
Lord,

361
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,160
I previously presented Xiu Hua 어렵ly because

362
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,980
he really got upset at me.

363
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,560
But he wouldn't glamorous for this.

364
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,840
All right.

365
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,640
Yes.

366
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,640
Why didn't I hear

367
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,560
the voice of Officer Yuan this morning?

368
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,720
I saw him and Officer Yang

369
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
go to the Wu An Gang.

370
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,520
Well...

371
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
Is anyone here?

372
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
What happened to you?

373
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
Why is the gate closed

374
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,080
and so quiet?

375
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Who are you?

376
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm Yang Yue.

377
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
I'd like to

378
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,560
inform you about Young Master.

379
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,360
You want to see Young Master?

380
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,120
Yes.

381
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,600
You don't know that

382
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,880
the Dong's Water Village

383
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,040
took over the Yangzhou Wharf last night.

384
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,200
The brothers were angry

385
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,160
and fought with them.

386
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,760
Well,

387
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
Young Master and Young Master

388
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,960
took several Tang's

389
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,840
to Yangzhou Wharf this morning.

390
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,880
The Dong's Water Village

391
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,760
is so annoying.

392
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,280
Let's go to the wharf.

393
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,400
The Yangzhou Wharf

394
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,320
was under the control of the Wu An Gang.

395
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,160
Last night, the Dong's Water Village

396
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,960
sent people to take over the Yangzhou Wharf.

397
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,080
It caused all my goods

398
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,640
to stop on the shore.

399
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,880
Did you make this

400
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
to turn against the Wu An Gang?

401
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,680
Thank you for your words.

402
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,520
The Yangzhou Wharf

403
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,440
is not

404
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,280
your private wharf.

405
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,640
I, Dong Qisheng,

406
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,760
like the fat meat

407
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,560
in your hands.

408
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,920
I just want to

409
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
share a cup of soup.

410
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,480
How can you share a cup of soup?

411
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,880
A marriage?

412
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,760
If the Wu An Gang

413
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,640
and the Dong's Water Village

414
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,440
become relatives,

415
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,080
they will be strong partners.

416
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,160
Most of the

417
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,040
Yangzhou Wharf

418
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,160
is in our hands.

419
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,560
If you are happy,

420
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,040
we can expand the land

421
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,400
and bring all the

422
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,360
small and big

423
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,840
water supplies

424
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,880
to the village.

425
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,400
We can control the water supply

426
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,280
in a few days.

427
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,240
Bastard!

428
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,160
If your grandfather were alive,

429
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,360
he would be so happy

430
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,000
to hear your words.

431
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,760
Your grandfather and I

432
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,280
have been friends.

433
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,720
He is a kind person.

434
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,400
He knows the moral and national justice of the world.

435
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,960
He never breaks his promise.

436
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,160
Why can't you

437
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,120
see his shadow?

438
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,840
The moral and national justice of the world?

439
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,160
What a funny friend!

440
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,840
I didn't expect

441
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
you are so rich.

442
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,680
In this age,

443
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,320
milk is the mother.

444
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,520
If you don't

445
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,560
follow the law of the government,

446
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,120
what is the law?

447
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,400
Am I right,

448
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,640
little beauty?

449
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,960
You bastard!

450
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,360
How dare you

451
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,960
compare yourself with the Wu An Gang?

452
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,000
Go and ask around.

453
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
Who will say

454
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,160
you are bad people?

455
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,000
I am bad people?

456
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
I don't know who

457
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,800
made the bride angry

458
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,120
at the wedding day.

459
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,840
She sneaked away.

460
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,800
What a pity for that pretty girl.

461
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,120
Calm down.

462
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,160
Say it again.

463
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
Xie Xiao, don't be impulsive.

464
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,720
What?

465
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,920
You should use your power.

466
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,680
Come on.

467
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,040
Here comes Lord Wei.

468
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,400
Are you blind?

469
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
How dare you

470
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,880
make trouble in my place?

471
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,080
Do you have the law?

472
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,360
Lord Wei,

473
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,640
I am reasonable.

474
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,440
Tell me, what should I do?

475
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,400
I am also a man who obeys the court.

476
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,480
Lord Wei,

477
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
you should come to the review.

478
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
He did it first.

479
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,440
If you didn't talk nonsense,

480
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,480
I wouldn't beat you.

481
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,600
Look.

482
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,360
You are all

483
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
capable and brave people.

484
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,200
You are all

485
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,560
in the court.

486
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,400
You are so ungrateful.

487
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,920
If you keep being stubborn,

488
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,160
how can we manage the port?

489
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,320
I want you to

490
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,320
put an end to it.

491
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,640
Fine.

492
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,960
Since Lord Wei has said it,

493
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,280
how about this?

494
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,080
We are all from the martial arts world.

495
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,360
Let's have a competition.

496
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,280
The winner

497
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,640
will have the power to control the port.

498
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
What does Lord Dong Zhai mean?

499
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,400
He is the master of the chessboard.

500
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,720
He is a good judge.

501
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,520
What do you think, Lord Xie?

502
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Lord Wei,

503
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
please be fair.

504
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,440
Okay.

505
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I agree.

506
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,400
Father,

507
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,840
why did you agree?

508
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,000
The power to control the port

509
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,680
of Yangzhou is

510
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,560
of the Wu An Gang.

511
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,120
If they dare to make trouble again,

512
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,480
we will just fight them.

513
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,640
Why do we have to compete?

514
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,840
I want them to lose

515
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,240
with all their heart and mouth.

516
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,880
Xie Xiao, this is what you wanted,

517
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,920
right?

518
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,640
I am the standard of trust.

519
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,760
But I will never

520
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,120
play against this scumbag.

521
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,240
Master,

522
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,160
Dayang,

523
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,600
this competition

524
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,160
is not that simple.

525
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,640
That Dong Qisheng

526
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,660
must have prepared it.

527
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,320
Dong Qisheng

528
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
is so tight-lipped,

529
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
I wish I could go up there.

530
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Why?

531
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I'll kill him.

532
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Calm down.

533
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Keep an eye on Dong Qishao.

534
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Don't let him do anything bad before the competition.

535
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Okay. What about you?

536
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
I'll think of a way.

537
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Keep an eye on him.

538
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Xie Xiao!

539
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Senior Sister.

540
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
You know I'm your senior sister?

541
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
You're still so stubborn at your age.

542
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Old man must have his own reason for doing things.

543
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Don't think he's always wrong.

544
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Is it only Xie Xiao who's right?

545
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Brother Xie.

546
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
No matter what, Old Master Xie is your father.

547
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,040
No matter how angry he is, he has to face his brothers.

548
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
He can't get along with his old man.

549
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
My father is just a man of his word.

550
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm worried that he's been framed by that villain.

551
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,040
The government authority of Yangzhou is ours.

552
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
What right do they have to compete?

553
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Everyone knows Dong Qisheng's character.

554
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,040
If he gets the power, he won't be able to get along with him.

555
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Old Master knows what he's doing.

556
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
He won't just sit around and do nothing.

557
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
I think Miss Shangguan is right.

558
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Brother Xie, you should calm down.

559
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Besides, you've been in the martial arts world for three years.

560
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
You must have learned a lot.

561
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
I should have made this competition

562
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
to see your ability.

563
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Old Master Xie, please.

564
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Master Dong, what do you mean by this?

565
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
There are rules in the martial arts world.

566
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
No matter who wins or loses,

567
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
drinking this wine is like making a living.

568
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
The people in the martial arts world are all capable.

569
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
They don't care about each other's lives.

570
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
What kind of rules are these?

571
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,040
In the martial arts world, there are no rules.

572
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Plus, drinking wine is like hurting someone's life.

573
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
That's not good.

574
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Old Master Xie, you're wrong.

575
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Even if we're competing, how can we be afraid of no rules?

576
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
We're all from the martial arts world.

577
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Old Master Xie, you won't be twisted for this wine.

578
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
You'll make people laugh.

579
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
I'll drink to my heart's content.

580
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Please.

581
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Please.

582
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
What are you doing here?

583
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
What are you doing here?

584
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm thinking of how to tell you.

585
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
You just went out.

586
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
How did you know?

587
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Sir, you're here.

588
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
What do you want?

589
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Well...

590
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Well...

591
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Why are you laughing?

592
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
What do you want to say?

593
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Here's the thing.

594
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
The Dong Water Village is playing tricks.

595
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
They're forcing the Yangzhou Wharf to be their base.

596
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,040
The government agreed to use the Yangzhou Wharf as a place to settle the Yangzhou Wharf.

597
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,040
But the owner of the Dong Water Village is a sharp-tongued person.

598
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
He'll definitely use tricks in the competition.

599
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm thinking that you're a smart and powerful martial artist.

600
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
If you can show us a little skill,

601
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,040
the Dong Water Village will be in a bad spot in Cao Yun.

602
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,040
You came to me for this?

603
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Sir.

604
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Yuan Bu Kui seems to be very idle lately.

605
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
He's even trying to get others to be angry.

606
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
You're wrong.

607
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,040
This is not just a competition between two parties.

608
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Think about it. Dong Qi Sheng is cruel and vicious.

609
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
If they win the wharf,

610
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
they'll bully the people and the gangs.

611
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,040
They'll monopolize the Yangzhou Wharf and control the water.

612
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Think about it.

613
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
The pirates in the coastal areas are very strong.

614
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,040
If he colludes with the pirates,

615
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
the consequences will be unimaginable.

616
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
So, sir,

617
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
if you can use a little trick,

618
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,040
you can protect the people and make them happy.

619
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,040
It sounds like Yuan Bu Kui is really working hard for the people.

620
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Of course.

621
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
So, sir, please.

622
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
I won't go.

623
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Why?

624
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
I really admire Yuan Bu Kui's high-quality.

625
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,040
But I don't care about his idle business.

626
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Sir.

627
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Lu Yi, you're cruel.

628
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
What's going on?

629
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Why is it so quiet?

630
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Why is it so quiet?

631
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Why is it so quiet?

632
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Old Master Xie,

633
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,040
you don't look well.

634
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
What's going on?

635
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
What's going on?

636
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
What's going on?

637
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
I can't stand it anymore.

638
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Chief,

639
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
there's something wrong with your wine.

640
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Old Master Xie,

641
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
you can't talk nonsense.

642
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
We just drank the same bottle of wine.

643
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
If there's something wrong,

644
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
can my men and I still stand still?

645
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
I can't stand it anymore.

646
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,040
I can't stand it anymore.

647
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,040
I can't stand it anymore.

648
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I can't stand it anymore.

649
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
What's going on?

650
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Xiao Fei.

651
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Young Master.

652
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Xiao Fei, what's wrong?

653
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
My stomach hurts.

654
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Where's my father?

655
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
He's over there.

656
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
He looks like he's possessed by the power of the evil.

657
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Chief, you guessed it right.

658
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,040
That Dong Qisheng is playing tricks behind our back.

659
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
What's going on?

660
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Chief.

661
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Sit down.

662
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
I told you to watch him.

663
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
I didn't expect him to drug him.

664
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
What should we do?

665
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
The competition is about to start.

666
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
We can't go on the stage in their condition.

667
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,040
You two, let the contestants come out.

668
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
These scumbags are really coming.

669
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
I have to show them some respect.

670
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Senior Sister, let's go.

671
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
We can only do this in this situation.

672
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Let's go.

673
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
I hate you for being a villain.

674
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Da Yang, we have to leave this matter alone.

675
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
I have the same idea.

676
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Let's go.

677
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Let's go.

678
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
What?

679
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
The Wu'an Gang is no longer here?

680
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
They even sent a woman to the stage to get the book.

681
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
It's enough for us to deal with you four.

682
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
The one who deals with them will lose.

683
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Don't be too happy.

684
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,040
It's not certain who will win or lose.

685
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Enough.

686
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Today is the battle of the martial arts world.

687
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I am invited by Chief Xie and Chief Dong Zhai

688
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
to be the host.

689
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
The content of the competition is very simple.

690
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
You have seen it.

691
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Each side has a sense of flag.

692
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Which side will lead the team to take the flag back?

693
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,040
If you put the flag on the stage in front of you,

694
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,040
which side will be the steward?

695
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,040
During the competition, you must not hurt your life.

696
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,040
If someone steps out of the white line,

697
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
you will lose your qualification.

698
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
The competition begins.

699
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Okay.

700
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Move aside.

701
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Move aside.

702
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Sir, I have investigated it thoroughly.

703
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Dong Zhai has been bullying and bullying himself.

704
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
The man who is competing with Jin Xia

705
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
is the criminal that the court has been trying to catch.

706
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

707
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

708
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

709
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

710
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

711
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

712
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

713
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

714
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

715
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

716
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

717
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

718
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

719
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

720
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

721
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

722
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

723
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

724
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

725
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

726
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

727
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

728
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

729
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

730
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

731
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

732
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

733
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I have investigated it thoroughly.

734
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Ji Xia.

735
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Ji Xia, are you all right?

736
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,540
What happened?

737
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,040
I am fine.

738
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Miss Xiaohua, are you okay?

739
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
I'm fine.

740
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Your hand... you're hurt?

741
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
I'm fine.

742
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
You...

743
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Protect the flag.

744
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Go.

745
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Hey!

746
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Xie Xiao!

747
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Xie Xiao!

748
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
Stop!

749
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Lord Wei, you didn't say you could bring weapons to the battlefield.

750
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Chief Xie, your people are good at power.

751
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
My people are good at weapons.

752
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,040
They're good at fighting. What's wrong with that?

753
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
I think you're losing your eyes.

754
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
You're playing tricks.

755
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
You're making excuses.

756
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Lord Wei, I think we shouldn't continue with the competition.

757
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Lord Wei, we didn't say we couldn't bring weapons to the battlefield.

758
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,040
But I said we shouldn't hurt our lives.

759
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Guards!

760
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Yes!

761
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Drive him out!

762
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Yes!

763
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Let's go!

764
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Continue!

765
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Jinxia!

766
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Come on!

767
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Lord Wei, this... this is against the rules!

768
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
What's wrong with the rules?

769
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,040
According to the rules, five people will be killed in each side.

770
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
This is my fifth person.

771
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Good. Since it's your fifth person, why didn't you bring weapons in advance?

772
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,040
We didn't say we were going to start the competition.

773
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Master Dong, I said that as long as we don't hurt our lives,

774
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
we can do anything.

775
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Jinxia.

776
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Good!

777
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Good!

778
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Good!

779
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,040
The result of the competition is out.

780
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Wu Anbang wins!

781
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
Good!

782
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
The Yangzhou Wharf's Steward, Xuanwei...

783
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Lord Wei!

784
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I don't accept it!

785
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
A Wu Anbang like you

786
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,040
actually invited an outsider to be your steward?

787
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm not a steward.

788
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
I'm a general.

789
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I'm a general.

790
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I'm a general.

791
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I'm a general.

792
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm a general.

793
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I'm a general.

794
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
I'm a general.

795
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
I'm a general.

796
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,040
How could you ask an outsider to help you?

797
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
How can you think that they can win?

798
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Sir, they're here.

799
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,040
They're the Wu brothers who were wanted by the police.

800
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Outsiders?

801
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,040
When did you become the water debtor of the Dong family?

802
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
This...

803
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Since you all have an outsider, then let's just fight.

804
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
It's no use being a water debtor.

805
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I don't dare.

806
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
The water debtor of the Dock is the Wu Anbang!

807
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Thank you, sir!

808
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Good!

809
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Good!

810
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Good!

811
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Good!

812
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Good!

813
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Good!

814
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Good!

815
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Master Dong,

816
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,040
although the Yangzhou Wharf is not the Wu Anbang's,

817
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,120
the

818
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
I'm going to spare you today

819
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
for the sake of your grandfather.

820
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Otherwise, I would have killed you long ago.

821
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Xie Baili,

822
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
you're a man of your appearance,

823
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
but you promised to fight with us in public.

824
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
But you asked the Imperial Guards to help you.

825
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
You old fox!

826
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Don't fall into my hands.

827
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,040
I'll let you die in my hands.

828
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Let's go!

829
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Thank you.

830
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Thank you for your help.

831
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
The Wu Anbang can only be a danger.

832
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
I, Xie Mouren,

833
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
thank you for your kindness.

834
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Thank you, Master.

835
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
It's serious.

836
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
How is it serious?

837
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
If it weren't for you,

838
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
I really don't know if I would win this match.

839
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Thank you very much.

840
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
It's my duty.

841
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
It's my duty.

842
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Lu,

843
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
I've remembered what happened today.

844
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
You'd better remember it.

845
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Don't forget it.

846
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Sir,

847
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
I thought you wouldn't come.

848
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
So you're not that cold-hearted.

849
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Didn't Yuan Bukui risk his life

850
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
to protect the safety of the people?

851
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
But

852
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
my purpose in this trip is to capture the fugitives.

853
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Don't think too much.

854
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
I'm sorry.

855
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
I'm sorry.

856
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
I'm sorry.

857
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I won't do anything to them.

858
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Nonsense.

859
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
How can you predict it from a wobbly suits?

860
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Are you not afraid of me?

861
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
How can you think you're such a coward?

862
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
I'm familiar by such a theory

863
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
that I won't 닿 if it's necessary.

864
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Thank you.

865
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Things will get well late.

866
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
My boss never tells me

867
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
I must lie.

868
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
You should be increase it.

869
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
I'm going to find a spot to expose my fuss.

870
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
My boss

871
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
gave you a shock

872
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
when you were taken by the gosto.

873
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Not to mention

874
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
I'm not a dragon.

875
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
My face is so ugly.

876
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Am I not handsome and ugly?

877
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
You don't like me anymore?

878
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,040
The doctor said that I need to change the medicine for an hour.

879
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
These girls are so lazy.

880
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
It's been two hours.

881
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Why don't they give me medicine?

882
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
I'll go get one for you.

883
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,040
It's not that troublesome. You can give me medicine.

884
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,040
I'll give you medicine? Where?

885
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Here. Here. Here.

886
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
Everyone is injured.

887
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
Are you sure you want me to give you medicine?

888
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Come on.

889
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Your clothes are torn.

890
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Torn clothes?

891
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,040
You're injured. If you don't take off your clothes, how can I give you medicine?

892
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Yes. Yes. Yes.

893
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
It hurts.

894
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,040
It hurts so much when I take off my clothes.

895
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Why don't you help me?

896
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Come on.

897
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Okay. I'll take off your pants first.

898
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Why are you taking off your pants?

899
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
Are you injured on your legs? Come on. I'll take off your pants.

900
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
No. No.

901
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Why are you not ashamed?

902
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,040
I'm not that mature. How can I be a bad girl?

903
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Besides, I'll give you medicine. Why should I be ashamed?

904
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Lie down.

905
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Where? Who wants to get up?

906
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Which one?

907
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Are you sure you want me to give you medicine?

908
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Bear with it.

909
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
It's useful when it hurts.

910
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Bear with it.

911
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
Bear with it.

912
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
It hurts.

913
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Why don't I help you find a maid?

914
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
Bear with it.

915
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Stop laughing. The more you cry, the more you laugh.

916
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Bear with it.

917
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
Bear with it.

918
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
You've done a great job.

919
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Do you feel refreshed?

920
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,040
It's finally over. If you don't end it, I'll die here.

921
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Jinxia, thank you.

922
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,040
Why thank me?

923
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Thank you for wiping the medicine for me.

924
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,040
Jinxia, actually, I want to...

925
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,040
You take care of your injury and lie down and sleep.

926
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Have a good rest. I'm leaving. Don't move. Be good.

927
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
I haven't finished yet. Jinxia.

928
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Jinxia.

929
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Yuan Jinxia, I like you.

930
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
Are you crazy?

931
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,040
I've already made you like this. Do you still like me?

932
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Yuan Jinxia, I like you.

933
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Yuan Jinxia, do you hear me?

934
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,040
I, Xie Xiao, will definitely marry you.

935
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
You...

936
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Miss Shangguan, what's wrong?

937
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
Let's go.

938
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
Why don't you avoid me?

939
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
You're in a bad mood.

940
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,040
If you're willing to use me to vent your anger,

941
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
to vent your pain,

942
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I can't help but ask why you're avoiding me.

943
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Are you okay?

944
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
Oh.

945
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,040
This is the medicine I brought back from the capital.

946
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Apply it on your injured hand and you won't have scars anymore.

947
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
Here, for you.

948
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Thank you.

949
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Are you still busy?

950
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
I'm not busy.

951
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,040
I'm just worried that you're busy.

952
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,040
I'm sorry.

953
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,040
I'm sorry.

954
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,040
I'm sorry.

955
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
I'm sorry.

956
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
I'm sorry.

957
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
I'm sorry.

958
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
I'm sorry.

959
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
I'm sorry.

960
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
I'm sorry.

961
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,040
I'm sorry.

962
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
I'm sorry.

963
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
I'm sorry.

964
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
I'm sorry.

965
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm sorry.

966
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,040
Open your eyes and see the cold scenery.

967
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,040
The sword is full of arrows.

968
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,040
In the mortal world, who has conquered the world?

969
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,040
No sound, the sword rises and goes.

970
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Fate turns.

971
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Seeing through the changes in the world,

972
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I want to say goodbye.

973
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,040
But it's too sad to say goodbye.

974
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
I miss you.

975
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,040
I miss you so much.

976
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,040
I met you that day.

977
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,040
White hair in the old days.

978
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,040
We spent our childhood together.

979
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,040
In the dream, a word of farewell.

980
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
I miss you.

981
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
I miss you so much.

982
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
I miss you so much.

983
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
I miss you so much.

984
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
I miss you so much.

985
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,040
I miss you so much.

986
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,040
I miss you so much.

987
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,040
I miss you so much.

988
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,040
I miss you so much.

989
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,040
I miss you so much.

990
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,040
I miss you so much.

991
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
I miss you so much.

992
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,040
I miss you so much.

993
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,040
I miss you so much.
