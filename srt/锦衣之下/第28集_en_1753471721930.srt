00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeat is still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

The Long Ballad

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Fang Ling, what do you want?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do you have a soul mate?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you want?

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Tell me

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't touch me

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't touch me

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yan Shi Fan

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If anything happens to me

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I won't let you go

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you really stupid or are you pretending to be stupid?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I, Yan Shi Fan

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Am I afraid of you?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Besides

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This time

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are the one who stole the Net

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And you are the one who broke into my bed

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If someone is after you

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's also the people of your Medicine Valley

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Who are trying to assassinate the court officials

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But they have to be killed by three groups

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I give you advice

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Listen to me

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If I am happy

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Maybe I can let you go

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If I listen to you

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Will you let me go?

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will listen to you

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wait

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You, you let me go first

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's really boring to tie you

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Six inches

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Not big, not small, not fat, not thin

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This beauty

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is more beautiful

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Bastard

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Bastard

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,720
This way.

62
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Slap her!

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm going to kill you.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to avenge our Lin family.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Get him back!

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Have a good day!

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yan Fang, you must leave for Yangzhou immediately.

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Bring her back to me.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I want her alive.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't hurt her.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, Young Master.

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll leave immediately.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's great.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Lin Lang, you're so brave.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Lin Lang, I finally found you.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're mine.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This time, I'll lock you up by my side.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I won't let you leave again.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I won't let you leave again.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I won't let you leave again.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sir.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you doing?

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Are you a new maid?

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Didn't the steward tell you

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that no one is allowed to enter my room?

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I advise you to leave as soon as possible.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If my father knows,

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
he'll punish you for being a little short.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're a girl.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If he sells you,

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sir, what are you talking about?

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't understand.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is the medicine that Aunt Lin made for you.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Here, drink it while it's hot.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't need to drink medicine.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't drink it.

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sir, can I ask you a question?

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What question?

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you kneeling now?

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Thirteen.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thirteen?

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're thirteen in just a few hours.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you talking about?

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sir, you're thirteen.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Look at your hands.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Does it look like a thirteen-year-old's hand?

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're not in good health now.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Drink this medicine quickly.

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You'll be in good health.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Sir, what is this?

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My bracelet?

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why is it with you?

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Give it back to me.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Unless you drink the medicine.

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The bracelet is with me.

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Then I must be the person you trust, right?

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I won't hurt you or lie to you.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Drink the medicine.

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll give you the bracelet.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know you at all.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How do I know if you poisoned the medicine?

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You believe me now?

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Give it back to me.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Quickly.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This bracelet is for you.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I won't let you die.

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I won't let you die.

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I won't let you die.

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I won't let you die.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I won't let you die.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can go now.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll go now.

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So when you were 13 years old, you practiced swordsmanship so well.

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're really a good master.

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Miss Yuan.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Master.

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Master Lu, you recovered well.

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Master, you don't know.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Although you look normal now,

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
he's only 13 years old.

144
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Really?

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes.

146
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Master Lu.

147
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Master.

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Master Lu.

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Who are you?

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This...

151
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He doesn't even know me.

152
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is a green star pill I've been practicing.

153
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It can calm your mind and help you to get rid of your worries.

154
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you, master.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Master.

156
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why do I want to eat this?

157
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Master said eating this is good for your health.

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Eat it.

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you, master.

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Go practice sword with me.

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay.

162
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It seems that Lu Yi really lost his memory.

163
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If he can't remember it,

164
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I still have time to make the green star pill.

165
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I asked the school committee.

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They said that every entrance of the Imperial Guards is guarded by the Danqing Pavilion.

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So when the adults were attacked,

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
no suspicious person entered the Danqing Pavilion.

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So this assassin is very likely to be from the Danqing Pavilion.

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Out of the few of us,

171
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the most suspicious now

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is only Master Yuan Ming, Lan Qing Xuan and Sanshou.

173
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How dare you bully my grandson.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You don't take me seriously.

175
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How about this?

176
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You and Lan Qing Xuan are more familiar.

177
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
She will give you the investigation.

178
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Boy, you take care of Sanshou.

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Master Yuan Ming is a cunning man.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Ling Er, we will deal with him.

181
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Everyone, remember to be careful.

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Master, sorry to bother you.

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Dr. Lin, what's the matter?

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Nothing serious.

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's just that it's rare to live in Dan Pavilion.

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I want to take this opportunity to trouble you to help me solve the problem.

188
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I made a pot of tea.

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you are not busy,

190
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
please come to the test room for a while.

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

192
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Please.

193
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Slow down.

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Master, I have finished packing.

195
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
One is enough.

196
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let's hurry up.

198
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes.

199
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Speed up.

200
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hurry up.

201
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I know.

202
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hurry up.

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Be careful.

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Master, are you okay?

205
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How are you?

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Are you okay?

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Are you hurt anywhere?

208
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm fine.

209
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Let's go back.

210
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm fine.

211
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hurry up.

212
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm fine.

213
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's go.

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hurry up.

215
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm fine.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's go.

217
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Didn't you leave?

218
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why did you come back?

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hurry up.

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I...

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I feel very uneasy after I left.

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm afraid that you might have an accident.

223
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I came back to see you.

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Fortunately, I came in time.

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If I came later,

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the consequences would be...

227
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's go.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Did I tell you

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
not to appear in front of me again?

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I...

232
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't want you to be annoyed with me.

233
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But I can't let you go.

234
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
As long as I can't see you,

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I always miss you.

236
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You are in my mind.

237
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
When I think of the vow I made to you that night,

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I have to stay by your side.

239
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I said that I drank too much that night.

240
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I said all the drunk words.

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Dad.

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Did you forget that vow?

243
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That night,

244
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you just played a trick on me.

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You just said goodbye to the past.

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The vow you made

247
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
was just a word to comfort me.

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You don't have to take it seriously.

249
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm not worthy of you.

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Wasting your time and protecting me.

251
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Why do you treat yourself so lightly?

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Is it worth it to protect the one who raised you?

253
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I didn't do it for anyone.

254
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I did it for myself.

255
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Even if I live alone,

256
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I will protect the Wu An Gang forever.

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Did you do this for Xie Xiao?

258
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But she doesn't like you.

259
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Miss Shangguan.

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Can you turn around and look at me?

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Look at me.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I will be nice to you more.

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Take care of you.

264
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Take care of me?

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,200
You are just a small piece of

266
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,000
a small piece of

267
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
a small piece of

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why should you take care of me?

269
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you want to know how Xie Xiao is doing?

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
She is just fine.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You don't deserve to

272
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
read her name.

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't wait for me.

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't deserve you to treat me like this.

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't deserve you to treat me like this.

276
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
When you find your own husband,

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I will personally go to the water's surface

278
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and help you get your feet out.

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What if I don't marry for the rest of my life?

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No.

281
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You are such a good girl.

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There must be someone

283
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
who is very, very good to you.

284
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I know you are very affectionate to this woman.

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But her heart is more reliable than a stone.

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Wait.

287
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Look.

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Now it's working.

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Can you

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
not stare at me so straight?

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay.

292
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Idiot.

293
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yang Yue.

294
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Are you the King of the Fruits?

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You won't leave me?

297
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I will never leave you.

298
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I know why you pushed me away.

299
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because you can't let go.

300
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Because you can't let go.

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You can't let go of the stars.

302
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You smile really beautifully.

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why don't you smile more than usual?

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm in charge of the small things in the gang.

305
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I deal with people in every way.

306
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's not because of my smile

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
that I can shock them.

308
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why are you so harsh to yourself?

309
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Do you think I don't want to get angry and get angry?

310
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I can say whatever I want.

311
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't care about others' feelings at all.

312
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I want to do the same.

313
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I can't do it.

314
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Only those who grow up in family's favor

315
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
can have this confidence.

316
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And I

317
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
will never be able to do it.

318
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You are a woman.

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If you are tired,

320
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
you can find a shoulder to lean on.

321
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Lean on?

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Who can let me lean on?

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Xie Xiao is still not married.

324
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can't help you get married.

325
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't worry.

326
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I won't bring you any more trouble.

327
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
As long as I can protect you silently.

328
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Lan.

329
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why don't you go out these days

330
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and lock yourself in the room?

331
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Are these the scriptures that I used to copy?

332
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes.

333
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I thought of the little Xiao Xin.

334
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Before enjoying life,

335
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
she was killed by someone.

336
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
She died with someone.

337
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
In my heart,

338
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I feel so bad.

339
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Except Xiao Xin,

340
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
do you have no other disciples?

341
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When Dan Qingge was in high position,

342
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
many disciples sent their children

343
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to practice.

344
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
They wanted to stabilize their mind.

345
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
At that time,

346
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
other masters in the prison

347
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
were widely accepted.

348
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But I never met

349
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
a child who was born in the first place.

350
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Then,

351
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I saw Xiao Xin

352
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and her parents die separately.

353
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Father.

354
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Mother.

355
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Father.

356
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Mother.

357
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Xiao Xin.

358
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Xiao Xin.

359
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's okay.

360
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I understand

362
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
the feeling of being in heaven and earth.

363
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So I want to take her as my disciple.

364
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I want to give her a home.

365
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I just didn't expect

366
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
our fate to be so close.

367
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Then,

368
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
have you ever thought of

369
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
having another disciple?

370
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No.

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's hard enough

372
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
to lose a disciple.

373
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't want to come here again.

374
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What's wrong?

375
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Why are you here?

376
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I want to ask you

377
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
something.

378
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's okay.

379
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I just want to see you.

380
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You can go out and walk.

381
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I won't bother you.

382
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So,

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I feel even more guilty

384
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
after hearing her words.

385
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I actually suspect my friend.

386
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's not your fault.

387
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Xiao Xin is a legend.

388
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There's nothing suspicious

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
about Master Yuan Ming and Sanshou.

390
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What clues did they reveal?

391
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hey.

392
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What are you doing here with them?

393
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Who are they?

394
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Why are you here?

395
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
They are my friends.

396
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Friends?

397
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Ling Ling.

398
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is your medicine good?

399
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Why is it not cured yet?

400
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I can't.

401
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Then, you should think of a way.

402
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I...

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll think of a way.

404
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't call me.

405
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Xie Yuan Yuan, what are you doing?

406
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm treating a patient.

407
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Hey, are you sick?

408
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You're the one who's sick.

409
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What are you doing?

410
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Xie Xiao...

411
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
In a while,

412
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
you'll be fine.

413
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You're so annoying.

414
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Whose voice is this?

415
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Why is it so miserable?

416
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Xie Xiao, let me tell you.

417
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If you hurt my grandson,

418
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I won't let you off.

419
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Sister.

420
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What did you call me?

421
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Sister.

422
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Sister?

423
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sister?

424
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Can I ask you a question?

425
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
How old are you?

426
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Sister, I'm eight years old.

427
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Eight?

428
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Ling Ling, look at your medicine.

429
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
She's eight years old from thirteen years old.

430
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
If you don't ask me,

431
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
why are you asking me?

432
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes, I'm asking you.

433
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Xie Xiao!

434
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm going to beat you to death today.

435
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Don't be so rude.

436
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I...

437
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You're giving me ideas.

438
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm not.

439
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm going to beat you to death.

440
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Stop it!

441
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sister,

442
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
why are they so fierce?

443
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
They're playing.

444
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Don't be afraid.

445
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You...

446
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm afraid.

447
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You're not afraid?

448
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll take you to eat something.

449
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Okay.

450
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Let's go.

451
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:17,680
Witchgroom Mansion

452
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Sister, it's me.

453
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You didn't sleep at night.

454
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
Why did you come here?

455
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm scared.

456
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
What are you scared of?

457
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
There are thunders outside.

458
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm scared.

459
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm scared.

460
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm scared.

461
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm scared.

462
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm scared.

463
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm scared.

464
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
There are thunders outside.

465
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You're scared of thunders?

466
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm not scared.

467
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Let me tell you.

468
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Thunder is a fart that Thunder Lord made.

469
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You can't let him hold it in, can you?

470
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Thunder is a fart that Thunder Lord made?

471
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes.

472
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But my mother didn't tell me that.

473
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You believe me.

474
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Let's go.

475
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll take you back to sleep.

476
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Sister.

477
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm not leaving.

478
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I want to sleep with you.

479
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
When it was raining,

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
my mother slept with me.

481
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Sleep together?

482
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That's not good.

483
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Then you take me to my mother.

484
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I miss her.

485
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Your mother...

486
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Your mother is in a faraway place.

487
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Listen to me.

488
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Sleep well.

489
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'll take you to her, okay?

490
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You're the best.

491
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Sister.

492
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Don't leave me alone.

493
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm scared.

494
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Okay.

495
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I...

496
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Be good.

497
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Don't be afraid.

498
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm here.

499
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Don't be afraid.

500
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm here.

501
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Sister.

502
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What are you doing?

503
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I think you were so cute when you were little.

504
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Cute when I was little?

505
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You're cute when you grow up.

506
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Sister.

508
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What are you doing?

509
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm hungry.

510
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Hungry?

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What do you want to eat?

512
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What do you think?

513
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yuan Jin Xia.

514
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
What are you thinking about?

515
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
He's just an eight-year-old child.

516
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You're really...

517
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
I...

518
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's just hearing from him.

519
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yes.

520
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Colonel Yuan.

521
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,840
Yuan Daxia.

522
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,920
Yuan Daxia.

523
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,600
Jinxia.

524
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Jinxia.

525
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Yuan Daxia.

526
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,320
Jinxia.

527
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,520
What's wrong, Xie Yuanyuan?

528
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,720
You're so early in the morning.

529
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,880
Can you let me sleep?

530
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,120
I got up early

531
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,960
to buy your favorite

532
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,560
scallion oil cake for you.

533
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,720
Open the door.

534
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,640
I don't want it.

535
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,080
Enough.

536
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,640
You don't want it?

537
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,960
Fine. It's delicious.

538
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:35,920
How can you

539
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,120
sneak into a girl's room?

540
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,920
I'm just worried.

541
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,240
I want you to eat something hot.

542
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,280
Stop writing.

543
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't want it.

544
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,680
Hurry up.

545
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,400
Put down the pen.

546
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,240
Go.

547
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,120
Hurry up. Go out.

548
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,120
Hurry up.

549
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,680
Hurry up.

550
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,600
Why is it so noisy?

551
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,680
Sister.

552
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,360
Why are you awake?

553
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,480
No.

554
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,400
She and I...

555
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Don't sleep here.

556
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,840
No.

557
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,840
No.

558
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,520
No.

559
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,160
No.

560
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,960
It's not like that.

561
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,320
No.

562
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,560
Sister.

563
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,560
You snored last night.

564
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,440
Do you know?

565
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,920
Nonsense.

566
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,400
I never snore when I sleep.

567
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,080
I didn't.

568
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,600
You snored

569
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,600
and brushed your teeth.

570
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,880
Brushed my teeth?

571
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,400
Yes.

572
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,600
You even said in your dream.

573
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,800
In your dream, you said

574
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,680
you wanted to eat me.

575
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,560
No.

576
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,400
It's the same.

577
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,840
It's the same.

578
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,680
It's the same.

579
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,080
I didn't sleep with you.

580
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,400
You're Lu.

581
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,920
Stop yelling.

582
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,000
I didn't sleep with you.

583
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,560
Let go of me.

584
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,120
Stop yelling.

585
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,760
I'll kill you.

586
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,600
I don't know.

587
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,400
Let go of me.

588
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,120
Tong Yuan.

589
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,520
I told you I was Lu.

590
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,360
I didn't sleep with you.

591
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,320
What's going on?

592
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,080
I'm Lu.

593
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,000
I didn't sleep with you.

594
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
Why are you so cruel?

595
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,000
Get out.

596
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,560
I'm telling you.

597
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,080
I'm Lu.

598
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,120
Come out.

599
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,280
I didn't sleep with you.

600
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Stop talking nonsense.

601
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,120
I'm Lu.

602
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,480
What?

603
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,560
What are you staring at?

604
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,280
I told you.

605
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,720
Yesterday he was struck by lightning.

606
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,640
He was afraid to sleep alone.

607
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,160
So Lu Dan and I are in a bad mood.

608
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,920
I swear.

609
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,400
Jin Xia, tell me.

610
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,640
Did he hurt you last night?

611
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,120
I didn't.

612
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,880
I didn't.

613
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,800
I didn't.

614
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,440
I swear.

615
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,080
I didn't.

616
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,760
I didn't.

617
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,480
I didn't.

618
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,280
I didn't.

619
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,920
I didn't.

620
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,720
I didn't.

621
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,520
I didn't.

622
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,200
I didn't.

623
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,960
I didn't.

624
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,680
I didn't.

625
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,640
I didn't.

626
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,520
How could it be?

627
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,680
He's a child of eight years old.

628
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,480
What's wrong with eight years old?

629
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,680
He's grown up.

630
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,320
Who knows if he's pretending to be stupid

631
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,880
and deliberately came to you to eat your tofu?

632
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
How could it be?

633
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,240
Look.

634
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,240
Look.

635
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,520
See?

636
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,320
He's eating your tofu.

637
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
See?

638
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,240
Get up.

639
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,080
Eat tofu.

640
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Eat tofu.

641
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
I'll beat you to death.

642
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,760
Xie Xiao.

643
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,480
How dare you bully my master?

644
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,520
Enough.

645
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,120
Stop it.

646
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,680
Why are you arguing with your own people?

647
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Who's arguing with his own people?

648
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,000
Who's arguing with your own people?

649
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,920
Master's mind is broken.

650
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,880
What about you?

651
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,080
How many years have you been in the position?

652
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,920
Let me introduce.

653
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,440
This is my master,

654
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,320
Master Ling Ming.

655
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,840
I'm fine.

656
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
I've been having trouble lately.

657
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Master.

658
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,720
Is the body flat and disappear?

659
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,240
Lu Tianyu.

660
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,240
I still have a child.

661
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Give the emperor the pill.

662
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,240
I just want to give you a good idea.

663
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,600
You two are not even as good as an eight-year-old child.

664
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,520
Don't guess my master's mind.

665
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,240
I'm close to Master Lu.

666
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
I have nothing.

667
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,680
Why do you men have

668
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,480
such an unprofessional thing in your mind?

669
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,040
I don't have it now.

670
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,800
The most important thing

671
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,840
is to let Master recover quickly.

672
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,400
If we continue like this,

673
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,280
what if tomorrow morning

674
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,000
we become a treasured baby

675
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,080
and don't even know how to talk?

676
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
What should we do?

677
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,000
Where's Master?

678
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,080
Master.

679
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
Hurry up. Let's split up.

680
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,440
Master.

681
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,320
Will he really become a treasured baby?

682
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,200
Lu Yi.

683
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,240
Lu Yi.

684
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,680
Lu Yi.

685
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,560
Lu Yi.

686
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,680
Lu...

687
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,320
Lu Yi.

688
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,600
Master Lri.

689
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,960
General Long.

690
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,720
Master Lu.

691
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,600
Marshal Lu.

692
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Why are you here?

693
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
What kind of person is this?

694
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Are you looking for me?

695
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Lord Lu, let's go out.

696
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
No, I want to play with these things.

697
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
They are colorful.

698
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
It's more fun outside.

699
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Come, come, come.

700
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
I like these stones too.

701
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840
There really is something fun. Come.

702
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,840
These are colorful. I can draw.

703
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Come, come, come.

704
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm not going out.

705
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Come, come, come.

706
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Why should I listen to you? Who are you?

707
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Come out.

708
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Let go of me.

709
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Let go of me.

710
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Stop it, okay?

711
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Lord.

712
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Lord.

713
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Let me in.

714
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Sister.

715
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
This person bullied me.

716
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Why are you here?

717
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Master, you are distracted again.

718
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Please forgive me.

719
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,840
It's okay. It's just that the state of the master is getting worse.

720
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Miss Yuan,

721
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
please take care of the master.

722
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Don't let him run around.

723
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Thank you for your reminder. I will.

724
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
How can you run around? I'm so worried about you.

725
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Come, come, come.

726
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
There's something fun in there.

727
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Go back and play.

728
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
What fun? Go back. I'll get it for you.

729
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
It's really fun.

730
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Come, come, come.

731
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Go back and play.

732
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Go back.

733
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Go back.

734
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
There's still one last step.

735
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
My Bu Lao Shen Pill is going to be successful.

736
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
At this time,

737
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
no one can

738
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
destroy my plan.

739
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

740
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Let me see.

741
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
Fortunately, I'm not hurt.

742
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Otherwise, the layer should have been cut off.

743
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
I told you to run around.

744
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Run around?

745
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
What are you looking at?

746
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
Are you still running around?

747
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Are you still worried about others?

748
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
You have to be obedient.

749
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
What are you looking at?

750
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Is what I said wrong?

751
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840
It seems that Yuan Bu Kui

752
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840
has been very fond of the subordinate.

753
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
He...

754
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Is...

755
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
Are you Master Lu?

756
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
What?

757
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Do you need me to prove it to you?

758
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
You're fine.

759
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
When did you recover?

760
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Before Master Quyue Ming

761
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
came into my room, I had already recovered.

762
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
It seems that Yuan Bu Kui

763
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
likes to take advantage of me when I'm sick.

764
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
No, no, no. I don't dare.

765
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
I'm just worried about your safety.

766
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
It's just that

767
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
you're pretending to be too good.

768
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
That's great.

769
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Master, you're great.

770
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,840
I'll go tell Ling Yi and the others.

771
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Wait.

772
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
Don't tell anyone about this.

773
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Why?

774
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
There's no such thing as why.

775
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
Okay.

776
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Another face of a wild cat.

777
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,840
It's still cute when I was young.

778
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
What are you talking about?

779
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,840
I said that you were very cute when you were young.

780
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
But, Master,

781
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,840
do you remember who poisoned you?

782
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
I heard the sound of a ship's whistle.

783
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,840
My heart is in a state of shock.

784
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Thousands of miles

785
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,840
of ambush are coming.

786
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Who is out of the city?

787
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,840
Can't compare to

788
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,840
fate.

789
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
Close your eyes.

790
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
I can see your face.

791
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Open your eyes.

792
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,840
The north is quiet.

793
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
The sword is full of heaven.

794
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Who has conquered

795
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,840
the world?

796
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
No sound.

797
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,840
The sound of the flute is silent.

798
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Fate is unpredictable.

799
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Seeing through the changes in the world.

800
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Like parting.

801
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Parting is too sad.

802
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Parting is too sad.

803
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
The golden leaf

804
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,840
of the yearning

805
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
met

806
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
your white hair

807
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,840
on that day.

808
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
We spent our years together.

809
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
In the dream,

810
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,840
a word of love

811
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,840
is in my heart.

812
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
The love of my life

813
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,840
is in your heart.

814
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
The love of my life

815
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
is in your heart.

816
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,840
The love of my life

817
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
is in your heart.

818
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
The love of my life

819
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
is in your heart.

820
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,840
The love of my life

821
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,840
is in your heart.

822
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,840
The love of my life

823
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
is in your heart.

824
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,840
The love of my life

825
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
is in your heart.
