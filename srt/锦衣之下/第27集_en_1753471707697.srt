00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You are thinking half way

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Impossible

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What happened?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Master, master

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They said

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is a small matter

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They said this is a small matter

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Small matter

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They said this is a small matter

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hurry up

The murderer is so cruel

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Master

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He is just a child

36

Master

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are drunk

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I have never been so happy

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have never been so happy

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How can I be drunk

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How can I be drunk

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't believe

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't believe

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Look at your face

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000

Aren't you

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you deep in love with me

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Am I right

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You won't leave

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,080
Please, old man

70
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,440
I will never leave you

71
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,760
If there is any violation

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,520
I will be beaten to death

73
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,760
Yang Yue

74
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,720
You are so cute

75
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,040
Really

76
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,480
Why are you down

77
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,960
I just said you were drunk

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,440
Get up

79
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
It's cold on the ground

80
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Get up

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
I fell to death

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,960

I'm sorry

141
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
I...

142
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,940
You're awake.

143
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,940
I returned to the capital to ask His Highness to change his identity.

144
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,940
I officially propose to you.

145
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
No need.

146
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,540
No matter what we said last night,

147
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,940
let's forget about it.

148
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Impossible.

149
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,540
How can we forget?

150
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,540
Do you think I'm a casual person?

151
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Yang Yue, I don't want to hurt you.

152
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,140
How can this be hurt? I can't do it.

153
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,540
Will you marry someone who doesn't love you?

154
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I do. I've made my vow.

155
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,140
I must be with you.

156
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,540
But I don't want to marry someone I don't like.

157
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,140
Last night, we drank too much.

158
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,140
We were drunk.

159
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,540
But I'm drunk.

160
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,540
But I'm still sober.

161
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,540
Trust me.

162
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,540
I'm not a person who is blind.

163
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Since I've made my vow,

164
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
I'll be responsible for it.

165
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
You won't leave me?

166
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,540
I'll never leave you.

167
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
You swear?

168
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
I swear.

169
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Yang Yue, no matter what we said last night,

170
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
I don't need you to follow my vow.

171
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Do you hear me?

172
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,540
I hear you.

173
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,540
You don't need me to be responsible.

174
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,540
But I can't do that.

175
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,540
You're a woman.

176
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
I'm not a woman.

177
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,540
I don't care about these promises.

178
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
You're a man. Why are you so stubborn?

179
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Let go.

180
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
I won't.

181
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I don't care if you really like me.

182
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,540
I've made my vow.

183
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,540
I won't leave you.

184
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,540
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,540
I really don't want to leave you.

187
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,540
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
I really don't want to leave you.

190
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Maybe we will find the way said words on the clapping pose.

191
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,240
Furthermore,

192
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,260
aluminium sh宝 wa is gilded by cathode.

193
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,940
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,900
I promise you that I'll find the murderer.

195
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,540
I'll be your

196
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,220
first-rate traitor.

197
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,980
If this matter is exposed to the world,

198
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,300
I'll never be a human again.

199
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,340
Xiao Lan, have mercy.

200
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,580
If Xiao Xin sees you like this,

201
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,420
she'll be very sad.

202
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,180
Maybe she's reuniting with her parents.

203
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,140
You can go back first.

204
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,540
I want to be alone with Xiao Xin for a while.

205
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,540
You can tell me the story outside.

206
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,540
Well,

207
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,340
there are six West Lake in the world.

208
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,540
But

209
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,940
there's only the West Lake in Yangzhou.

210
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,340
It's the most beautiful.

211
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,740
That guy.

212
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,340
When it comes to the Spring Festival,

213
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,540
the boat on the lake

214
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
is the most beautiful.

215
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
That's why I'm here.

216
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
I'm here to help you.

217
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,540
I'm here to help you.

218
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,740
The boat on the lake

219
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,140
is one by one.

220
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,740
One by one.

221
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,140
One by one.

222
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,740
One by one.

223
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Is there anything better than chicken legs?

224
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,940
Of course.

225
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,340
Have you ever eaten

226
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,340
the sweet and sour gourd?

227
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,740
Have you ever eaten the soft and delicious cloud cake?

228
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,940
No.

229
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
It's okay if you haven't eaten it.

230
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,540
When you have a chance to go out,

231
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,140
I'll treat you to it.

232
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,340
Okay.

233
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,340
When I become the leader,

234
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,740
I can go out.

235
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
By then,

236
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,740
I can make you the big wizard of Dragon-egg Village.

237
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,140
Then you can cook for me every day.

238
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,540
Well,

239
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,340
except eating,

240
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,140
you don't have any other wishes.

241
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,940
My father said that my mission

242
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
is to guard the long life knife of the ancestral hall,

243
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,540
so that it will never die.

244
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,940
And to guard the dragon in the well.

245
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,140
This is my wish.

246
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,340
Good boy.

247
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,140
What a big wish.

248
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,940
Don't worry.

249
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,740
Your wish will come true.

250
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,540
Will you stay in Dragon-egg Village forever?

251
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,740
It's delicious.

252
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,140
It's late.

253
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,940
Since you've treated me to chicken legs,

254
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,540
you are my good friend now.

255
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,540
If you are bullied in Dragon-egg Village,

256
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,140
you can call me by my name.

257
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,540
I'll take care of you from now on.

258
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,340
Does it help to call me by your name?

259
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,140
Forget it.

260
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,940
I'm glad that you have this wish.

261
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,140
Okay.

262
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,940
It's a deal.

263
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
From now on,

264
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
you can take care of me in Dragon-egg Village.

265
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,340
Okay.

266
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,340
Be careful.

267
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,740
I haven't brought you sugar-coated sweet potatoes.

268
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,740
I haven't bought you a piece of cake.

269
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,940
Don't worry.

270
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,940
I'll light up the long life knife of Dragon-egg Village

271
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,540
again for you.

272
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,940
Go.

273
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Sir Lu.

274
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,540
Master, where are you going?

275
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Since you are here,

276
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
please come in.

277
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,540
Please sit down, Sir Lu.

278
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,340
I'll make tea now.

279
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,140
I saw Master Er Bao lying on the ground.

280
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,540
No one has ever been hurt.

281
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,540
There must be something wrong with Yuan Ming.

282
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,140
Speaking of which,

283
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,340
I, the disciple of Lan,

284
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,740
was in a bad mood.

285
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
I was in a low mood.

286
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Thanks to Master Lu's guidance.

287
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,140
Master,

288
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,740
I should do these things.

289
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,140
But under the supervision of the Imperial Guards,

290
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,740
the murderer was able to get away with it.

291
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,140
It's also suspicious.

292
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Master, can you tell me

293
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,940
where you were when the crime happened?

294
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,540
I was in a bad mood that day.

295
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,340
I stayed in the room and didn't leave.

296
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
In that case,

297
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,340
I won't bother you today.

298
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
Okay.

299
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,540
Sir Lu, take care.

300
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
Xiao Lan.

301
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,540
Xiao Lan.

302
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,140
Go and ask Master Lu

303
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,540
to tell him that I have something important to discuss with him.

304
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Okay.

305
00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:19,140
Mr. Lu,

306
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,780
Come, this way please

307
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,340
Come

308
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,260
Get up

309
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,220
thank you

310
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,620
stamp

311
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,100
The lord Lu has calling

312
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,700
Luo

313
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,580
You leave while in my room

314
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,940
What did you mean

315
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,540
Master, you are being a thief.

316
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,940
Then,

317
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,340
I have something to say.

318
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,340
It's none of your business if you die.

319
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,740
When he was in trouble,

320
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,940
Lan Qing Xuan and I were playing chess.

321
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,740
Sanshou was in bed.

322
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,540
You have the chance, right?

323
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,740
You said so.

324
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,340
Do you have any evidence?

325
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
I do.

326
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,140
No evidence.

327
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,740
I didn't see it with my own eyes.

328
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,340
But I don't understand

329
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,740
why you killed Xiao Xin.

330
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,940
Because she shouldn't have seen it.

331
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,940
Does Er Pang's death

332
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
have something to do with you?

333
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
So,

334
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,140
you are just guessing.

335
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
If what I said before was just a guess,

336
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,740
then Master invited me here

337
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,940
to make a guess.

338
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,340
Lord Lu, you are the Imperial Guard.

339
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,540
You came to Dan Qing Pavilion for a purpose.

340
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,340
I know it clearly.

341
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Since Master knows it clearly,

342
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,340
why are you so bold

343
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,340
to take the risk?

344
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,340
Bold?

345
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,940
Dare to take the risk?

346
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,540
Take the risk?

347
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,140
This is my territory.

348
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,940
Master,

349
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,140
you are too confident.

350
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,540
I am...

351
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,740
If you are not so confident,

352
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,740
how can you invite Master

353
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,340
to come to the room?

354
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,940
Since Master is so honest,

355
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,740
I won't hide anything.

356
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,540
Tell me.

357
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,340
Why did you poison the emperor's elixir

358
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,940
in the palace?

359
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,340
Poison?

360
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,140
Forget about the other things.

361
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,140
Poisoning the emperor's elixir

362
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,540
is what I have been training with my whole life.

363
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,140
Why should I

364
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,940
poison the emperor's elixir?

365
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,540
I have trained with my blood.

366
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,540
Why should I find my own way?

367
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,540
If you have got the evidence of my poisoning,

368
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,940
you would have taken my head

369
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,340
to the capital to meet the emperor.

370
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,540
Why bother to take me back

371
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,140
to the capital for trial?

372
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,940
Master is a wise man.

373
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,540
Indeed,

374
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,740
I have no evidence to prove that you poisoned the emperor's elixir.

375
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
So,

376
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,140
Lord,

377
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,340
why not be a good man

378
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,740
and wait for me to finish the elixir training?

379
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,340
Then you can go to the capital.

380
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,940
What's the point

381
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,140
of doing such a simple thing?

382
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,540
You want me to do nothing?

383
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
I just want to

384
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,140
give you a clear way.

385
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,540
Master is a wise man.

386
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,740
Your inner light

387
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,140
You are indeed a genius.

388
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,140
This colorless and tasteless incense

389
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,740
is only working now.

390
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,940
The elixir is almost ready. I don't want to harm you.

391
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,740
May I trouble you to stay in Dan Qing Pavilion and fight for the six realms?

392
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,640
Lord!

393
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,240
Lord!

394
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,140
Stop!

395
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,540
Lord!

396
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,740
Lord!

397
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,340
Somebody! Please help!

398
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,940
What happened, Lord?

399
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Go. There's someone at the back. Hurry up and Ik, Je.

400
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Sir.

401
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,300
Sir.

402
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,900
What's wrong?

403
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,300
He lies here as soon as I come in.

404
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Why is he lying on the ground?

405
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,900
His face is so hot. What should we do?

406
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,740
It's not a big problem.

407
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,180
He must have fainted.

408
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,980
Let's put him on the bed first.

409
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,540
Okay.

410
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,580
Sir.

411
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,940
I wonder if you found

412
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
any important clues

413
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,220
that led to the murder.

414
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,180
What murder?

415
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,980
I think it's a trap.

416
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,820
Don't talk nonsense.

417
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,020
How is it? Did you catch him?

418
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,300
I think you'd better

419
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,580
keep someone here

420
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,540
before he wakes up.

421
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,660
In case the assassin will come back.

422
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,860
I'll keep an eye on him.

423
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,860
Let me do it.

424
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,820
Please keep the subordinates outside

425
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
in case the assassin comes back.

426
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,180
How can I do that?

427
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,140
You're alone in a room.

428
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
What if someone comes out?

429
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,340
I'm not afraid of you.

430
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,020
The enemy is our people.

431
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,260
You don't want to catch the murderer.

432
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,220
Why do you care about the business of alone?

433
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,740
That's not good.

434
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,860
Enough, Xie Xiao.

435
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,460
We men are all rough.

436
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,620
We can't take good care of him.

437
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,340
Let Jin Xia take care of him here.

438
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,380
I'm very careful.

439
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,140
It's settled.

440
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,380
Jin Xia will take care of you inside.

441
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,580
I'll guard the door.

442
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,340
Jin Xia.

443
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,140
I'm leaving.

444
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,300
This is the best time.

445
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,620
No one can ruin my life.

446
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,700
Not even the Imperial Guards.

447
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,820
Master.

448
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,420
Master.

449
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,820
Master.

450
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,940
Come in.

451
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,820
Master.

452
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,620
Something happened to Lord Lu.

453
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,860
What happened to Lord Lu?

454
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,460
There are assassins in our room.

455
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,980
Lord Lu was attacked by assassins.

456
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,660
He fainted.

457
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,460
He hasn't woken up yet.

458
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,060
What?

459
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,860
What happened?

460
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,940
Lord Lu was attacked when he went out of my room?

461
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,620
Xiao Lan.

462
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,660
You've been out recently.

463
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,380
You should be more careful.

464
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,300
Don't be too sad.

465
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,980
Don't risk your life.

466
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,940
You're old.

467
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,060
You won't be able to take such a big risk.

468
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,260
I know.

469
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,580
I made you worried.

470
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,300
Go.

471
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,760
Don't tell anyone.

472
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,980
Or they would take you back to your country.

473
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,500
Hurry up.

474
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,940
Move your feet!

475
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,000
Hurry up.

476
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,400
Don't waste time.

477
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Don't worry, chief.

478
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,720
I'll watch here.

479
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,520
You can go back and have a rest.

480
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,520
Turn around.

481
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,320
Stop findling the bloodshed now!

482
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,240
Pump up!

483
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Come on, move your feet!

484
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,720
Hurry up!

485
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,160
Don't waste time.

486
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,040
P They need to travel for a while.

487
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,000
Move it here.

488
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,840
No need.

489
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,760
Tell them to be careful with the goods inside.

490
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,240
Yes.

491
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,320
Be careful with the things inside.

492
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,440
If it breaks, you won't be able to pay for it even if you sell it.

493
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,040
Come. Be careful.

494
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,440
Come. Be careful.

495
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,360
Be careful.

496
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
Don't fall.

497
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,360
This way.

498
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,160
Come. Move those here.

499
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,440
Why are you here?

500
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,040
The port is very windy. I was afraid that you would catch a cold, so I brought you some clothes.

501
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,640
Oh, right. I saw that you were busy from early to late.

502
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,840
You didn't even have time to eat. So I cooked these especially for you.

503
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,040
Who told you to be nosy?

504
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,240
Under the public, you are so courteous to me. It's easy to get people to gossip.

505
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,840
You can go now. Do what you need to do. Don't surround me.

506
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,040
Miss Shangguan.

507
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Here. Take this.

508
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,240
I'm warning you. You better not show up in front of me again.

509
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,640
Or else, you won't be able to make friends.

510
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Miss Shangguan, are you really that heartless?

511
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Harder!

512
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,240
Yes.

513
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Hurry up. You are wasting time.

514
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Yes.

515
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,440
Hurry up.

516
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Yes, Master.

517
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
Hurry up. Hurry up.

518
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,640
Hurry up.

519
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,640
Hurry up.

520
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,240
Yes, Master.

521
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Come.

522
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,640
Put it here.

523
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,440
Be careful.

524
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,640
Come. Put it here.

525
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,040
Hurry up.

526
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,840
Hurry up.

527
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,040
Move your head and feet a little bit.

528
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Move your head and feet a little bit.

529
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,040
Ha Te.

530
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,040
Ha Te.

531
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,440
Master.

532
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,840
Master.

533
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,440
You're awake.

534
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,240
Who are you?

535
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,040
Master, what are you doing?

536
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,440
You...

537
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,240
Why are you calling me? I'm Jin Xia.

538
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,640
Jin Xia? I don't know any Jin Xia.

539
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,440
Master, what's wrong with you?

540
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,040
What are you doing here?

541
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,840
Master...

542
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,840
What's wrong with you? You really don't know me?

543
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm here to help Jin Xia.

544
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,240
I'm the one who helped you get out of Chang'an.

545
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,040
I'm the one who helped you get out of Chang'an.

546
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,440
Help?

547
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,240
I've never met anyone who helped me.

548
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,040
Speak!

549
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,640
Master.

550
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,840
Master, calm down first.

551
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,640
Let go of your hand first.

552
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
Wipe your hands.

553
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,040
You think of the Imperial Guards so much that you even put on clothes.

554
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,640
Let my father know that you're going to die.

555
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,240
Master, he's my relative.

556
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,840
Why didn't you say so earlier?

557
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
Are you okay?

558
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,840
Wait, Miss Yuan. Listen to me first.

559
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,040
What's wrong with you?

560
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,240
You look like...

561
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Like what?

562
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,840
Like seven years ago. He just called me Cen A Fu.

563
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,440
That's the name before I became the Imperial Guards.

564
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,840
Why are you wiping that knife?

565
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,640
That Xiu Chun knife isn't yours.

566
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,240
His previous owner is your best brother, A De.

567
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
A De?

568
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
They participated in the selection of the Imperial Guards together.

569
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,240
They trained together.

570
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,640
No wonder. He kept calling me A De in his dreams.

571
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,840
I heard that to become the last official of the Imperial Guards,

572
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,040
you had to break your love and love your brother.

573
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,440
You witnessed your brother die.

574
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,440
How did A De die?

575
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,240
A De was shot by a sword and died in that battle.

576
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,040
So you kept his knife.

577
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,640
His Majesty asked the Imperial Guards to take care of the criminal law.

578
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,040
He ordered some cold-blooded people to tie up their bodies.

579
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,240
To test if they were really heartless.

580
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,240
First, we have to start with killing our own friends.

581
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,640
This is why I hated the Imperial Guards so much in the past.

582
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,640
But after spending time with you,

583
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,440
I found that although he was strict,

584
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,640
he never shamed anyone.

585
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,040
He was always the first to come forward.

586
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,040
He even risked his life to save us.

587
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,040
So even if time has passed,

588
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,040
you still feel sad for A De's death.

589
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,640
People are people after all.

590
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
How can they be cold-blooded?

591
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,840
Your Excellency.

592
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Your Excellency, what's wrong?

593
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,240
Your Excellency, what's wrong?

594
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,040
Your Excellency.

595
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,240
Zeng Fu, go get the imperial physician.

596
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,840
Yes.

597
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,040
Your Excellency.

598
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,040
Your Excellency.

599
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,240
Your Excellency, you're fine.

600
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
His body is fine.

601
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
There are no external injuries.

602
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,040
His pulse is like a depression.

603
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,840
Depression?

604
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,040
Impossible.

605
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
How can it be depression?

606
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,840
From his pulse,

607
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,040
it really is like depression.

608
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,840
If he's like last time,

609
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,640
he'll be fine with the antidote.

610
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,040
But this depression...

611
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I don't know how to explain it.

612
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
It's like a disease.

613
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
But this disease...

614
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm not sure.

615
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,840
Li Yi, I know you'll find a way.

616
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
You must save His Excellency.

617
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,640
Don't worry.

618
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,840
I'll definitely find a way to save him.

619
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,240
But I have to think about it.

620
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,440
Aren't you a doctor?

621
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,840
How can you not have a solution?

622
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,240
If anything happens to His Excellency,

623
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
none of you can afford it.

624
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,640
You don't believe in my medical skills?

625
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,840
If you don't believe me,

626
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,040
then you should ask for another one.

627
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,640
Dr. Lin!

628
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,640
My person has lost his mind.

629
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Please forgive him.

630
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,040
Third Uncle, if I'm really sick,

631
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,640
please listen to the doctor.

632
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,240
Although I don't know what happened,

633
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I'm still worried about you.

634
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,040
But your body is yours.

635
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
I believe in you.

636
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,840
During this time,

637
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,640
I'll prescribe some medicine to help you.

638
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,240
See if it can help you.

639
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,640
Okay.

640
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Li Yi, I'll see you out.

641
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Rest well.

642
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,840
I'll go.

643
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,240
Master Shangguan,

644
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,440
I've been disturbed by your help.

645
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,640
Thank you for taking care of me.

646
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
I still have some important matters to do.

647
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,040
I can't stay long.

648
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,240
I left on a first-come, first-served basis.

649
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,440
I know you don't want to see me.

650
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,040
I don't want you to worry too much.

651
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,040
Master is busy.

652
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,840
You must take care of your health.

653
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,040
Rest well.

654
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,240
Remember to eat on time.

655
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Yang Yue Liu.

656
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,240
I'm sorry.

657
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,440
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,040
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
I'm sorry.

660
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I'm sorry.

661
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm sorry.

662
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
I'm sorry.

664
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,040
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,040
I'm sorry.

666
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
I'm sorry.

667
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
I'm sorry.

670
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm sorry.

672
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,440
Master,

673
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,040
this is the news from Miss Zhai.

674
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,560
Always may.

675
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,840
The Record-w drove the three poisoned goddess of Lan Yu, Lin.

676
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,400
This is Lin.

677
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,680
Which

678
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,640
Liang?

679
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,280
How did you find her

680
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,660
Face Cut

681
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,520
What are you doing?

682
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
How is it?

683
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,040
My bed is quite big.

684
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Get lost.

685
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
What?

686
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
Get lost.

687
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
I didn't hear you.

688
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
Say it again.

689
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
I said get lost.

690
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
What if I don't?

691
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
A breath of grass and herbs.

692
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,040
I've heard that people from the Medicine King Valley are good at it.

693
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
It's really amazing.

694
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
If you know it, you can break the spell.

695
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Fang Ling, learn it.

696
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
You can have a soul mate.

697
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
What do you want?

698
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
What do you think?

699
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Don't touch me.

700
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Don't touch me.

701
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Yan Shi Fan.

702
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
If anything happens to me,

703
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
the people from the Medicine King Valley won't let you go.

704
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
Are you really stupid or are you pretending to be stupid?

705
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
Do you think I'm afraid of the people from the Medicine King Valley?

706
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
Besides,

707
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
this time,

708
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
you're the one who killed yourself

709
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
and got into my bed.

710
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
If someone wants to catch up with you,

711
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
it's also the people from the Medicine King Valley

712
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
who are trying to assassinate the government officials.

713
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
You have to be the third party.

714
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
So,

715
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
I give you an advice.

716
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Listen to me.

717
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,040
If you're happy with me,

718
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
maybe you can divorce me.

719
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
Divorce me.

720
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
If I listen to you,

721
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
will you let me go?

722
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Yes.

723
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Okay.

724
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
I'll listen to you.

725
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Wait.

726
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,040
You...

727
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
You let me go first.

728
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Okay.

729
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
It's really boring to tie you up.

730
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Six inches.

731
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Not big, not small, not fat, not thin.

732
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
The more beautiful the person is,

733
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
the more beautiful the feet are.

734
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Bitch.

735
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Bitch.

736
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Bitch.
