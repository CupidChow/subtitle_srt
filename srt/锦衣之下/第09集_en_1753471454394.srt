is not for everyone.

71
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,960
Besides,

72
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,760
the instrument is not of high or low.

73
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,440
You are too modest.

74
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
I rarely see

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
a man like you

76
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
who is so ordinary.

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
I am lucky to have you

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,240
in my life.

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,600
It's my honor

80
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,320
to meet you.

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,840
Please sit down, young master.

82
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,120
Gui,

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
have some tea.

84
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,480
Yes.

85
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,440
the first time i've seen you,

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:44,240
it seems a place

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,720
with a great variety.

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,160
Just sort it out.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Please.

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,880
It's really good tea.

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,840
Miss Zha,

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
this dress looks so good on you.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,160
The embroidery and needlework

94
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
are all made by the Ming family.

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm just a housekeeper.

96
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,080
Sorry for your embarrassment.

97
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,200
It's okay.

98
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,560
My clothes

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
are not made by the Ming family.

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
I just embroidered it

101
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
without any reason.

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,560
You're so talented.

103
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
You're so sweet.

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
It's so cute.

105
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,120
We just wanted to have a little fun.

106
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,760
I didn't expect to bother you this time.

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,560
It's just a small matter.

108
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,640
You don't have to mind it.

109
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,240
I have a matter

110
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,200
to ask you.

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,480
What's up?

112
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,120
Are you getting married now?

113
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,640
My son...

114
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,960
I've been married

115
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,880
a long time ago.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
You're so kind.

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
I think many people

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,840
will come to your house to talk about marriage.

119
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
To be honest,

120
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,640
many people are after the blue-leaf tree.

121
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,080
There are people who come to ask for it.

122
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,640
But I've never been in love with anyone.

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,000
They're just greedy and beautiful.

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
I've never had a true lover.

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
I don't dare to be dependent on anyone.

126
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm not lucky.

127
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,160
I'm just a beast.

128
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
You're thinking too much.

129
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,240
Such a good man must have a good reason.

130
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,520
Tell me.

131
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,160
What did you find out?

132
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
Sir.

133
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,240
You've been with him for a long time.

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,840
People are asking if you're married.

135
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,040
Speaking of clues,

136
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,240
you know more than we do.

137
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
You mean

138
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,240
I should report to you now?

139
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
I don't dare to.

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
There are not many clues.

141
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,040
I can only see that the house is quite nice.

142
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,240
The house is well-maintained.

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
It's not a bad place.

144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
It's not a bad place.

145
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
It's not a bad place.

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
It's not a good place.

147
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
But the maid is nice.

148
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,240
Her house is close to the dock.

149
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
It should be near the lake.

150
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Recently, she went out secretly.

151
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
She even got a cold.

152
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,440
And,

153
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I have to say,

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
the exhibition is mostly controlled by someone.

155
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,240
They have to control the show.

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,640
Go on.

157
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,840
First,

158
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
the shoes are clean.

159
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
But the shoes of the maid are dirty.

160
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,640
It means

161
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
they were wearing a sedan chair before they boarded the boat.

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,040
If they were far away,

163
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,640
they would choose to wear a carriage.

164
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,840
Second,

165
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,440
there are five or six scratches on Zhai Lanye's shoe.

166
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,640
It's obvious that his maid

167
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,240
was careless when she was scraping off the mud.

168
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,240
A gentle and gentle girl like Zhai Lanye,

169
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,640
she must have so many mud on her shoes

170
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,040
that she could get it on her shoes when she went out on a rainy day.

171
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,840
She didn't sit down and ride a carriage.

172
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,040
So she went out secretly.

173
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,040
Third,

174
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,440
Zhai Lanye was cold.

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
Her family doesn't lack money.

176
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,640
But she insisted on taking care of the patient.

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,440
It costs 10,000 taels to marry her.

178
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
It means that the Yang family wants to rely on her to get money.

179
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,240
How can we say that the Yang family doesn't lack money?

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,040
The price of the goods on the boat

181
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,440
is more than 2,000 taels.

182
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,840
Not to mention the chessboard she played.

183
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
It's a famous game.

184
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
It's priceless.

185
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,640
I heard that

186
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,840
the Yang family is the uncle of the Zhi family.

187
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,040
The day before Zhou Xianyi was arrested,

188
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
what kind of weather was it?

189
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,440
Sir,

190
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
I remember that

191
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
the man on the paper was a rainy day.

192
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,640
Could it be that the man who had a private meeting with Zhai Lanye was Zhou Xianyi?

193
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,840
I only took 10,000 taels

194
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,240
and paid him in full.

195
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,640
Sir Lu,

196
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
how can you believe that?

197
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,840
Tomorrow night,

198
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
I must know which year Zhai Lanye was kidnapped,

199
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
who her parents were,

200
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
and who she had contacted.

201
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,040
And,

202
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,440
the most important thing is,

203
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,040
where did Zhai Lanye go

204
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,640
after Zhou Xianyi was arrested?

205
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,040
I understand.

206
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,240
But,

207
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,040
why don't you ask Zhai Lanye

208
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,240
about Zhou Xianyi directly?

209
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
According to her,

210
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,040
Zhou Xianyi is a single-lover.

211
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,040
There are many people who pursue Lanye.

212
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,440
There are also those who sell land to seek a home.

213
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
But Lanye

214
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
never loves anyone.

215
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Even you think about it.

216
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
If I tell her again,

217
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,440
can she answer me in a silly way?

218
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,840
That's right.

219
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,840
Sir,

220
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
isn't it good

221
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
that the beauty took the initiative today?

222
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,040
Zhai Lanye is fair and simple.

223
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,440
I can't help thinking about how beautiful she is.

224
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
What are you talking about?

225
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
What are you talking about?

226
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,440
Listen,

227
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
don't expose your love.

228
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
Hush.

229
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,040
Humph.

230
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
Everyone,

231
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,140
attention.

232
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,200
misunderstand.

233
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,440
Thank you.

234
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,640
He also had a wife.

235
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,440
Xiao Zhiqing

236
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
It's you.

237
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,880
died

238
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,760
Are you

239
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,040
Your Lordship, Zhou Xianyi's dead.

240
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,280
Died?

241
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,400
yes

242
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,600
Hendry BS

243
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,160
He has big eyes

244
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,320
Andíry fixated on20

245
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,160
He seemed to be very scared before he died.

246
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,240
Besides,

247
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,440
he didn't have any obvious wounds

248
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,040
or any symptoms of poisoning.

249
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,440
It must be that his heart stopped

250
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
and he died of jealousy in a short time.

251
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
The prison gate was never broken.

252
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
But Zhou Xianyi's death

253
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
didn't seem to be natural.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,320
Did he get poisoned?

255
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Yuan Buke.

256
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
As a member of the official family,

257
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,280
do you believe in these nonsense?

258
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,120
No.

259
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,640
I mean

260
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,600
his death was too evil.

261
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,440
It's my first time to meet someone

262
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,680
who can kill without a knife in the prison.

263
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
If we want to find out the real murderer,

264
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,040
we need to find out

265
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
the real cause of his death.

266
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,440
The cause of his death

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,360
is up to Yuan Buke to investigate.

268
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,880
Mr. Lu.

269
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,240
Zhou Xianyi is now in prison

270
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,880
for corruption.

271
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,880
He must have committed suicide for the crime.

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,920
I think

273
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,560
we should report to His Majesty

274
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
to settle this case.

275
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,520
Mr. Wei.

276
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,240
Are you teaching me how to do things

277
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,000
or are you trying to push me?

278
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,720
I dare not.

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,720
Please make the decision, Mr. Lu.

280
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,280
You are a coward.

281
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,080
Behave yourself.

282
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,840
Come on.

283
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,280
whistle blowsIGly.

284
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,480
Enough. Let's get to work.

285
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,240
Mr. Lu.

286
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,360
There is a ballot paper

287
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,420
due to the

288
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
tw inches missing.

289
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
How is the recovery?

290
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,880
Thank you for your concern

291
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,720
It's much better

292
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,200
It seems that this Doctor Shen is indeed unheard of

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,480
By the way, master

294
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,960
Zhou Xianyi died in a state of shock

295
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,360
His death is so strange, what do you think?

296
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,560
You can check later

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
if there are other clues

298
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Yes

299
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
The dishes are ready, we are all hungry

300
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Let's eat

301
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Master, please

302
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Ok

303
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Master

304
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Do you remember last summer

305
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
in the old house in the south of the city

306
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes

307
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
There was a corpse

308
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
in it for more than a month

309
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
No one found it

310
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
after staying in it for more than a month

311
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Then the whole room was full of insects

312
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Compared with today,

313
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Zhou Xianyi is really a big deal

314
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Ok

315
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Do you remember?

316
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
The corpse at that time

317
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
didn't even want to check the five characters

318
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
You checked it yourself

319
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
You also asked me and Dayang

320
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
to pick out the insects

321
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
We picked it for two hours

322
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
We couldn't eat for three days

323
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Master, I tell you

324
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
The insect

325
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
was soaked in blood at that time

326
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
It was white and fat

327
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
It was still there

328
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
It was so cute

329
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
It looked like

330
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,520
like the rice soaked in soup

331
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Dayang

332
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
The insects we picked at that time

333
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
were enough for four or five people

334
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
You are not enough for one person

335
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Master, please enjoy

336
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
I'll go and see if the grass is enough for the horse

337
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Master, eat

338
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Eat

339
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Master

340
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
That insect

341
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I was thinking

342
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
If I could dig out

343
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
the ten thousand pieces of it

344
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
one by one

345
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Ok, take your time

346
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Master Luo

347
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Master, eat more

348
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
What are you looking at?

349
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Eat, eat

350
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
You can still eat

351
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
I just want to disgust him

352
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Think about how he treated us all the way

353
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
It's not easy to take this opportunity

354
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I have to keep it

355
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Kill the enemy and kill three thousand

356
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
What a bunch of food

357
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I can't eat anymore

358
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
If I knew it was in Beijing

359
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
I would let you have three meals a day

360
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
and eat with the coroner

361
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll go to the kitchen

362
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
and see if there are buns

363
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Master, enjoy

364
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
I just heard that

365
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Zhou Xianyi is dead

366
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
I don't know where the ten thousand taels of money are

367
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Liao Aiqing

368
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Yes

369
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
You are the Minister of Works

370
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Tell me what happened

371
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Your Majesty

372
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,520
When Zhou Xianyi brought the money

373
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
he refused to let the guards escort him

374
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
He invited the gang

375
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I suspect that

376
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Zhou Xianyi wanted to take the money

377
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
and colluded with the gang

378
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,520
and caused the gang to be in trouble

379
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Colluding with the gang

380
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
will damage the reputation of the court

381
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
and the safety of the court

382
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Minister Yan

383
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Minister Yan

384
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Yes

385
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
The Ministry of Personnel should investigate this

386
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Don't worry, Your Majesty

387
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,520
I'll lead the Ministry of Personnel to investigate

388
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Your Majesty

389
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
The ten thousand taels of money are stolen

390
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
The national treasury can't be lost

391
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
The most important thing now

392
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
is to find the lost treasury

393
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
to avoid public criticism

394
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
and cause a public grudge

395
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Liao Aiqing

396
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Yes

397
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
The money was lost by your Ministry of Works

398
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
You should leave it to the Ministry of Works

399
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
to find it

400
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
You can't lose a penny

401
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Yes

402
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Yes

403
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Your Majesty

404
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Your Majesty

405
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
You are having a headache again

406
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Should I ask the doctor to check it for you?

407
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
No need

408
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Leave

409
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Leave

410
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Leave

411
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Leave

412
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
I'll leave

413
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Liao Aiqing

414
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Stay

415
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Your Majesty

416
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Liao Aiqing

417
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,520
You have to investigate this

418
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
If a small man

419
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,520
can steal the ten thousand taels of money

420
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,520
it means that the court has many loopholes

421
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
You should investigate it

422
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Investigate it

423
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I will obey your order

424
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Please take care of yourself

425
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I'll leave

426
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Lord Lu

427
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
I have something to report to you

428
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
May I help you?

429
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Come in

430
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Yes

431
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Lord Lu

432
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
What's up?

433
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
This is the ticket for the boat

434
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
The boat fee is two taels

435
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
The tea and snacks on the boat are five taels

436
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,520
The total is two taels and five taels

437
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Please have a look

438
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
I can pay for the boat

439
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
But the tea and snacks

440
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
You seem to have eaten all the snacks

441
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
I didn't

442
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I can pay for the boat

443
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
How can you do that?

444
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
I

445
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I only had a few snacks

446
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
I don't know how much they are

447
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
I have no idea

448
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
This is the ticket for the boat

449
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I have no idea

450
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I

451
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
I have no idea

452
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I have no idea

453
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
I have no idea

454
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I have no idea

455
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I have no idea

456
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
I have no idea

457
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
A few snacks

458
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
You are so kind

459
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Yuan Jinxia

460
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Yuan Jinxia

461
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
You are so mean

462
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
You ate five thousand taels

463
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,520
You have been eating it for a month

464
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Why is the ground so dirty?

465
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
I can clean it for you

466
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
It's not good

467
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Okay

468
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
As long as you live comfortably

469
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I should do it

470
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
There is more

471
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Why is there dust on the green paper?

472
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
I will clean it

473
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
The door is not clean

474
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
I will clean it

475
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Okay, sir

476
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I cleaned all the places I could

477
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Please check it

478
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
This

479
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
This

480
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
This

481
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I have done my work

482
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Well

483
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
The silver

484
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Is it

485
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
Tonight

486
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Go to the building where Zhou Xianyi lives

487
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Go upstairs and light the lamp

488
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Open the window and wait inside

489
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
After he makes a noise three times

490
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
You can blow the lamp down the building

491
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
What about the silver?

492
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
The silver will be blown

493
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
You are so wise

494
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I will clean it for you

495
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Okay

496
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I will go to the building where Zhou Xianyi lives

497
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Go

498
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Go

499
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Go

500
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Go

501
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Go

502
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Go

503
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Go

504
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Go

505
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Go

506
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Go

507
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Go

508
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Go

509
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Go

510
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Go

511
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Go

512
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Go

513
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Go

514
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Go

515
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Go

516
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Go

517
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Go

518
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Go

519
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Go

520
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Go

521
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
If I don't hear the chicken

522
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
I will stay here until the new year

523
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I miss you

524
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Come

525
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Great

526
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I am so happy to have you here

527
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
I want to ask you something

528
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Do you know if there are chickens around here?

529
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
If there are chickens

530
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
You may eat them

531
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Right?

532
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Right?

533
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Go

534
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Hurry up

535
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Is it?

536
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Go

537
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Hurry up

538
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Why are you following me?

539
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Come

540
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Come

541
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Come

542
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Sir

543
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Sir

544
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
I am late

545
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Please forgive me

546
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
What did you find on the building?

547
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
The building where you live is the mansion

548
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
I looked out the window of Zhou Xianyi's house

549
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
I saw Zhai Lanye's room

550
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
It's so suspicious

551
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
The point is

552
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Zhai Lanye moved away after Zhou Xianyi was arrested

553
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I think

554
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Zhai Lanye didn't say it himself

555
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
He is so close to Zhou Xianyi

556
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Let's go

557
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
I just guess

558
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,520
I need to find another chance to meet Zhai Lanye

559
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
The cat is afraid of water

560
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
It's raining

561
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
It's so heart-breaking

562
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Sir

563
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
Don't you think I'm heart-breaking too?

564
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
By the way

565
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,520
You told me to stay in that building

566
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
It's said that the chicken is three times bigger

567
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
It's a good place

568
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Zhou Xianyi's way of thinking is strange

569
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
I think there is something dirty in the building

570
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I want you to be honest with me

571
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Staying for a long time is always good

572
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Are you kidding me?

573
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Am I not like this in your heart?

574
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Of course not

575
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,520
I know you did this to break me down

576
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
You can think like this

577
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Sir

578
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
I'm so loyal

579
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Can I get a reward?

580
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
It's said that the soup is very famous

581
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Can I?

582
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Take it

583
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Sir

584
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
What's up?

585
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Someone came to see you

586
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Who?

587
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Zhai Lanye

588
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Zhai Lanye

589
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
You came to see me

590
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
You must know who I am

591
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I didn't know it was you

592
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
I'm sorry for my offense

593
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
I'm sorry

594
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
You don't blame me for hiding it?

595
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I know you do things

596
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
You're clever

597
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Are you not curious about what I know?

598
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,520
You and Shangguan are friends

599
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Since we parted

600
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
I've been sailing in the West Lake

601
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
I hope to see you again

602
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Until Shangguan told me

603
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Mr. Lu is actually Mr. Lu

604
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Zhou Xianyi died in the prison

605
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
How could it be?

606
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
We know Zhou Xianyi

607
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
since he lost the money

608
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Now he's dead

609
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
You can get rid of your suspicion

610
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
What do you mean?

611
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
The manager came to investigate

612
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
the corruption of the money

613
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Well

614
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
This is the Mr. Lu you met

615
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
in the West Lake

616
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Since last time

617
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
I've missed you every day

618
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
since I met you last time

619
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
So

620
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
I went to investigate you

621
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
I found out you had been

622
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
close to Zhou Xianyi

623
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
in the past few months

624
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
You're a smart girl

625
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
You won't forget him

626
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
I

627
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I remember him

628
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
He's a man of his word

629
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
I didn't expect

630
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
he would

631
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
Did you hear from him

632
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
about the money he spent on the repair?

633
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
I only know he came to Yangzhou

634
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
to repair the river

635
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
and to keep the secret

636
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
How did you know?

637
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
I've only seen him

638
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,520
three or four times

639
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
It's just a small talk

640
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
I know little about him

641
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
He never mentioned

642
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
the court affairs to me

643
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Know little about him?

644
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
You used four words

645
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
to get rid of your suspicion

646
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
You even risked your life

647
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
for your son

648
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Although Lanyan is not from a rich family

649
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
he has read the novel of the hunting girl

650
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
You mean

651
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
you want Lanyan

652
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
to be homeless?

653
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I won't lie to you

654
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
My father raised me for years

655
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
His Majesty made a rule

656
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
that I should get married

657
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
with 10,000 taels of silver

658
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
10,000 taels is not a small amount

659
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
But compared to the repair

660
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
it's nothing

661
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
I'm just a woman

662
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Actually

663
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
I've been to Zhou's Mansion once

664
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Outside the window of the prison

665
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
guess what I saw

666
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
What?

667
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I saw the girl's body

668
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
Do you think

669
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
there is such a coincidence?

670
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
But

671
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
she was locked in the prison

672
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
and you were also taken away

673
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
You are really a good person

674
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,520
Actually I'm the same as you

675
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,520
I'm very familiar with your talent

676
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
He wanted me to raise him

677
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
I didn't refuse

678
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
I gave him a sachet

679
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
and he gave me a box of rouge

680
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
That's all

681
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Lanyan is just a

682
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
young man who is being bullied

683
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
He has no choice

684
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
except to die

685
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Sir, you must believe me

686
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
I'm really innocent

687
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
I've never loved any man

688
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
except you

689
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Since I saw you for the first time

690
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
I was so relieved

691
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Okay

692
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Since you have nothing to do with this case

693
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
you can rest assured

694
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
Great

695
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
You can see the real thing

696
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
in your hat

697
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Great

698
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
You want me to thank you

699
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
because you let me watch the opera with you

700
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
I can't believe

701
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
you are so rough

702
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
and so well-mannered

703
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Don't look down on me

704
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
I'm not like Lu Yi

705
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
who is a senior official

706
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
but I'm also from a rich family

707
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Of course, listening to opera

708
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
is a normal hobby

709
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
It's good to have money

710
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
I brought you here

711
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
because this troupe is called Chunxi troupe

712
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
A few years ago, it was popular in Yangzhou

713
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
and it was popular all over the city

714
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Later, because of a fatal case

715
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
it was gone

716
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
A fatal case

717
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I came here to see

718
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
if I could hear the first box

719
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
That's the best song I've ever heard

720
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Great

721
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Great

722
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Great

723
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Let's go

724
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Little Erca

725
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Pour some water

726
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
How's it?

727
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Is it good?

728
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Great

729
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Forget it if you can't hear it

730
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
Great

731
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I heard Zhou Xianyi died in prison

732
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Yes

733
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
The cause is unknown

734
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
He has no wounds

735
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
If he died of a shock

736
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
it's not like

737
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
Aren't you a disciple of the Southern Shaolin School?

738
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
In your opinion

739
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,520
except for the extreme stimulation in the soul

740
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
in what situation

741
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
will the ear be broken after death?

742
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
I remember what you said

743
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Master once told me

744
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
that there is a kind of acupoint called the neck bone

745
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
If you force the acupoint

746
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
it will cause the ear to break

747
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
and die of bleeding in the brain

748
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Neck bone

749
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
I remember the death method I just mentioned

750
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
The fatal case that happened in Chunxi troupe

751
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
a few years ago

752
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
the dead was the death method

753
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
The government couldn't find it out

754
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
and they even spread the rumor

755
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
that it was a ghost who committed crimes

756
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
The ghost was there

757
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
but had nowhere to go

758
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
When did he suddenly die?

759
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
The fatal case that happened in Chunxi troupe

760
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
died cause was that death method

761
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
Is this a coincidence?

762
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,240
You scared me so much.

763
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Sir, are you a cat?

764
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Why didn't you wake up? You scared me to death.

765
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Only people who did something bad will be scared to death.

766
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,240
What? Did Yuan Bu Kui do something bad?

767
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,240
How could I do something bad? I'm not like you.

768
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,240
You're also a bit of a bad person.

769
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Sir, why are you here?

770
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I heard from Yang Yue that you want to re-examine Zhou Xian Yi's body.

771
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I guessed that you must have a new discovery, so I came.

772
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Sir, you really know what to do.

773
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Sir, look.

774
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
This needle is the one that took Zhou Xian Yi's life.

775
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Oh, right. I also heard from Xie Xiao that Yangzhou had a similar case a few years ago.

776
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Xie Xiao, Xie Xiao.

777
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,240
You came to Yangzhou for such a short time, why are you fighting with Xie Xiao?

778
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,240
It seems that you're not interested in this job anymore.

779
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,240
I am. Sir.

780
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,240
I'm fighting with Xie Xiao because I want to find clues.

781
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,240
Sir, wait for me. I'm scared.

782
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Sir, you look like a normal person.

783
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,240
You look more like a relative.

784
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
I'm going to find the clues.

785
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Okay.

786
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Okay.

787
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Okay.

788
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Okay.

789
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,240
Okay.

790
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,240
Okay.

791
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Okay.

792
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Okay.

793
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,240
This is such a good idea.

794
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Why don't you go to Yang Yue or Ceng Fu and come to me?

795
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Because you are more handsome than them.

796
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Besides looking at your figure and voice, you have to look at your face.

797
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,240
This is the most correct sentence I have ever said since I met you.

798
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Boss, give me one.

799
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Okay.

800
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Boss, catch him!

801
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
Catch him!

802
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Stop!

803
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Catch him!

804
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Catch him!

805
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
Catch him!

806
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Is this yours?

807
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Yes.

808
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Thank you.

809
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
Thank you.

810
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
I'm so grateful.

811
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
You're welcome.

812
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I don't know how to address you.

813
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I'm Yuan Jinxia.

814
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,240
This is my brother-in-law, Lu Shisan.

815
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Okay.

816
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Nice to meet you.

817
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm the head of the Spring Class.

818
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
My class is in front of us.

819
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
If you don't mind,

820
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
please come with me.

821
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
I'll treat you well.

822
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
No need.

823
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
You're the head?

824
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Yes.

825
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
That's great.

826
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
Brother, you know that

827
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
I've been a fan of opera since I was a kid.

828
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Isn't it great?

829
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Right?

830
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Boss.

831
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
I've been a fan of opera since I was a kid.

832
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
I also want to learn it when I grow up.

833
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
But unfortunately,

834
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
our hometown was hit by a flood.

835
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,240
My brother and I are all dead.

836
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,240
We escaped to Yangzhou.

837
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
We had no food and no clothes.

838
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,240
We couldn't eat or wear well.

839
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
We had nightmares every day.

840
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,240
I don't know what to do next.

841
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
I see.

842
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,240
I saw your martial arts skills.

843
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,240
I've learned a little from the master of our neighboring village.

844
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I have an idea.

845
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
I'm recruiting students for the Spring Class.

846
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
You look extraordinary.

847
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
It's a great honor to be rewarded.

848
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
Now we meet,

849
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
it's a great fate.

850
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Why don't you come back with me?

851
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
Really?

852
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Okay.

853
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
No need.

854
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Okay.

855
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Boss, we have food.

856
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
We don't need to eat.

857
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
I've been drinking for two days.

858
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Okay, okay, okay, boss.

859
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Thank you.

860
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Thank you, boss.

861
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Please.

862
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Okay, boss.

863
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Thank you.

864
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Let's go.

865
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
Let's go.

866
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Come on.

867
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
This is our Spring Class.

868
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Changsheng, come here.

869
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
You know,

870
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
this is a new apprentice.

871
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,240
This is your senior, Changsheng.

872
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,240
He will take care of you in the future.

873
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Changsheng,

874
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
take them around

875
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
and let them get familiar with the Spring Class.

876
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
Okay.

877
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Come on, this way.

878
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
This is where we usually practice.

879
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
There are costumes and props.

880
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Changsheng,

881
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
how long have you been in the Spring Class?

882
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
More than ten years.

883
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
What about the class leader?

884
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Has he been here all the time?

885
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
The whole Spring Class

886
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
is built by the class leader.

887
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
It's been more than twenty years.

888
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,240
The class leader

889
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
is a little strict in daily life.

890
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
But he is very nice to everyone.

891
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
If anyone has any difficulties,

892
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
the class leader will always help.

893
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
I don't think

894
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
there are many apprentices.

895
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
You didn't see

896
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
the situation of our Spring Class.

897
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
It was full of people.

898
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
There was no need to be happy.

899
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
They were all going to our first row.

900
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
First row?

901
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Anyway,

902
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
you will feel it

903
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
when you come here.

904
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
I believe our Spring Class

905
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
will definitely be

906
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
as good as it was back then.

907
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Let's go.

908
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
I'll take you to pick some costumes

909
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
and put them on.

910
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
I'll take you to practice your voice.

911
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Okay.

912
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
Let's go.

913
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
This way.

914
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Brother 13, let's go.

915
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,240
If you want to be a good student,

916
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
you can't fail.

917
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,240
You are still good at acting.

918
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,240
I'm not a good student.

919
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,240
I'm a bad student.

920
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
I'm sorry.

921
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
I'm sorry.

922
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
I'm sorry.

923
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
I'm sorry.

925
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm sorry.

926
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
I'm sorry.

927
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm sorry.

928
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
I'm sorry.

929
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
I'm sorry.

930
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
I'm sorry.

931
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
I'm sorry.

932
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
I'm sorry.

933
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
I'm sorry.

934
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
I'm sorry.

935
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
I'm sorry.

936
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
I'm sorry.

937
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
I'm sorry.

938
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,240
I'm sorry.

939
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
I'm sorry.

940
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
I'm sorry.

941
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
I'm sorry.

942
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm sorry.

944
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,240
I'm sorry.

945
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
I'm sorry.

946
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
I'm sorry.

947
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
I'm sorry.

948
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
I'm sorry.

949
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
I'm sorry.

950
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
I'm sorry.

951
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
I'm sorry.

952
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm sorry.

953
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
I'm sorry.

954
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
I'm sorry.

955
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
I'm sorry.

956
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,240
I'm sorry.

957
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
I'm sorry.

958
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,240
I'm sorry.

959
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
I'm sorry.

960
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I'm sorry.

961
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,240
I'm sorry.

962
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
I'm sorry.

963
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
