After audience

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,000
I am so great

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Recently, my sister

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Has started to accompany and receive

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Music from your beloved),

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,000
On the Congress

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and leave a bloodline to the Xia family.

58
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,760
It's the Yigu of the Xia family.

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
You took care of her before.

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,880
Now you don't need to.

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,480
Ling'er,

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
what do you mean?

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
Lu Yi has come to propose.

64
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Lu Yi is Lu Ting's eldest son.

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,560
If he marries Jin Xia,

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,040
he can protect her

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,760
with her identity.

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,840
That's a good idea.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,560
No.

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Absolutely no.

71
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,640
If Lu Ting knows Xia'er's background,

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,360
no.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,520
Come.

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,680
You have been waiting for so long?

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,080
Sir,

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,760
I can't wait for long.

77
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
Sir,

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
I have a huge secret

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,560
that you want to know.

80
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,680
What secret?

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,640
I find her family in the fields.

82
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
I know all kinds of people here.

83
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,040
But they are no longer in the world.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,880
I can't see them anymore.

85
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,560
She really knows everything.

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,040
I didn't expect that.

87
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,400
I usually call Dr. Ling as Aunt Ling.

88
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
She is really my aunt.

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,600
Aunt Jin.

90
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
My mother is her sister.

91
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Really?

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,760
What a coincidence.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,720
My grandfather is a famous doctor in Quanzhou.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,880
No wonder my medical skills are so good.

95
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
Do you know who my grandfather is?

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,920
Xia Ran.

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,800
I didn't expect that I had such a relationship with the former governor.

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
And Xia Ran.

99
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,120
Stop talking.

100
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,040
Father.

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,680
You could save them all.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
But because you are afraid of Yan family's power.

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,800
You can only see them with your own eyes.

104
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
They will be destroyed.

105
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,280
Our family used to be a high-ranking official.

106
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,280
Although they all say that my grandfather is a sinner.

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,240
But I know that he was framed.

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
Yan family is my biggest enemy.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,720
Dr. Ling.

110
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
Did he tell you to take revenge?

111
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,760
No.

112
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
But my family was ruined.

113
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
I must take revenge.

114
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
I will find out who framed my grandfather.

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,280
Yan family is the first one who can't be free.

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,960
Jin Xia.

117
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,680
Yan family's power is not what you can imagine.

118
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
You must keep your identity secret.

119
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,560
No matter how much hatred you have.

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,560
Don't be impulsive.

121
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,920
Dang Marquis Yan Residing in Lin Mountain

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,400
Jin Xia.

123
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,880
Why does Xia Yan's granduncle,

124
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
only like you?

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:47,100
I, happened to meet some false

126
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:29,120
for the hidden harbor of Qu Yuan藏 from people at the Qu Yanao's

127
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,180
When we suddenly meet…

128
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,080
Has something happened?

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,420
well…

130
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,700
You asked me out so late

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,780
You know we shouldn't meet and have a chat

132
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,580
I really can't stand the way you look.

133
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,180
If you believe me, just tell me.

134
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,700
I won't tell anyone.

135
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,420
How much do you know about Xia Ran's case?

136
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,020
Xia Ran from the former governor's mansion?

137
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,060
That's a long-standing case.

138
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,860
Yes.

139
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,060
It happened more than ten years ago.

140
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,060
You said it was more than ten years ago.

141
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,260
What does it have to do with you?

142
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,260
You were only five, six, seven, eight years old at that time.

143
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,820
That year, I was a lowly man.

144
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,580
I was severely beaten and the court was over.

145
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,580
I was still young at that time.

146
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,460
I only heard my master say that.

147
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,660
I never said anything like that.

148
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,220
It seems that the emperor had approved Xia Ran

149
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,860
to resign from the post of governor.

150
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,580
Later, the real cause of Xia Ran's death

151
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,220
was a letter from the city of Qiu.

152
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,660
It was said that Yan Song ordered the city of Qiu

153
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,860
to impeach Xia Ran and cut ties with him.

154
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,180
You know, it's a capital crime to cut ties with the border guards.

155
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Xia Ran's death was also destroyed by this letter.

156
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,860
Yes.

157
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,660
The city of Qiu was in the state of Zhao.

158
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,860
How did Yan Song get this letter?

159
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,660
Zhao?

160
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,260
Wasn't your father in charge at that time?

161
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
It must be your father.

162
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
This has something to do with your father.

163
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,060
At that time, someone impeached him.

164
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,660
It was Xia Ran who released him.

165
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,860
Since then, my father has been cruel to him.

166
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,460
Wait a minute.

167
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,460
I don't understand.

168
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Xia Ran released your father.

169
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,860
Your father was cruel to Xia Ran?

170
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,860
At that time, my father went to the door himself.

171
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,460
He was low and low.

172
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
He knelt down and let him go.

173
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
I understand.

174
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,860
Your family has been officials for generations.

175
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,060
What is your father's identity?

176
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,460
He is so arrogant.

177
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,660
He would give up his dignity and kowtow to Xia Ran.

178
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,460
It's normal that he can't swallow this anger.

179
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,260
But you didn't expect

180
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,060
Jin Xia is Xia Ran's granddaughter.

181
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,260
Xia Changqing's daughter.

182
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,460
Jin Xia is the descendant of the Xia family.

183
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,260
Then you two are not...

184
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,060
You are enemies.

185
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,060
There are hundreds of people in the Xia family.

186
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,060
There are more than 70 people in the Lian family.

187
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,260
If Jin Xia knows this,

188
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,260
how can I face her?

189
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,060
If I were her,

190
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,860
I would hate you.

191
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,660
I'm afraid Jin Xia

192
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,860
can't stand between the enemy and me.

193
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,260
That's true.

194
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,260
Jin Xia's personality

195
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,660
probably won't hate you.

196
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,460
She won't even blame you.

197
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,260
In the end,

198
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,060
she can only blame the sky and earth.

199
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,260
She will hate herself.

200
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,260
I don't want her to be like that.

201
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,860
That will ruin her.

202
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,460
What should you do?

203
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,860
I...

204
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,460
I don't know what to do.

205
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,060
Come on, drink.

206
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,660
ss

207
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,860
Aunt. You scared me.

208
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,860
What are you laughing at?

209
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,660
I want to embroider a word, but it's too difficult.

210
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,180
You came at the right time.

211
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
Come, let me help you.

212
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,260
You embroidered...

213
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,660
Xia.

214
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,340
Xia.

215
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,540
Why do you think of embroidering a word?

216
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
For Lord Lu.

217
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,860
Oh, I know.

218
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,820
You gave me this handkerchief

219
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,500
because you want it to stay with you

220
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,700
and miss you at any time, right?

221
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,740
You can say that.

222
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,620
It also means that I can stay with it forever.

223
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,220
Yes.

224
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,620
Look.

225
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,460
Look, your side is messy.

226
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,860
You have to tear it again.

227
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,940
Forget it, I'll tear it for you, okay?

228
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,660
No, don't tear it.

229
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,940
I will. I'll do it myself.

230
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,900
I'll do it myself.

231
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,860
No, no, no.

232
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,580
Then you need my help.

233
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,220
Tell me more.

234
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,980
Thank you, aunt.

235
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,220
By the way, Jinxia.

236
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,860
I came to tell you

237
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,500
that we should go to the old house tomorrow.

238
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,580
We haven't been back for so many years.

239
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,740
I don't know what it's like now.

240
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,860
Okay.

241
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,020
Then you should rest early.

242
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,140
Don't hurt your eyes.

243
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,260
Okay.

244
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,300
Jinxia.

245
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,740
For your sake,

246
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,780
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,420
I can only choose to hurt you.

248
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,140
Jinxia.

249
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,660
Jinxia.

250
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,060
Jinxia.

251
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,660
Jinxia.

252
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,260
Jinxia.

253
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
Jinxia.

254
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,260
Jinxia.

255
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,260
Jinxia.

256
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
Jinxia.

257
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Jinxia.

258
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Jinxia.

259
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Jinxia.

260
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Jinxia.

261
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Jinxia.

262
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Jinxia.

263
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Jinxia.

264
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
Jinxia.

265
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
Jinxia.

266
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,260
Jinxia.

267
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Jinxia.

268
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Jinxia.

269
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Jinxia.

270
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Jinxia.

271
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Jinxia.

272
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Jinxia.

273
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,260
Jinxia.

274
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Jinxia.

275
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Jinxia.

276
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Jinxia.

277
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Jinxia.

278
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,060
Heavens, Shadow, Earth.

279
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,940
Here is your western gr Tournique.

280
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,880
I like this place.

281
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,880
You'll find me very interested.

282
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,980
Scared?

283
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,580
Found you.

284
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,180
to remove their strongest stone ball.

285
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,220
Really?

286
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,420
I can't remember anything.

287
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,500
Let's go.

288
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,700
Let's go inside.

289
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,660
Xia Er.

290
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,660
Come here.

291
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,580
Good job.

292
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
Good job.

293
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,460
Good job.

294
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,380
Left.

295
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,860
Right.

296
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,860
Good.

297
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,740
Jin Xia.

298
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,340
Jin Xia.

299
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,300
Jin Xia.

300
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,060
I dreamt of a little girl

301
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,740
and an old man dancing.

302
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,180
This old man is my grandfather.

303
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,860
You remember it?

304
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,380
The past

305
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,980
seems to have happened yesterday.

306
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,860
But it's all gone.

307
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,260
Aunt.

308
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,380
I don't remember many stories.

309
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,220
I don't have a deep impression of them.

310
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,580
But as the only blood of the Xia family,

311
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,180
I will take the responsibility for the family.

312
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,580
You have this heart.

313
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,500
If your parents know it,

314
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,260
they will be very happy.

315
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,060
Let's go back first.

316
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,420
Go.

317
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,180
Let's go.

318
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,460
Mr. Nan,

319
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,300
I have a news.

320
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,140
What is it?

321
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,660
I've got the變It's the girl that Lin Lin found.

322
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,140
Who is residence of Lin Lin?

323
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,500
She is the most familiar one.

324
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,540
Yuan Jin Xia.

325
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,260
Impossible.

326
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,420
Wow.

327
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,060
Really interesting.

328
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,020
这个是一份心意 Inside客气

329
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,660
I once thought

330
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,200
we would be half a lifetime together.

331
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,140
What kind of woman is Shen'er's daughter?

332
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,660
I never thought it would be you.

333
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,740
Why are you the granddaughter of the Xia family?

334
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,860
Come on.

335
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,260
Wait for me.

336
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,700
Come here.

337
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,100
Be careful.

338
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,540
Go inside.

339
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,700
It's all destiny.

340
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Right now,

341
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,820
Lu family would give you an answer.

342
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,020
You have a weak pulse, and you have too much liver

343
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,620
You shouldn't be angry

344
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,020
I'll prescribe some medicine for you

345
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,620
Take it on time

346
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,420
You don't have to hide it from me

347
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,020
Tell me the truth

348
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,820
How long can I stay in this situation?

349
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Well

350
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,820
Is it March or May?

351
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Or one year and a half?

352
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,820
Sir, you'll get better if you take the medicine on time

353
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,820
I hope I can survive the year

354
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Take the doctor

355
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Yes, sir

356
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
Please

357
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,820
You'll recover soon

358
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Please

359
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
Don't worry, sir

360
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
You'll be fine

361
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
Life and death are predestined

362
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,820
Since I became the imperial guard, I've been living a different life

363
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Now I can only trust Yi'er

364
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,820
She is young and affectionate

365
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm afraid she will be stubborn

366
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,820
If something happens to her

367
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,820
I can't explain to her

368
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,820
Young master, you are seriously ill

369
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,820
You'll recover soon

370
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,820
She hasn't come back yet?

371
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,820
The governor said she will deal with official affairs in Beizhen Prefecture

372
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
You may leave

373
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
Yes, sir

374
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,820
Sir

375
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Sir

376
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,820
Sir

377
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,820
You haven't slept for a night?

378
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,820
The governor is worried about you

379
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,820
He...

380
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
Dad

381
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,820
You need to rest

382
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
I know

383
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Dad, why are you here so early?

384
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
His Majesty told me something

385
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
I need to keep an eye on him

386
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,820
Dad, are you okay?

387
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,820
I'm fine

388
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,820
Governor, bad news

389
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,820
The Star-picking Pavilion collapsed

390
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,820
His Majesty ordered you to go there

391
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
The Star-picking Pavilion collapsed?

392
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
I'll go to the city hall

393
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Yes, sir

394
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,820
Tell me

395
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,820
What happened?

396
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,820
The palace has been in a bad shape

397
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
The pavilion collapsed

398
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,820
If it's finished

399
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
I'll go there

400
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
I'll die

401
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Please calm down

402
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
The rain keeps pouring

403
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
The ground is not stable

404
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,820
The four states haven't been strengthened

405
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,820
That's why the pavilion collapsed

406
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,820
When the rain stops

407
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
I'll ask them to be strengthened

408
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
It will be stable like Mount Tai

409
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
I'll ask them to be strengthened

410
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
It will be stable like Mount Tai

411
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,820
Please don't worry

412
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,820
Nothing like this will happen

413
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
You mean the heaven

414
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,820
doesn't want me to repair the Star-picking Pavilion?

415
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
I dare not

416
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,820
Please calm down

417
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
It's my fault

418
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,820
Please punish me

419
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,820
You need to repair the Star-picking Pavilion

420
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,820
within a month

421
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,820
If anything goes wrong

422
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,820
You, the left minister of the Ministry of Works

423
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
can go home now

424
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,820
Yes, sir

425
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,820
Your Majesty, Commander Lu requests to see you

426
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Let him in

427
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Your Majesty

428
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
You can leave

429
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
I'll leave

430
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,820
All right, get up

431
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,820
Thank you, Your Majesty

432
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Lu Aiqing, have you heard about the Star-picking Pavilion?

433
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
I just heard that

434
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,820
I've sent my son to investigate

435
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
Yan Shifan said

436
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,820
the rain caused the pavilion to collapse

437
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,820
What do you think about it?

438
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
It's all of a sudden

439
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,820
We can only conclude after a thorough investigation

440
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
I don't believe it

441
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
How much rain

442
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,820
has destroyed the pavilion?

443
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
Our palace is flooded

444
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,820
The Ministry of Works is not focused

445
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,820
It's not a day or two

446
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
Normally

447
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,820
we can just close our eyes

448
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
But now

449
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,820
it's all on me

450
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Lu Aiqing

451
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,820
send someone to investigate

452
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,820
the real reason of the collapse

453
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
and

454
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
find out

455
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,820
Where is the money from the Ministry of Works?

456
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Investigate it

457
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,820
and report it to me in time

458
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Yes, sir

459
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
Remember

460
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,820
not to reveal anything

461
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,820
Yes, sir

462
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Hurry

463
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,820
Be careful

464
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Be careful

465
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Wait

466
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Sir

467
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,820
These materials

468
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,820
were all wasted because the Star-picking Pavilion collapsed

469
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Yes, sir

470
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
Where are you going?

471
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,820
We are going to throw them out of the theater

472
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,820
Throw them out?

473
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,820
The materials are new

474
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,820
Why do we throw them out?

475
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
You don't know

476
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,820
We can't use the wood we used once

477
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
Not to mention the rain

478
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,820
It's not strong or sharp

479
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
Sir, is there any problem?

480
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
It's okay

481
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Let's go

482
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
Yes, sir

483
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
Go

484
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
Hurry

485
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
Lu

486
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
You are late

487
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
You know

488
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,820
it's not easy to get a job in the daytime

489
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,820
It's okay

490
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
By the way

491
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,820
You know about the Star-picking Pavilion

492
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,820
It's so important

493
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
How can I not know?

494
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
I have checked it

495
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
They said the rain

496
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
broke the Pavilion

497
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
I thought about it

498
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,820
If the rain broke the Pavilion

499
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,820
the first one to repair the Pavilion

500
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
should be the Pavilion

501
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,820
Why did they rush

502
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,820
to transport the materials out of the palace?

503
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Yes

504
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,820
The emperor asked me to ask

505
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,820
He didn't order the Ministry of Works to do it

506
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Instead, he asked me to let him know

507
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,820
In this way

508
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,820
The emperor has doubts about this

509
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
What did you say?

510
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
What can I say?

511
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,820
I said

512
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,820
the Star-picking Pavilion is not open recently

513
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,820
I have to wait until the night is over

514
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,820
So I asked you out

515
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
I want to ask you

516
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,820
How can I tell the emperor about this?

517
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Since this is related to the Ministry of Works

518
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,820
It may be a chance

519
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,820
There must be something wrong with the materials

520
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,820
I can't let the Ministry of Works

521
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,820
be involved in this

522
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
If the emperor asks you again

523
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
you can tell him the truth

524
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
OK

525
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,820
If others know

526
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,820
behind me

527
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
there is a person like you

528
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Jiang Ziya who is so lucky

529
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,820
I will be in trouble

530
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Hurry up

531
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,820
It's too late

532
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
Senior sister, have you checked the dock?

533
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,820
The goods and materials are almost full

534
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
This order

535
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
is almost as much as

536
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
the two or three orders we usually receive

537
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
It's really a lot

538
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
The more goods there are

539
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,820
the more troublesome the inspection is

540
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
The more important the task of guarding the goods is

541
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Do you forget last time we sent the official silver

542
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
to Zhou Xianyi for the last time?

543
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
We were very careful

544
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
But in the end, something went wrong

545
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
We didn't lose the official silver

546
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
It's not up to us

547
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
You think it's easy

548
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
If it wasn't for the official silver

549
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
that Mr. Lu and Jin Xia found

550
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
we would still have to take the credit

551
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,820
OK

552
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
We will check it this time

553
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
There will be no mistake

554
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,820
Don't worry

555
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
When do we set off?

556
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
Tomorrow morning

557
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Go

558
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,820
Why did you bring the medicine?

559
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,820
Father, why are you still not feeling well?

560
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Do you want to see a doctor?

561
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
The disease is like a mountain

562
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
The disease is like a silk

563
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
How can we just say it's good?

564
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Sir

565
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,820
Zeng Feng, you go in first

566
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,820
Yes

567
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,820
You haven't come to see me recently

568
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,820
Are you too busy?

569
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,820
I'm not busy

570
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,820
I'm just a little busy

571
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,820
I'm just a little busy

572
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,820
I'm just a little busy

573
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
I'm just a little busy

574
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
I'm just a little busy

575
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,820
I'm just a little busy

576
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
What do you want from me?

577
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Sir, you're in a bad mood today

578
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,820
It's okay, I brought something for you

579
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,820
This is the handkerchief I embroidered

580
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,820
For you

581
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
My first time sewing it

582
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
may be a little ugly

583
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
Don't be angry

584
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
You want me to keep

585
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
wearing such ugly handkerchiefs?

586
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
Sir

587
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
I don't have time to accompany you now

588
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
If there's nothing else, I'll go first

589
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
Wait, sir

590
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
What's wrong with you today?

591
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Why do you treat me like this?

592
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
I want to know

593
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
That's good

594
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
I'll make it clear to you today

595
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,820
In case you come and bother me again

596
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
You should know

597
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
what your identity is

598
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,820
With your identity

599
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,820
How can I take you to see my father?

600
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,820
Identity

601
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Identity

602
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
Our family is innocent

603
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,820
If the news of our relationship

604
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
is spread

605
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Your identity will be exposed

606
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
It will be a shame for our family

607
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Sir, you really think so?

608
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Your Lu family has been in the military for generations

609
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
But my family

610
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,820
is just a house of tofu in the city

611
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,820
I want to marry you

612
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
What does it have to do with these things?

613
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
Our identity is out of date

614
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
Even if you agree

615
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
Your father won't agree

616
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
I, Lu Yi

617
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,820
The only woman I want to marry in this life

618
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,820
is you

619
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,820
Yuan Jin Xiang

620
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
I thought

621
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
you were different from others

622
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
I thought

623
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Our relationship is very strong

624
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,820
Jin Xiang's character

625
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,820
I don't think he will hate you

626
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
He won't even blame you

627
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
In the end

628
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,820
You can only blame the sky and the earth

629
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
and yourself

630
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
I understand

631
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
My heart is a wrong place

632
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,820
Jin Xiang

633
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,820
Forgive me

634
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
I don't want to hurt your heart

635
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
But

636
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
To protect you better

637
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,820
I really have to do this

638
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
I understand

639
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,820
My heart is a wrong place

640
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
Almost done

641
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,820
Stop

642
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
Stop

643
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
I'm coming

644
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Give me two more cups of wine

645
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
Don't

646
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Don't drink anymore

647
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,820
You've already drank a catty

648
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,820
Isn't there more?

649
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Black sheep

650
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,820
Don't stop me

651
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
Go up the bridge

652
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Okay

653
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
Da Yang

654
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,820
I'm so self-conscious

655
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,820
How can I

656
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
think of the sky

657
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,820
After I was born

658
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
Can we still be together?

659
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,820
No

660
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
I thought I didn't even think about it

661
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,820
Then

662
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Now

663
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
Is there really no room for me to go back?

664
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,820
Yes

665
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,820
This Lu Daren

666
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,820
Always self-conscious

667
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,820
I thought he wouldn't mind

668
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,820
He always said

669
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,820
I don't look like a girl

670
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Today, I'm going to eat a lot

671
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Drink a lot

672
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
Stood up high

673
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,820
Don't fall

674
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,180
What if I fall?

675
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,380
There's an adult in the world!

676
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Jin Xia.

677
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Lord Lu.

678
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,700
Why is it you?

679
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,500
You'd better think it through before you do anything.

680
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,940
Do you know how much trouble you've caused me

681
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,220
by acting so rashly?

682
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
Even if I fall trained,

683
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,500
I'll never find my ownang nacionality.

684
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,000
But I can.

685
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,320
Lord Lu,

686
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,920
I run into Mr. Lu today and I've got angry by him.

687
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,700
Just the double of vehicle?

688
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,780
So embarrassing.

689
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,260
You.

690
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,580
I don't have an adult anymore.

691
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,460
I don't have an adult anymore.

692
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,460
All right, all right.

693
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Brother.

694
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
That's right.

695
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,420
The Lu family is a minister of the court.

696
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,420
How could I not see you?

697
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,060
You've never been a good drinker since you were a child.

698
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,460
I've never seen you drink so much.

699
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,700
No matter what happens,

700
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,900
you can't ignore your health.

701
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,940
I'm fine. I can drink.

702
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,220
No way.

703
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
Ba-Yang.

704
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,420
Please.

705
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,820
Just let me drink.

706
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,380
When I'm drunk,

707
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,500
I can forget him.

708
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,940
All right, then let's make a deal.

709
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,260
When you're drunk,

710
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,740
you must forget him.

711
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,420
Then you drink.

712
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,900
When you're drunk,

713
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,420
I'll carry you back.

714
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,020
Waiter.

715
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,540
Where's our wine? Why isn't it here yet?

716
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,700
Wait a moment, sir. I'll be right back.

717
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
You drink.

718
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
All right.

719
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
It's so nice to have you, Da Yao.

720
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Cheers.

721
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,540
Cheers.

722
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
Here.

723
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Here.

724
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
Auntie.

725
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
What's wrong?

726
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Well, I'm drunk.

727
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Why are you drunk?

728
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,740
You're a girl.

729
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,740
Come in.

730
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,660
Come on.

731
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
She's in a bad mood.

732
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,660
So I drank more.

733
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,500
If she's in a bad mood, drink more.

734
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
I'm not drunk.

735
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
I'm not drunk.

736
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
I'm not drunk.

737
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
I'm not drunk.

738
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
I'm not drunk.

739
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
I'm not drunk.

740
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
I'm not drunk.

741
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
I'm not drunk.

742
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
I'm not drunk.

743
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
You're drunk because you're in a bad mood?

744
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Someone carried you back.

745
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
If no one carried you back,

746
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
you'd be in a river.

747
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Yes.

748
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
I've made it clear to you today.

749
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
In case you'll bother me again.

750
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
You should know your identity.

751
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
With your identity,

752
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
how can I take you to see my father?

753
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Jin Xia.

754
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Auntie.

755
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,500
Here.

756
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Drink the soup.

757
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Don't drink so much in the future.

758
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
It'll hurt your health.

759
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,500
This wine can remove the sorrow.

760
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
But after you sober up,

761
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
the sorrow still exists.

762
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
And it's deeper.

763
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Dayang told me yesterday

764
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
that you're unhappy because of Mr. Lu.

765
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,500
I wanted to drink more.

766
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
So I could forget him.

767
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Forget what he said.

768
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
But I can't forget it.

769
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Auntie.

770
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Auntie.

771
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Can you make me

772
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
the soup of forgetfulness?

773
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I can make you the soup of sobering up.

774
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
But I can't make the soup of forgetfulness.

775
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
You have to make the soup of forgetfulness.

776
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,500
Jin Xia.

777
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
I've seen you two

778
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
all the way here.

779
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Is there any misunderstanding?

780
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Or you can talk to him.

781
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,500
Nothing to talk about.

782
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
I'm sorry.

783
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
I'm sorry.

784
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm sorry.

785
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
I'm sorry.

786
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
I'm sorry.

787
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
I'm sorry.

788
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
I'm sorry.

789
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
I'm sorry.

790
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
I'm sorry.

791
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
I'm sorry.

792
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
I'm sorry.

793
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
I'm sorry.

794
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
I'm sorry.

795
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
I'm sorry.

796
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I'm sorry.

797
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,500
I'm sorry.

798
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,500
I'm sorry.

799
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
I'm sorry.

800
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I'm sorry.

801
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
I want to go to school.

802
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
What did you eat?

803
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,360
is like a piece of gold,

804
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,500
podcasts

805
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,940
that you wrote

806
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,800
in the sky

807
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,680
are all those years

808
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,100
we spent together

809
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,560
as we look back

810
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,540
for thousands of years
