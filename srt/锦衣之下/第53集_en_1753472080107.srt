to crush our ethic

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,980
someday.

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,020
Congratulations, Master Yang.

54
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,420
Congratulations, Mr. Lu

55
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,340
What's the good news?

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,500
Lu Ting is dead

57
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,780
We just heard about it

58
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,060
We came to congratulate you

59
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,020
I knew it

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,220
I was drinking it

61
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,420
Mr. Lu, Lu Ting is dead

62
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,900
You have no opponent in the capital

63
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,220
But Lu Yi is against you

64
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,780
He even caught you

65
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,500
Lu Ting is dead

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,300
You should kill him

67
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,300
There is another person

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,420
Who?

69
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,220
Lan Qingxuan

70
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,140
Lan Shenxuan

71
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,020
Now the emperor loves her

72
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,260
I sent someone to give her a tour

73
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,420
I hope she can join us

74
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,580
But she doesn't want to go back

75
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,700
I think he is close to the emperor

76
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,900
He has a good motive

77
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,420
Mr. Lu

78
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,820
Is there someone else

79
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,380
except Xu Jing?

80
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,900
I'm not sure

81
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,260
But I can be sure

82
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,420
I hate him

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,420
What did he want?

84
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,460
I'll find someone else

85
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,300
Mr. Lu

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,140
Shoot

87
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,100
Shoot

88
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,540
You are here, expert Lan

89
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Here, help me look at this.

90
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
This is the map of Fengshui Kan.

91
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,020
North Xuanwu, South Zhuque, East Qinglongsha, West Baihu.

92
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
The so-called mountain tube, water tube.

93
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
A spoonful of water can save the life.

94
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Look, here, here and here.

95
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
There are three water holes here, all on the lake.

96
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
And they are all water of love.

97
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
They are all things of wealth.

98
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,020
There is a royal aura here.

99
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
Where did you get this?

100
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
My father gave it to me before he passed away.

101
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,020
He said Yan Shifan built a house here.

102
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Commander is really good at the emperor.

103
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,020
He designed this map of Fengshui Kan a long time ago.

104
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
He set a trap for Yan Shifan.

105
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
I thought about it.

106
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,020
I think this thing can't be stolen for now.

107
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,020
Wait a little bit.

108
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
If you want to take down the Yan family,

109
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,020
even if there are many people in the court, it's useless.

110
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,020
You can only let the emperor lose his confidence in the Yan family.

111
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Then you can completely take down the Yan family.

112
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
It's a good idea.

113
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
But we still need to wait for the water to drop.

114
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,020
I'm afraid the Yan family won't give you time to recover.

115
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Then they will start to rebel.

116
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Just do it.

117
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
The Star-struck Temple will be completed in a few days.

118
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,020
We can take this opportunity to kill the Yan family.

119
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Okay.

120
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
I'm ready.

121
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
I'll wait for your news.

122
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Your Majesty, can you give me the thing you asked?

123
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
After I do it,

124
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,020
I will ask the immortal to come back.

125
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,020
I will answer for you.

126
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,020
The Star-struck Temple

127
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,020
The star-struck temple is still in the palace.

128
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
The sky is so beautiful.

129
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,020
How can it be a temple with a golden gate?

130
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:10,020
I've already known what you asked.

131
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,020
Greetings, immortal.

132
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,020
The world is not in a good shape.

133
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,020
It's all because of the evil minister.

134
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,020
The immortal is useless.

135
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:32,020
You were sent by heaven to save the people's wise king.

136
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Now the evil minister is blinded by double-eyes.

137
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,020
People are not at ease.

138
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,020
The court is in turmoil.

139
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,020
Your Majesty, do you know your sin?

140
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
I know my sin.

141
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Please give me the thing you asked.

142
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,020
The Star-struck Temple

143
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Yan?

144
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,020
The Star-struck Temple

145
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,020
You want to take the name of the god to my family?

146
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,020
It's ridiculous.

147
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,020
I think Lan Qingxuan thinks he is lucky.

148
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,020
You have a way.

149
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,020
The emperor is my family.

150
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
I don't believe it.

151
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,020
The skill of the axe is not leaking.

152
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Since he wants to play, I'll play with him.

153
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Master.

154
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Guards are coming.

155
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Chief Lan.

156
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
What did I do?

157
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,020
Why are you so worried?

158
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Someone pointed out that you were watching the imperial jade secretly.

159
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,020
The emperor ordered you to be interrogated in the ministry of justice.

160
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,020
In this case, I'll go with you.

161
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,020
The elixir in the elixir furnace is for the emperor.

162
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,020
Remember to send it to the emperor three hours later.

163
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,020
Yes, master.

164
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,020
The elixir furnace

165
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Master.

166
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,020
Lan Zhenren was taken away by the ministry of justice early in the morning.

167
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
What happened?

168
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
The people in the ministry of justice sent a message.

169
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,020
Did the eunuch who was on duty by the emperor report that he was watching the imperial jade secretly?

170
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,020
It seems that someone can't stand it anymore.

171
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
What do you mean?

172
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Who blocked Lan Qingxuan's way?

173
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,020
Who wants the name of Lan Qingxuan?

174
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,020
Where is the eunuch who reported Lan Qingxuan?

175
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,020
I heard that eunuch disappeared after the incident.

176
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,020
I think he was afraid of being killed.

177
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
Where is the eunuch?

178
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Did you send someone to investigate?

179
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
The emperor is addicted to the immortal method.

180
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,020
The court meetings in the palace have made the eunuch self-willed.

181
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Not to mention a little eunuch who is not related to the elixir.

182
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,020
It's over.

183
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Sir, I think it's strange.

184
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,020
I've sent someone to take back the eunuch's file.

185
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,020
But I can't do anything about it.

186
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Send more people to investigate.

187
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,020
Be sure to find that eunuch.

188
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
Yes, sir.

189
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Liu Shanming and the chase team are well known.

190
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,020
Why don't you ask Yuan Bukai to help?

191
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
No need.

192
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
Yuan Bukai.

194
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
Canfeng.

195
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,020
Why are you here?

196
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Come to find the master.

197
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,020
Is he here?

198
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,020
Yes, come with me.

199
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Come.

200
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,020
Sir, Yuan Bukai is here.

201
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,020
Qin Xia.

202
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,020
I heard that Lan Qingxuan was locked up in the prison.

203
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,020
What happened?

204
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,020
Yan Shi Fan bribed the eunuch of the Fuji clan.

205
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,020
He instigated him to frame Lan Qingxuan.

206
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,020
He was accused of deceiving the emperor.

207
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,020
It's him again.

208
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,020
I heard about the Fuji clan.

209
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Maybe it's not like Lan Qingxuan who usually speaks.

210
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,020
He always keeps half of his words.

211
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,020
And the more vague the words, the better.

212
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
How can he be so straightforward?

213
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,020
He accused the Yan family of being the eunuch.

214
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,020
He doesn't want to miss this opportunity.

215
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,020
What he did this time was the Yan family.

216
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
Yan Shi Fan will not let him go so easily.

217
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,020
If you are hard on him,

218
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,020
I'm afraid Lan will not be able to hold on.

219
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Do you have any idea?

220
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,020
We have to find that eunuch first.

221
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
Then we can save him.

222
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
The eunuch ran away?

223
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,020
The eunuch knew Yan Shi Fan would kill him.

224
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,020
So he ran away from the palace after he got the money.

225
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,020
We have to find that eunuch before Yan Shi Fan does it.

226
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Let him help Lan.

227
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
I'll go find him now.

228
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,020
Wait.

229
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Where are you going to find him?

230
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,020
I don't know.

231
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,020
Ceng Feng, take the eunuch's file and portrait to Jinxia.

232
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Yes.

233
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
You can see it first.

234
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
It's convenient for you to track him down.

235
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
What?

236
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Young Master.

237
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
How's it going?

238
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,020
Yulin Army has sealed the Linji Palace early.

239
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Lan has been sent to the prison.

240
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,020
What Lan?

241
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,020
A conman.

242
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,020
He was so kind to us because of His Majesty's favor.

243
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,020
I've told the people of the ministry of justice to take good care of him.

244
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
Be careful.

245
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
Don't kill him.

246
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
Yes.

247
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
It's hard to explain to His Majesty.

248
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
I know.

249
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,020
But Lan Qingxuan is very stubborn.

250
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,020
The ministry of justice didn't find anything out this morning.

251
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,020
A bunch of useless people.

252
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,020
Did you deal with the eunuch properly?

253
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
Not yet.

254
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,020
I was careless and let him run away.

255
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
He disappeared when I went after him.

256
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,020
But I think he won't be able to get out of the city for a long time.

257
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
He must be in the capital.

258
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Find him.

259
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,020
Only the dead can't talk.

260
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
Do you understand?

261
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,020
I understand.

262
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
Go.

263
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,020
Go to the prison with me.

264
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,020
I want to see.

265
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,020
How stubborn is this Lan?

266
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Yes.

267
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,020
See if you can do it.

268
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,020
He's so stubborn.

269
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Lord Yan.

270
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
Lord.

271
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Don't stop.

272
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Go on.

273
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Yes.

274
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
How is it? Did he confess?

275
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Replying to your words,

276
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,020
he didn't say a word since yesterday.

277
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,020
Why?

278
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Don't you know how to use force?

279
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
You don't want to?

280
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Yes.

281
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Stop.

282
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Lord Lu.

283
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
Lord Lu.

284
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
What a coincidence.

285
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Lord Lu.

286
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
His Majesty would interrogate and punish me.

287
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
I don't know why.

288
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
His Majesty merely asked to interrogate.

289
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
He didn't ask for punishment.

290
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,020
When did your Ministry of Justice become a place where you beat and punish?

291
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Lord, please forgive me.

292
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Isn't it also a punishment to beat and punish?

293
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Lord Lu.

294
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,020
You Jin Yi have so many hardships.

295
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Aren't you just trying to deal with such a stubborn person like him?

296
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,300
to see him?

297
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,820
But, Mr. Lu, don't worry.

298
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,620
He is a man of Lan clan.

299
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,140
But he is an immortal.

300
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,140
He is different from us mortals.

301
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,380
He has been washed by

302
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,900
steel and metal bones.

303
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,380
Such a normal punishment

304
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
is not

305
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,100
important to him.

306
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,180
He is a man of Lan clan that His Majesty appointed.

307
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,340
If he has a leg or two,

308
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,380
you will be killed.

309
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,100
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

310
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,740
I'll be watching you.

311
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,340
Yes.

312
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,620
Just be careful.

313
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,260
Don't kill him.

314
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,940
Just do as you should.

315
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,540
Yes.

316
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,260
Keep going.

317
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,700
This is the house of the little eunuch

318
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,180
who was bribed.

319
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,820
It seems that

320
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,380
the life of this family is not so good.

321
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,100
So much dust.

322
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm afraid that no one

323
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,180
will live in this house for a while.

324
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,300
I have to ask you a question.

325
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,380
What's the matter?

326
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,380
What's the matter?

327
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
What's the matter?

328
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
I have a question.

329
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
What's the matter?

330
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,740
The medicine is heavy on this pill.

331
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,140
It seems that he has been ill for a long time.

332
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Dayang, look.

333
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,620
This pill doesn't have any sour taste.

334
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
It's still fresh.

335
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
It means that

336
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,060
although they don't live here,

337
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,700
they often make medicine here.

338
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,900
It seems that they should be hiding nearby.

339
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,580
What should we do?

340
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,300
Let's save the life of the rabbit.

341
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,500
Since he is seriously ill now,

342
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,460
he can't run far.

343
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,620
Let's go to the nearby place

344
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,300
and see if we can find such a patient.

345
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Okay.

346
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,540
This is the master of the De Dao

347
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,260
that Yan Ge Lao

348
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,140
has found for you from all over the country.

349
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,380
I have asked His Majesty for a favor.

350
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,140
Do you want to see him?

351
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,660
No.

352
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,660
I don't want to see him.

353
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,340
You are annoying me.

354
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,580
Yes.

355
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,700
You are all the same.

356
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,620
You always give me a good advice.

357
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
Now?

358
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,500
You always make me feel embarrassed.

359
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,540
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

360
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,220
It's useless to do this.

361
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,140
It's been a few days

362
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,820
and there is no result.

363
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,660
Pass the imperial edict tomorrow.

364
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,940
Give them a ten-day sentence.

365
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

366
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,540
Get out.

367
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

368
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,140
Get out.

369
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,260
Sir.

370
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,140
Open the door.

371
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,380
Yes.

372
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,580
Here comes the seat.

373
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,140
Why are you sorry?

375
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Don't worry.

376
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,420
Don't get hurt.

377
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,540
Don't forget

378
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm the De Dao

379
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,220
who protect His Majesty.

380
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,460
The company dress

381
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,820
can flow on his body.

382
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,740
So many people

383
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,100
need it for the next generation!

384
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,780
Your Majesty.

385
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,820
I'll just take a little bit.

386
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,100
It's just...

387
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,660
It's just that

388
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,460
the fire of the Ministry of Health

389
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,660
is indeed a little bit worse.

390
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,860
When will you

391
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,660
still have the heart to joke?

392
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,060
Here.

393
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,020
This is the medicine for painkillers.

394
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,020
Take it first.

395
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,260
I'll find a way to get you out.

396
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,980
You can take a little longer.

397
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,420
Find a way to

398
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,420
let me see His Majesty.

399
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,740
See His Majesty?

400
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,340
His Majesty

401
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,980
is just listening to

402
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,780
that eunuch's speech.

403
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,060
He hasn't heard me say it.

404
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,260
As long as...

405
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,580
As long as I have a chance to see His Majesty,

406
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,460
I'll find a way.

407
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,100
It's all my fault.

408
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,340
I understand.

409
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,500
I'll try to find a way.

410
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,900
I'm here listening.

411
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,180
If anything happens,

412
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,780
I'll notify him immediately.

413
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,380
I'll go first.

414
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,140
How is Lan Zhen?

415
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,300
Your Majesty,

416
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,180
he's not well.

417
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
What do you mean?

418
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,180
When I went to announce the decree,

419
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,260
I found the imperial clan was on the run.

420
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,580
Now, Master Lan is in a mess.

421
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,180
It seems that he's only half a breath away.

422
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,300
When did he go on the run?

423
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,220
You bastard!

424
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,340
You're getting bolder and bolder!

425
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,620
Tell him

426
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,900
to kill him if he dares to go on the run!

427
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,300
I'll obey your order.

428
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,340
I'll go now.

429
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,580
Young Master,

430
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,140
Lan Qing Xuan still hasn't said anything.

431
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,580
He's stubborn.

432
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,020
Then, just hit him.

433
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,940
If you can do it,

434
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,260
don't fight with him.

435
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,620
You must find out

436
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,260
who's behind him

437
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,020
and instructing him.

438
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,940
You'll frame me

439
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,420
for the name of the imperial jade.

440
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,140
Well...

441
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,500
The news came from the palace

442
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,260
that His Majesty ordered it.

443
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,380
It's not allowed to do it.

444
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,860
I'm afraid that if we go against the imperial decree,

445
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,260
if someone finds out that we're the one who's in charge,

446
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,260
it'll be bad for Young Master.

447
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,620
Then, let's wait for someone to keep an eye on him

448
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,260
and see

449
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,220
if the mastermind behind him

450
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,940
will make any move.

451
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,740
Yes, Young Master.

452
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,940
I know that you came for Lan Qing Xuan.

453
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,180
But I recommended him to His Majesty.

454
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,580
I can't say anything for him.

455
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Otherwise, His Majesty will definitely think

456
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,380
that we're conspiring together.

457
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,620
I know.

458
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
Although His Majesty ordered

459
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,180
Yan Jin and Yan Xing to attack,

460
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,020
the Ministry of Justice is all Yan Shi Fan's people.

461
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,100
We won't let him off easily.

462
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,940
Now, I have to observe him secretly

463
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,300
and try to get a chance to see Lan Qing Xuan.

464
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,980
I'll see if there's any chance.

465
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,220
His Majesty is still angry.

466
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,380
It's really hard to see him.

467
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,820
I'm afraid that Lan Qing Xuan

468
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,620
can't last for a few days.

469
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,900
Actually,

470
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,500
we all know that

471
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,020
the best way to do this

472
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,300
is to let Lan Qing Xuan die in jail.

473
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,460
Only in this way

474
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,180
can the Yan family lose

475
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,380
the trust of His Majesty.

476
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,660
But

477
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,140
we can't let him off.

478
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,980
No.

479
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,300
I can't let him die.

480
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,620
I've sent someone to find

481
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,620
the middle official who was bribed.

482
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,420
If he can turn the tide,

483
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,420
maybe we can turn the tide.

484
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,140
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

485
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,660
If you really can't win him over,

486
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,460
don't be soft-hearted

487
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,060
and miss the good chance.

488
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,740
Lan Qing Xuan is in the line because of me.

489
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,460
I can't just watch him die.

490
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,140
I've predicted his life.

491
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,660
I've predicted his will.

492
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,540
You can't see it.

493
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,660
If you want to live, you can get what you want.

494
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,420
I believe that

495
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
since Lan Qing Xuan entered the palace,

496
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
he has figured it out.

497
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,540
He's in this situation.

498
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
He must have

499
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,460
already killed himself.

500
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,940
Take a look at this.

501
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,460
The letter of impeachment of Yan Shi Fan.

502
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,500
Lord Xu wants to use this

503
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,780
to prove Yan Shi Fan's innocence.

504
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,900
To prove

505
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,300
His Majesty's forgiveness to Lan Qing Xuan.

506
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,340
I hope it works.

507
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,580
Your Majesty,

508
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,460
I have a question.

509
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,100
Say.

510
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,220
Coram accelerate

511
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,460
of general in the Imperial Court.

512
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,120
I've arrived down б ш trash

513
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,180
The trick is wrong.

514
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,380
Kick and Baltimore Wander.

515
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,380
Please let me test the trick.

516
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,380
I ask you to show your hand

517
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,700
and show your power

518
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,820
You are a fierce subject

519
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,180
and disloyal

520
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,380
I'm sorry for my words

521
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,100
I dare to be rude

522
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,820
I repeat

523
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,620
Yan Shifan, the left minister of the Ministry of Works

524
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,140
has been hiding the truth

525
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,700
by using all his power

526
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,620
Recently, the case of the collapse of the Zhaxing Temple

527
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,140
is obviously for Yan Shaoqiong to seek personal power

528
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,540
In fact, this personal power

529
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,220
belongs to Yan Shifan

530
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,540
We're imploring Your Majesty

531
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:24,980
to lecture His Majesty

532
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,820
Your Melody

533
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
Give me the imperial edict.

534
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,660
Yes.

535
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,820
The disaster is coming.

536
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,140
Sooner or later,

537
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,820
will my family's

538
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,620
power be restored?

539
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,020
Father, don't worry.

540
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,580
His Majesty didn't

541
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,060
blame you for my fault.

542
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,540
It's just that I was too busy

543
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,660
to teach you.

544
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,260
Sometimes, His Majesty

545
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,460
would like to ask you

546
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,020
to go home.

547
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,540
But His Majesty

548
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
ordered the Three Judicial Offices

549
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,140
to judge my fault.

550
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,100
As long as His Majesty

551
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,060
doesn't forget your kindness,

552
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,260
I can leave

553
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,740
and save His Majesty's face.

554
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,700
What do you want to do?

555
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,340
Go to your master's room with us.

556
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,900
Father.

557
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Please

558
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,940
keep me company in the acting.

559
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,980
Laurel.

560
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,140
Head constable Yan,

561
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,140
Don't hurt yourself.

562
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,140
His Majesty is angry.

563
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,140
Please say a few words to His Majesty.

564
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I, Xie Zi, am here to apologize.

565
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,140
Yan Ge, His Majesty is not here today.

566
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,140
If there's anything, just write a memorial.

567
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
Your...

568
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
Your...

569
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Seeing you like this, His Majesty won't see us today.

570
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Since he used the Bitter-meat Skill,

571
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
it's better to be more careful.

572
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,140
I don't believe His Majesty will be indifferent to it.

573
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Okay.

574
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
Your Majesty!

575
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,140
I've been an official for ten years.

576
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,140
Your Majesty, I'm sorry for not being able to tell you.

577
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,140
Your Majesty!

578
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
Your father died suddenly.

579
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,140
And I put him in jail.

580
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Now I don't even have anyone to talk to.

581
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,140
I'm glad that Lu Ting has a son like you.

582
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,140
You can still hear me talk here.

583
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,140
I'm willing to share your burden.

584
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Everyone envies me for being above the top.

585
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,140
But who knows the reason for being so high?

586
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,140
I know that the Yan family has been doing things

587
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,140
that they've been doing for years.

588
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,140
The reason why I keep praising them

589
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,140
is because they're loyal to me.

590
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,140
Every time I teach them something,

591
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,140
they can do it beautifully.

592
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,140
This makes me feel relieved.

593
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,140
Those so-called loyal officials and officers

594
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,140
will see me with their own eyes.

595
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
I'm under their control.

596
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,140
I'm their puppet.

597
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,140
What else can I say?

598
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Look outside.

599
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,140
It's so cold and snowing.

600
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,140
Yan Song is still young.

601
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,140
He's even pleading for his son.

602
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,140
How can I be so cruel to him?

603
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Your Majesty, it's the people's good fortune.

604
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,140
But I'm afraid that Yan Song's bad reputation

605
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,140
will hurt His Majesty's reputation.

606
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,140
You speak more eloquently than your father.

607
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,140
You're not afraid of offending people

608
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,140
even if you don't follow the way of loyal officials?

609
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,140
Good. Yan Shi Fan's corruption case.

610
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,140
You'll investigate it for me.

611
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
You may leave.

612
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
I'll leave.

613
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,140
Lu Yi?

615
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,140
What is he doing here?

616
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,140
Your Majesty.

617
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Your Majesty.

618
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,140
It's so cold and snowing.

619
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,620
I am guilty.

620
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,700
I am not a good son.

621
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,180
I am sorry for your father's kindness.

622
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,620
You are guilty.

623
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,540
It's not your fault.

624
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,500
Look at you.

625
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,780
You are a good son.

626
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,580
You are powerful.

627
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,500
But the more power you have,

628
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,700
the more you will be punished.

629
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,020
You are the head of the court.

630
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,340
You have been the head of the court for more than 20 years.

631
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,340
Don't you understand?

632
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,500
I am guilty.

633
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,540
And you, Yan Shifan.

634
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,940
The Ming Dynasty is a good country.

635
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,940
You are watching your father

636
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,980
kneel in the snow to plead for you.

637
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,580
You are unfilial.

638
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,980
But this can be a serious crime.

639
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,860
I am guilty.

640
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,060
I will do my best

641
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,980
to serve the country and my father.

642
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,700
Go back.

643
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,460
You can decide

644
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,980
what crime you should be punished with.

645
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,100
Your Majesty.

646
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,380
Your Majesty.

647
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,180
The empress misses her father.

648
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,420
And she obeys my bad name.

649
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,980
The?Pundits Department

650
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,500
has decided the law.

651
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,140
Father, rest assured.

652
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,980
Here come the Dowager Commonwealth Stateitet.

653
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,580
Your Majesty.

654
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
Father, don't worry.

655
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Let's go home.

656
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,580
The snow is getting heavier.

657
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Yes.

658
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,580
Hurry up.

659
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
Hurry up.

660
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,580
Yes.

661
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,580
Clean up over there.

662
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Dayou.

663
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,580
Coming.

664
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
What's the emergency?

665
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,580
I have to call everyone back.

666
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,580
Don't ask.

667
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,580
Just get back to work.

668
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,580
I heard from the superior that

669
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,580
we must clean up before the time is right.

670
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
It's not the New Year.

671
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Why do we have to clean up so cleanly?

672
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
I don't know.

673
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,580
There must be a reason.

674
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,580
Hurry up.

675
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
Clean up the yard.

676
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
Leaf.

677
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
Leaf.

678
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
Old Li.

679
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
What's wrong?

680
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
Why do we have to clean up so cleanly?

681
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Lord Yan is coming.

682
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,580
Which Lord Yan?

683
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Lord Yan of Yan Shi Fan.

684
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Isn't he under His Majesty's order

685
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
and is in prison?

686
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
Why does he come to our six gates?

687
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Such a big piece of land.

688
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
Is there any law?

689
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Stop.

690
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
Stop sweeping.

691
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
Stop wiping.

692
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,580
What are you doing?

693
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
Put that down.

694
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Don't shout.

695
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Come here.

696
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,580
Jin Xia.

697
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
I really don't know.

698
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,580
If I knew,

699
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,580
I wouldn't let you come here.

700
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,580
There's still some here.

701
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,580
Why don't you leave first?

702
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,580
If the superior asks,

703
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,580
I'll say you're not feeling well.

704
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Come here.

705
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,580
I'm fine.

706
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,580
I remember when we first entered the six gates,

707
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,580
we were determined to do good deeds and restore justice.

708
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,580
But now,

709
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
we're cleaning up the court.

710
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,580
Yan Shi Fan was ordered to go to prison.

711
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,580
The Dali Temple, the Ministry of Justice, the Imperial Court,

712
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,580
and all the officials in the court

713
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
all took him as a hostage.

714
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
What are we supposed to do?

715
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,580
What kind of thief are we?

716
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,580
My Lord.

717
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,580
How is Lan Qing Xuan?

718
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,580
According to the man who arranged it,

719
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
the man who sent the message to report,

720
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
although His Majesty ordered to ban the execution,

721
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,580
but Lan Zhen Ren was seriously injured a few days ago.

722
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,580
If he can't be treated in time,

723
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,580
I'm worried that Lan Zhen Ren won't last for a few days.

724
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,580
Where's that eunuch?

725
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Did you find him?

726
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Not yet.

727
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,580
Where's Yan Shi Fan?

728
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,580
He sent Yan Feng.

729
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
He's been investigating the eunuch's whereabouts these two days.

730
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,580
Send more men.

731
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,580
You must find him before they do.

732
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,580
Yes.

733
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,580
Hurry, go in.

734
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Come on.

735
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,580
Stand still.

736
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Lord Yan is here.

737
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
Lord Yan, it's almost time for dinner.

738
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
It's not convenient here.

739
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
There's a restaurant next to it.

740
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,580
Why don't you go to have dinner first?

741
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,580
I think it's good here.

742
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,580
Put the table and chair here for dinner.

743
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
Here?

744
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
Lord Yan, you're thinking well.

745
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
It's cold and windy.

746
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
It's good to block the wind.

747
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
You guys get ready.

748
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,580
Yes.

749
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,580
Lord Yan, please have some tea inside.

750
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
They'll come for dinner after they're prepared.

751
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
Please.

752
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
Damn it.

753
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,580
He's so arrogant.

754
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
Xia Yan, listen to me.

755
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,580
You just died.

756
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
Don't be impulsive.

757
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
He's so arrogant.

758
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Lord Yan, the meal is ready.

759
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,580
Please have a seat.

760
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Where's Yuan Jin Xia?

761
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
Why didn't I see him?

762
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
Lord Yan,

763
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,580
Jin Xia went to the city to handle the case early in the morning.

764
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,580
He had to stay up late.

765
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
So he didn't come back.

766
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Really?

767
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
Yes.

768
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,580
What a pity.

769
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Lord, please.

770
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Please.

771
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,580
Please.

772
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,580
Okay.

773
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,580
I suggest that we toast to Lord Yan.

774
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,580
Okay.

775
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,580
Lord Yan, please.

776
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,580
Lord Yan,

777
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,580
His Majesty will have three judges to review your case.

778
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,580
The result is that you've stolen 3,000 taels of silver.

779
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
What do you think, Lord?

780
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
What?

781
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
2,000 taels.

782
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
How much?

783
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
1,000 taels?

784
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
It's a bargain.

785
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Lord Yan,

786
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,580
you know that His Majesty has strict orders.

787
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,580
We have to live with it.

788
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
Don't you think so?

789
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,580
I think it's better not to be more than 1,000 taels.

790
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Then let's make it 800 taels of silver.

791
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,580
800?

792
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,580
Well...

793
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
What's wrong?

794
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,580
As you said,

795
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,580
800 taels.

796
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
Come on, cheers.

797
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,580
Okay.

798
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,580
Come on.

799
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Lord,

800
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
Eunuch Lu of the Imperial Guards wants to see you.

801
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Lord Yan,

802
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,580
if he sees us here,

803
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,580
and reports to His Majesty that we're on duty,

804
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,580
I'm afraid that His Majesty will be upset.

805
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
What are you afraid of?

806
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,580
His Majesty doesn't have enough time to rest.

807
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,580
He doesn't have time to deal with such a trifle.

808
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Let him in.

809
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,580
Yes.

810
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
You're all here.

811
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
I'm sorry.

812
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
Eunuch Lu,

813
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
you came to see me.

814
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,580
His Majesty asked me to know about Lord Yan's corruption.

815
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,580
I didn't know that Lord Yan came to the Six Forts.

816
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,580
The Six Forts is a small place.

817
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,580
There are many bars in the prison.

818
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
I thought Lord Yan wouldn't get used to it.

819
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
Now the money from the Six Forts

820
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,580
can be Lord Yan's food.

821
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
I'm really worried.

822
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,580
I'm sorry.

823
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,580
Eunuch Lu,

824
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,580
you came here on purpose.

825
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Are you worried that I'll make things difficult for you?

826
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
But you're just in time.

827
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,580
The Three Judicial Offices just convicted me.

828
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
They said that I was corrupt.

829
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
How many people?

830
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,580
The result of the trial is 800 lia.

831
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
Eunuch Lu,

832
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
you can report it to His Majesty.

833
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
It seems that you're worrying too much.

834
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:50,580
The winner is the one who has been filial to the end.

835
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,580
Lord Yan is so kind.

836
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,580
Then I won't disturb you.

837
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,580
I'll leave now.

838
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
You don't need to know many things.

839
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,580
I have to fulfill some of my wishes.

840
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Do you have no other choice

841
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,580
except to make a promise?

842
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,580
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
I'm sorry.

844
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,580
I'm sorry.

845
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,580
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,580
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,580
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,580
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,580
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,580
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,580
I'm sorry.

853
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,580
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,580
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,580
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,580
I'm sorry.

857
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,580
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,580
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,580
I'm sorry.

861
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,580
I'm sorry.

862
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,580
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,580
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,580
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,580
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,580
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,580
I'm sorry.

868
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,580
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
I'm sorry.

870
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,580
I'm sorry.

871
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,580
I'm sorry.

872
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
I'm sorry.

873
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,580
I'm sorry.

874
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,580
I'm sorry.

875
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,580
I'm sorry.

876
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,580
I'm sorry.

877
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,580
I'm sorry.

878
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,580
I'm sorry.

879
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,580
I'm sorry.

880
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
I'm sorry.

881
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,580
I'm sorry.

882
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,580
I'm sorry.

883
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,580
I'm sorry.

884
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,580
I'm sorry.

885
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,580
I'm sorry.

886
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,580
I'm sorry.

887
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
I'm sorry.

888
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,580
I'm sorry.

889
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,580
I'm sorry.

890
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
I'm sorry.

891
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,580
