Jin Xiang.

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
Jin Xiang.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Jin Xiang.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,840
Jin Xiang.

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,960
Jin Xiang.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,960
Qin Xiang.

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Qin Xiang.

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,880

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Qin Xiang.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
You're not sleeping?

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can't sleep.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's too noisy inside.

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Sir.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,600
Are you reading private letters?

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sir.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I accidentally broke the bracelet last time.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're so angry.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This bracelet must be important to you.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Which girl gave you this bracelet?

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A love token?

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a love token.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a lifetime.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
A love token?

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But it's not a love token between a man and a woman.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's a love token that's so strong that it can't be cut off.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
When I was young,

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
my mother often played the peony for me.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
One night,

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
my father came back early to play with us.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I was so happy that day.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Father.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Good boy.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Good boy.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't expect...

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Father.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Father.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mother.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mother.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mother.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mother.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mother.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Mother.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mother died.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The string is broken.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I always carry the blood of mother's blood on my body.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I take it as a souvenir.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Uncle.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't know.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's okay.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's almost dawn.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You should go back and sleep for a while.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Master.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Where did you go?

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're awake.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Come here.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I picked it up nearby.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Eat it.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Thank you.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Where are the blue-skinned man and Xie Xiao?

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Xie Xiao went to catch the wild chicken.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The blue-skinned man should have gone with him.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why are you so excited?

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Maybe it's because I ate it yesterday.

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think it's because you ate it yesterday.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why is there a horse on the roof of the cliff?

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's go and have a look.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Go.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Master, look.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We didn't see the horse.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's not a horse.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a horse.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's a horse.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Look.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We didn't hear wrong.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a horse.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why is it gone?

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's gone.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's gone.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's gone.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's gone.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's gone.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's gone.

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's gone.

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's gone.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's gone.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's gone.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's gone.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's gone.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's gone.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's gone.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's gone.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's gone.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's gone.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's gone.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's gone.

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's gone.

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's gone.

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's gone.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's gone.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's gone.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's gone.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's gone.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's gone.

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's gone.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's gone.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's gone.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's gone.

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I didn't mean to.

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I must...

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't touch it!

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
My mother died.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
My blood was broken.

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I kept carrying this blood of my mother

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
on my body.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Just take it as a souvenir.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Go!

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Go!

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Sir!

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Go!

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Go!

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Your Majesty!

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Go!

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Go!

185
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Go!

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sir.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You can't lose such an important thing.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Take it.

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't be too moved.

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Who's wish

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
makes people linger in their dreams

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and stand on the edge of eternity?

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can hear

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
your heartbeat in my ears.

195
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
In a moment,

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
we are separated by two sides,

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
searching for the eternal that will never come back.

198
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I can see

199
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
your tears falling on my heart.

200
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm afraid that

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the eyes will disappear.

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yuan Jinxia, are you crazy?

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You can still dream in such a dangerous moment?

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And you are still in love with Sir Lu.

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Xiao Fei, where is Young Master?

206
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Master, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They took my mother away.

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I...

209
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I was forced to do so.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Master.

211
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Chief, you are a good man.

212
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Chief.

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We meet again.

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Dong Qisheng?

215
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm from the Western Regions.

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This soft bone umbrella is good for your health.

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Dong's water debt has provoked me many times.

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now they want to frame me.

219
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What do you want?

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What provoking?

221
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Chief, you are too serious.

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
A few days ago,

223
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I happened to meet a Western cook.

224
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I thought that

225
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
you must have never tasted the delicacy of the Western Regions.

226
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So today,

227
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I specially invited you to my Dong's water debt.

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Let's have a taste of

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the Western cook's cooking skills

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and the Jiangnan cook's cooking skills.

231
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What's the difference?

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Invite?

233
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Is that how you invite people?

234
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Chief Shangguan is famous.

235
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm a little shy.

236
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm afraid that you will reject me.

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I thought about it before I thought about it.

238
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's how I came up with this idea.

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Please, Chief Shangguan.

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes.

241
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let's go.

242
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You really don't know?

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Or are you pretending to not know?

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why can everyone see my feelings for you?

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But you don't know it at all?

246
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Xue Xiao,

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
what should I do with you?

248
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Alone,

249
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I can't even see you.

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I can't even see you.

251
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's so hard to

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
take care of someone alone.

253
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm really worried about Shangguan.

254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, I have to go see her.

255
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Where did this horse come from?

256
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a long story.

257
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hurry up and clean up.

258
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Leave here.

259
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You have a way to go down the mountain?

260
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The pirates have already found us.

261
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And they will find us here soon.

262
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We have to leave quickly.

263
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Stop. It's the sound of the master again.

264
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm afraid that the horse is not here.

265
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm afraid that the horse is not here.

266
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not here.

267
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They're coming so fast.

268
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Those liars!

269
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Come in.

270
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Go.

271
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hurry up and enter the house.

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where is the blue swan?

273
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This rabbit is running away.

274
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This guy.

275
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why are these people coming so fast?

276
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They're so unlucky.

277
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
They're even drinking water.

278
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Today is the day of the master's death.

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then the crazy people came.

280
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This Zhu Shaosheng must have something to do with the crazy people.

281
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What is this?

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The flowers I picked for you.

283
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I know these flowers.

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm talking about the smell.

285
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
These crazy people

286
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
are using their aura to distinguish the same smell.

287
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And not their eyes.

288
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Sir.

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I know what they smell like.

290
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Stop kicking.

291
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll put it on for you.

292
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Put it on.

293
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Do it yourself.

294
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Sir.

295
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Put it on for me.

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay.

297
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's try it.

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Try it.

299
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let me do it.

300
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Give it to me.

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hey.

302
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Good.

303
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's go.

304
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's go.

305
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Sir.

306
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's go.

307
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Hurry up.

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Let me tell you.

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Today's matter is so embarrassing.

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No one is allowed to say it out.

311
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's not embarrassing.

312
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's pretty.

313
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Really?

314
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's pretty.

315
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's pretty.

316
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This way.

317
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This way.

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You liar.

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Sir.

320
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There may be some misunderstandings about the previous matter.

321
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I believe Master Lan

322
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
has already explained it to you.

323
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Master Lan has explained it to us.

324
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He has explained it to us.

325
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You are not the ones who are awake.

326
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You have offended us before.

327
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's dangerous outside.

328
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If you have anything to say,

329
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
please go back to the village with us first.

330
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Please.

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Come on.

332
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Bring me a bowl.

333
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Before,

334
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I have never treated you

335
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
with such a kind of treatment.

336
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I have offended you three.

337
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I am here to apologize to you three.

338
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Come on.

339
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Cheers.

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Cheers.

341
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Cheers.

342
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Cheers.

343
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Fill it up.

344
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Good wine.

345
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Lan...

346
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Where is Master Lan?

347
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Go and ask them to serve the dishes.

348
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes.

349
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yes.

350
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Master Lan is not feeling well.

351
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
He is resting in the backyard.

352
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Come on.

353
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Fill it up.

354
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Come on.

355
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's continue drinking.

356
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Come on.

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Cheers.

358
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Come on.

359
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Come on.

360
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Come on.

361
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Not bad.

362
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Is this wine okay?

363
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Come on.

364
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Fill it up.

365
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Drink more.

366
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Come on.

367
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Come on.

368
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Cheers.

369
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Cheers.

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Is this wine okay?

371
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Didn't you know what this wine was supposed to taste like?

372
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,520
Next one please.

373
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Thank you.

374
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Come on.

375
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Cheers.

376
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Regent.

377
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Look.

378
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
a small last success garden that is only two months old.

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You peel the•

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,440
Dong Xisheng, what do you want?

382
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,440
I just want to have a meal with Chief Shangguan.

383
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,160
Fine.

384
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,760
Give me the antidote first.

385
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,400
No.

386
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,760
Are you feeling weak now?

387
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,920
Come on.

388
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,440
I'll feed you.

389
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,240
Give me all the antidotes.

390
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,040
No, you can't!

391
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,160
Shangguan Xi.

392
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
Don't just drink withoutnonce.

393
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Hurry up!

394
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Go!

395
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Hurry up! Kneel!

396
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Kneel!

397
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Kneel!

398
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Kneel!

399
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Xiao Fei!

400
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Kneel!

401
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
You subordinate

402
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
clearly did something to betray

403
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
but you still wanted to report it.

404
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
What a joke.

405
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Hall Leader!

406
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
I'm sorry!

407
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Dong Qisheng,

408
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
let them go.

409
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
You're not just a Hall Leader

410
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
but also a Hall Leader.

411
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
The whole Dong's Water Town

412
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
is under your command.

413
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
You're so beautiful.

414
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Then let's see

415
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,640
if I'm beautiful or not.

416
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Look.

417
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
If you don't behave,

418
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,640
I'll torture them little by little.

419
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
I'd like to see

420
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
how well you,

421
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
the Hall Leader of the Wu'an Sect,

422
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
can endure

423
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
for your brothers.

424
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
You!

425
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Hit harder!

426
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Come and see.

427
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Come on!

428
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
You!

429
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Take this beauty

430
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
to the warehouse.

431
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Go!

432
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
Miss Shangguan, go!

433
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
You came to Dong's Water Town

434
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
as you wanted

435
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
and left as you wanted?

436
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
You!

437
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Slow down, Miss Yuan.

438
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
It's so good that you fell down.

439
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Don't fall.

440
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
We're here, Miss Yuan.

441
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
You'll stay here tonight.

442
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Come on, let's go upstairs.

443
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Thank you.

444
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
Be careful.

445
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Be careful.

446
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Watch your feet.

447
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
I'll stay here.

448
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
I drank too much.

450
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
I want to vomit.

451
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Are you okay?

452
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
I want to vomit.

453
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
You drank too much.

454
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
I want to sleep.

455
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Go to sleep.

456
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
I won't disturb you.

457
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Slow down.

458
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
You should go to sleep too.

459
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Okay.

460
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Slow down.

461
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
You're so stupid.

462
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Why did you come alone?

463
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
I went to the Wu'an Gang to find you.

464
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
On the way, I saw Xiao Fei

465
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
being caught by a group of people

466
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
and followed me.

467
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
I saw you being humiliated

468
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
and rushed to save me.

469
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
I didn't expect to go to the emergency room.

470
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
I was so worried.

471
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
I was worried about you.

472
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
I'm sorry.

473
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
I'm sorry.

474
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
I'm sorry.

475
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,640
I'm sorry.

477
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
I'm sorry.

480
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
I'm sorry.

481
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
I'm sorry.

482
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
I'm sorry.

483
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
What kind of syndrome is this?

488
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:47,820
Can't you API Geography the six individual

489
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
I really envy Xie Xiao.

490
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,820
Someone misses him every day.

491
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
What's going on?

492
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,900
Why are you still here?

493
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
I just wanted to ask you something.

494
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Let's go out for a night out.

495
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
Okay, let's go.

496
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Let's go.

497
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
Let's go.

498
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Let's go.

499
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Let's go.

500
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
Let's go.

501
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
Let's go.

502
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
Let's go.

503
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Let's go.

504
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
Let's go.

505
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Let's go.

506
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
Let's go.

507
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
You're so fast.

508
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,900
How can you be so easy to catch?

509
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
No, I'm not.

510
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,900
I was running away to save you.

511
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Really?

512
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,900
I told him I've told the gods.

513
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,900
If I want to save the village, I have to bring you back.

514
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
So he came to save us.

515
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
You think so?

516
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
They'll take someone to save you.

517
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Can you help me up?

518
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
I'm tired.

519
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
But I'm the one who said that.

520
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
I told him you're the officials.

521
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Let them fix the ladder and let you out.

522
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Are you afraid that they'll know you're a fraud?

523
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
They'll beat you up.

524
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
So they made us do it.

525
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
You're a liar.

526
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
You should tell the truth.

527
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,900
Don't blame him.

528
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,900
If I didn't say that, he wouldn't have saved you.

529
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,900
We're safe and sound.

530
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Stop bragging.

531
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
How did you get out?

532
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
I have my own way.

533
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
What way?

534
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
I won't tell you.

535
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
The crisis is right in front of us.

536
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,900
I suggest you don't sell the restaurant.

537
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
What crisis?

538
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:31,340
Help me to send the

539
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
The point is...

540
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,900
The point is...

541
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,900
He just agreed to tie me up.

542
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,900
If I'm right, he wants to suppress Chen Jing.

543
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,900
Chen Jing?

544
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
What do you mean?

545
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Prime Minister Yuan.

546
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
I have a plan.

547
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
What is it?

548
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
You should go back.

549
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
I'm tired.

550
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
You should go back.

551
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
I have to go back.

552
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
You can go back now.

553
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm tired.

554
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
You can go back.

555
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
I'm tired.

556
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,900
You can go back.

557
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
You can go back.

558
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I'm tired.

559
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
I'm tired.

560
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,380
Boss, we've seen both theyático.

561
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,540
I'm leaving.

562
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,100
My people.

563
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,700
The other two are gone.

564
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,500
Go find them.

565
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Yes.

566
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,500
He's scary. He eats people.

567
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,300
So every three years, they will give this dragon a living person.

568
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,900
What? Then hurry and tell the police. You liar!

569
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,300
What kind of joke is that?

570
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,900
If I tell them now, they won't believe anything I say.

571
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,300
They will only think that you are the one who is bullying me.

572
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,700
Liar. You damn liar.

573
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,500
I will take care of you later.

574
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,100
No, no, no. Miss, do you have time to untie me first?

575
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,700
Where is he?

576
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,300
I am already stupid.

577
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Sun Dong Tou has a pond. There is a well in it.

578
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,700
Every three years, they will give this dragon a living person.

579
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,500
Oh no. Let's take a step back.

580
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,700
Sir!

581
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Xie Xing! Are you all in there?

582
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
I am here.

583
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
I am here.

584
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
I am here.

585
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Sir, is that you?

586
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Sir!

587
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,500
I don't care. Let's go down and take a look.

588
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Let's go.

589
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,100
That's great. You didn't die.

590
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,500
The girl saved you two?

591
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
What's the matter?

592
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
When I first came to this village

593
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
I discovered a ancestral hall

594
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
There is a ancient well inside

595
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
The Shi clan

596
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
has been protecting this well for generations

597
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
I accidentally broke into this place

598
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I was just passing by

599
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Sir, don't be afraid

600
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Don't be afraid

601
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Who?

602
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Who is laughing?

603
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Don't pretend to be a ghost

604
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
I'm not afraid

605
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
I'm not afraid

606
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Come here

607
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
What's going on? Who are you?

608
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
I'm the next leader of Long Bai village

609
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Who are you?

610
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
How did you get into our village?

611
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
And our ancestral hall

612
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Little rabbit

613
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
You are a human being

614
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Why are you pretending to be a ghost?

615
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm asking you

616
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
You didn't answer me

617
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Why should I answer you?

618
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Okay

619
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
You are the next leader, right?

620
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
I'm the leader

621
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
who is going to spend a lot of money

622
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
to invite you

623
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
My name is Lan Qing Xuan

624
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Okay, it's your turn

625
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
What are you hiding in the well?

626
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
I'm looking for a dragon

627
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Wait

628
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
What dragon?

629
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
There is a dragon in the well

630
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
My father said there is

631
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
But I haven't seen it

632
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
It's too deep

633
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
I climbed up every time I couldn't get to the bottom

634
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
I climbed up

635
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
You liar

636
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Your father was afraid you would run around

637
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
and scare you

638
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
My father said

639
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Two thousand years ago

640
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
There was a dragon

641
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
that was in the well

642
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
It killed many people

643
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
At that time, the king of Chu sent some sorcerers

644
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
to conquer the dragon

645
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Ten ancestors

646
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Ten people

647
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
have lived here for more than two thousand years

648
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
to guard this dragon

649
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
My father said

650
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Every three years, we have to offer a living person to the dragon

651
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Anyway, the situation

652
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
is probably like this

653
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
I didn't mean it

654
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I didn't expect things to develop to this situation

655
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
You tell Jin Xia

656
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
I'm sorry

657
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Why are you all like this?

658
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Can't you help me get rid of the treasure first?

659
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Jin Xia

660
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Jin Xia

661
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Jin Xia

662
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Combine them

663
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
One, two, three, four

664
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
It's a story, right?

665
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
This painting has a spiritual power

666
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
and rough style

667
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
It doesn't look like a thing from the Jin Dynasty

668
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
It looks

669
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
pretty valuable

670
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Go, go, go

671
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
What are you thinking?

672
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Find someone to pick up

673
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Where did Mr. Lu and Xie Xiao

674
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
go?

675
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
There is no letter on the left side of the dragon hand

676
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
This is the only one

677
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
There must be something strange

678
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Mr. Lu

679
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Xie Xiao

680
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Xie Xiao

681
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Xie Xiao

682
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Mr. Lu

683
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Xie Xiao

684
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Mr. Lu

685
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Xie Xiao

686
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Mr. Lu

687
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Mr. Lu

688
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
The skull is blackened

689
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
This is bad luck, but it died from poisoning

690
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
It seems that the little master has to be careful

691
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Mr. Lu

692
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Mr. Lu

693
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Mr. Lu

694
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Mr. Lu

695
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Mr. Lu

696
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Mr. Lu

697
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Mr. Lu

698
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Mr. Lu

699
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Mr. Lu

700
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Mr. Lu

701
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Mr. Lu

702
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Mr. Lu

703
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Mr. Lu

704
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Mr. Lu

705
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Mr. Lu

706
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Mr. Lu

707
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
Mr. Lu

708
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Mr. Lu

709
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Mr. Lu

710
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Mr. Lu

711
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Mr. Lu

712
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
Mr. Lu

713
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Mr. Lu

714
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Mr. Lu

715
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Mr. Lu

716
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
Mr. Lu

717
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Mr. Lu

718
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Mr. Lu

719
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
Mr. Lu

720
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Mr. Lu

721
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Mr. Lu

722
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Mr. Lu

723
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Who is it?

724
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Don't be a monster

725
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Come out

726
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,500
I can see your face when I close my eyes.

727
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,500
When I open my eyes, I can see the cold in the back.

728
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,500
The sword is full of sweet.

729
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,500
In the mortal world, who has conquered?

730
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,500
The sound of the dance, the sound of the flute,

731
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,500
the sound of the flute, the sound of the flute,

732
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:58,500
I can see the change in the mortal world.

733
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Like farewell, farewell is too sad.

734
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,500
There is a golden leaf,

735
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:19,500
I met the day you wrote the white paper.

736
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,500
I wrote the years of our journey.

737
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:31,500
In the twinkling of an eye, a thousand words.

738
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,500
The Long Ballad

739
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Episode 1
