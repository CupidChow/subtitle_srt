Do you think that she can run away

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm not going to talk to you.

56
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,140
Don't worry.

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,140
You have the lives of all three of us.

58
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
We can't run away.

59
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
Just look at it.

60
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,140
Don't move.

61
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
Don't move.

62
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
Open it.

63
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
Otherwise, I can't see it clearly.

64
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,140
I've never studied this hand gun before.

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,140
It's changed like this.

66
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,140
It's done.

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,140
Girl, go to the prison.

68
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
Go.

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
Sir.

70
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
Go after him.

71
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Sir, go.

72
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
Go after him.

73
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
Go after him.

74
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,140
Yes.

75
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
Go.

76
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
Sir, this way.

77
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
This way.

78
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,140
Sir.

79
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
Sir.

80
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Sir.

81
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,140
Sir, come with me.

82
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Wait here and hide.

83
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Sir.

84
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
Hide here.

85
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,140
I'll lure them to you.

86
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Hide.

87
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,140
Where is he?

88
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,140
Search carefully.

89
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
Yes.

90
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Go.

91
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Go.

92
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Go.

93
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,140
Go.

94
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
There.

95
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,140
Go.

96
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
There.

97
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
Go.

98
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
Yes.

99
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Stop.

100
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,140
Stop.

101
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,140
Stop.

102
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Go after them.

103
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Hurry.

104
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
Go after them.

105
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,140
Go after them.

106
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
Yes.

107
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,140
Go after them.

108
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Stop.

109
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Stop.

110
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Sir.

111
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,140
Sir.

112
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Go.

113
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
Go after them.

114
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,140
Sir.

115
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Go.

116
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Hurry.

117
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,140
Go.

118
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
You little pigs.

119
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,140
I'm afraid you can't catch up.

120
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
Run.

121
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
Why don't you run?

122
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,140
I knew you were running in the direction of the dead end.

123
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
I've been waiting for a long time.

124
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Don't be afraid.

125
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
We'll find a way.

126
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Don't come over.

127
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,140
If you come over, we'll jump off right away.

128
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Jump off and be a pair of dead ends.

129
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
What a pity.

130
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Do you miss Jiu Lu Yi?

131
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
Yes.

132
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,140
Of course I do.

133
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,140
Give me the drawing of the other half of the hand-made painting.

134
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
I'll let you two go.

135
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,140
I didn't expect that the head of the Mao family was so persistent.

136
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,140
He actually has a strong interest in the firecracker of our Ming Dynasty.

137
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Do you want me to send you to the Shenji Camp to learn?

138
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,140
So that you can still serve our Ming Dynasty in the future.

139
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,140
At this time, you still want to negotiate with me?

140
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,140
Are you two too self-righteous?

141
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,140
You're the one who's self-righteous.

142
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,140
We knew your plan.

143
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,140
You never thought that our master could understand the bird dance.

144
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,140
Brother.

145
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,140
There's someone who's coming this way.

146
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,140
I understand.

147
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Why should I believe you?

148
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
You tricked them and got the blood.

149
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Then you killed them all.

150
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
At that time, the state of the master's poison was also a disguise.

151
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Lord Lu actually knows the Eastern English.

152
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
The Imperial Guards are really extraordinary.

153
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
I, Mao Mou Ren, like this kind of person the most.

154
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,140
How about this?

155
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,140
I can look forward to what just happened.

156
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,140
You know, I can find someone to make the pure poison.

157
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,140
I can also find someone to make the antidote.

158
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Then why didn't you say it earlier?

159
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
This is my bargaining chip.

160
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,140
Can I tell you casually?

161
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
It's true.

162
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
After all, you're the leader of the pirates.

163
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,160
You're definitely not a

164
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,140
But why do you think we'll believe you?

165
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,140
Do you have any other choices?

166
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,140
I'm afraid I'll let the head of the Mao family down.

167
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Jinxia, Jinxia.

168
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,140
Since you want to die so much, I'll give you a ride.

169
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,140
Lord, with our weight,

170
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,140
this and Tengtiao should not last long.

171
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Otherwise, otherwise you let me go.

172
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,140
With your martial arts, you may not be able to go up.

173
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,140
If you want to die, you die.

174
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,140
If you want to live, you live.

175
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,140
If you want to die, you die.

176
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,140
If you want to live, you live.

177
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
If you want to live, you live.

178
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
I can only take one more.

179
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
Believe me.

180
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Sir, we're still alive.

181
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
Are you okay?

182
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,140
I'm fine.

183
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,140
Sir, look.

184
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
They let them run away.

185
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
You guys.

186
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,140
Mao Hai Feng, the soldiers have come to arrest you.

187
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
Hurry up and stop the music.

188
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
You're lucky.

189
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Retreat.

190
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Retreat.

191
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Jinxia.

192
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Jinxia.

193
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Go to the capital.

194
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Go to the bottom of the cliff to find them.

195
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
Okay, go.

196
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
I said, are you guys tired?

197
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,140
What are you doing?

198
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
You've turned the basket dizzy.

199
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
You.

200
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
I was also mixed up back then.

201
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,140
Just you guys.

202
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
You're really not my match.

203
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
I don't know how's uncle.

204
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
Will he be caught back again?

205
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Girl.

206
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Girl.

207
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Uncle.

208
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Are you okay?

209
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
Very good.

210
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,140
You're underestimating your uncle.

211
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
Didn't I tell you?

212
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
I can handle six, seven, eight, nine.

213
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
That's all I need.

214
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Uncle, you're so good.

215
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Why don't you just beat that Japanese investment?

216
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,140
This way, we won't have to run away.

217
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
I can handle those guys.

218
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
But that cat.

219
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
Then.

220
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,140
It's already a good thing that we can get away.

221
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Don't move.

222
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,140
You just moved your inner strength, right?

223
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Hurry.

224
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,140
Let's.

225
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,140
Sit here and rest.

226
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
Come.

227
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,140
You better remember this.

228
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,140
No matter what happens.

229
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Don't move your inner strength.

230
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Or even the gods can't save you.

231
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Uncle.

232
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Didn't you say that there's a doctor who can cure the poison?

233
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
Let's go find him now.

234
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Let's go.

235
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
What's wrong?

236
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
What's wrong, uncle?

237
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Girl.

238
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Let me tell you.

239
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
There's a rule in the doctor's behavior.

240
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
The officer is not a doctor.

241
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,140
Okay.

242
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
Okay?

243
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
The officer wears a uniform.

244
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
And his waist is cut.

245
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Who can tell that he's an officer?

246
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,140
Isn't that cheating?

247
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Since the doctor has rules.

248
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,140
We won't force it.

249
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Let's go back.

250
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
No.

251
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
As long as there's a little hope.

252
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
We have to try.

253
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Officer, you rest first.

254
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Don't talk.

255
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,140
I'll do it.

256
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Uncle.

257
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
What's cheating?

258
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
Although we didn't tell them that we're officers.

259
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
But we didn't say that we're not officers.

260
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
What's cheating?

261
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Uncle.

262
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
He's your grandson.

263
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
I know.

264
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
It's a matter of life and death.

265
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
I know that too.

266
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Officer.

267
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Lu Yi.

268
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Are you okay?

269
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Lu Yi.

270
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
Are you okay?

271
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
Lu Yi.

272
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Uncle, look.

273
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,140
What's wrong with him?

274
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,140
And.

275
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,140
You're the one who made this poison.

276
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Uncle, you can't die without saving me.

277
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
Uncle.

278
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Uncle.

279
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Save him.

280
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
Okay.

281
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,140
Okay.

282
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Just do as you said.

283
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Okay?

284
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
How?

285
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
He's my grandson, right?

286
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,140
I can't die without saving him.

287
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,140
Of course not.

288
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
But we have to keep it in mind.

289
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Don't tell anyone.

290
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
If he knows that I'm cheating him.

291
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,140
Then.

292
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
Don't worry.

293
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Don't say a word.

294
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
If he's a criminal.

295
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
He'll blame me for everything.

296
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:42,200
Brother If Just Stole the

297
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,060
You Knew Is Uhm Do You

298
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,780
Although I haven't been here for many years,

299
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,540
I can still find it.

300
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,500
But it doesn't look like someone lives here.

301
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,300
That's a place for the high-ranking people.

302
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,380
How can ordinary people imagine that?

303
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,900
You're right.

304
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,340
Uncle,

305
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,980
how long have you known each other?

306
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,780
It's been

307
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
twenty years.

308
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,980
Don't tell me later that

309
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,660
I brought you here.

310
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,100
Why?

311
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,220
Do you have a grudge?

312
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,700
Because

313
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,460
it's hard to say.

314
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,260
It's all because of the debt I owed when I was young.

315
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
I won't go to see him later.

316
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,300
He'll be in trouble if I bump into him.

317
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,540
Is it because you owed him a lot?

318
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,900
You're not allowed to talk nonsense.

319
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,140
Slow down.

320
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,420
Uncle,

321
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,900
what kind of person is he?

322
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,980
He...

323
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,060
You'll know when you see him.

324
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,020
His name is Lingling.

325
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,580
You can call him Doctor Lin.

326
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,060
Sir.

327
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,380
Sir.

328
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,060
I'm fine.

329
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,180
What's wrong?

330
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,140
I'm fine.

331
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,940
Snake!

332
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,460
What should I do?

333
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,100
Wait.

334
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,180
The snake is too strange.

335
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,780
I shouldn't act rashly.

336
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,500
These snakes are all blood.

337
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,700
Don't hurt them.

338
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,500
The more blood, the more snakes.

339
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,820
What should we do now?

340
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,060
What should we do?

341
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:29,980
How about this?

342
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,300
Grab it with your hands.

343
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,060
Grab it with my hands?

344
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Is there any other way?

345
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,400
Get out.

346
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,020
Mother.

347
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,880
Mother.

348
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,040
Father.

349
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,200
Yinreng.

350
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,440
Ms.いい。

351
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,460
Sit.

352
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,460
This wine is the best osmanthus wine I brought from the capital.

353
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Try it, Boss Mao.

354
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Try it, Boss Mao.

355
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,460
This osmanthus wine is pure and sweet.

356
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
It's not like wine, but it's the best.

357
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
It's really a good wine.

358
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Boss Mao is a good drinker.

359
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
It seems that you like wine.

360
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,460
I do like wine, but I prefer beauty.

361
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,460
I heard that your osmanthus wine was destroyed by someone.

362
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Yes.

363
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,460
I accidentally made a mistake and destroyed all the osmanthus wine I cultivated.

364
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,460
It ruined all my plans.

365
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,460
So you lost a lot.

366
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,460
I must take revenge.

367
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Especially the female officer of the Six Hills School.

368
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,460
She is very cunning and hurt me with her hands.

369
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
It's not easy.

370
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
The female officer of the Six Hills School?

371
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
Greetings, Lord Yan.

372
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,460
This girl can hurt Boss Mao.

373
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Good.

374
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
Interesting.

375
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
They are not getting better.

376
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Lu Yi was poisoned by the osmanthus wine I cultivated.

377
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,460
It's hard to cure him.

378
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
He may not live for a few days.

379
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Really?

380
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Let's see if he can get through this.

381
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Lu Yi, take this jar.

382
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,460
It must be useful to you.

383
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
I tell you.

384
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Go along this path.

385
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
Go ahead.

386
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Go through this forest and you will reach the Wind Waker.

387
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Let's go.

388
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,460
I won't go.

389
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
You two go.

390
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,460
Okay.

391
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,460
Thank you.

392
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
Wait.

393
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Put this powder on.

394
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,460
There are many poisonous things in the forest.

395
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,460
If they bite you, you will not be able to stand it.

396
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
What powder is this?

397
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
It's the osmanthus powder.

398
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Is it really useful?

399
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
How can you know if you don't try?

400
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
This...

401
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Is it like this?

402
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Yes.

403
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Sir.

404
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
It's almost done.

405
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,460
Do you like my grandson?

406
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,460
You want to take advantage and touch it a few times, right?

407
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
Don't touch it.

408
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,460
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,460
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,460
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,460
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
Why are you laughing?

422
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,460
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

423
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
I just...

424
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,460
I just want to rub this powder evenly.

425
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
I didn't say you took advantage of me.

426
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
Why are you nervous?

427
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Besides,

428
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
you haven't always been like this.

429
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,460
All right.

430
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,460
Go ahead.

431
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
Remember.

432
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,460
When you find the doctor,

433
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,460
you must be more stable and keep a low profile.

434
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
He doesn't like to talk too much.

435
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Especially you.

436
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,460
Don't worry.

437
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,460
The first-class is my strength.

438
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
I'm going.

439
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
Lanyan.

440
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Go.

441
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Pour a cup of wine for the head of the family.

442
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Yes.

443
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
I don't like

444
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
people touching my things.

445
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
But I like to see people off.

446
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Of course.

447
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,460
Who dares to touch Mr. Yan's things?

448
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
I heard that

449
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,460
Liao Wenhua will take over

450
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
the fish in the capital of the southeast.

451
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,460
Liao Wenhua is Mr. Yan's man.

452
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
It will be much more convenient

453
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,460
for us to do some business in the future.

454
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,460
In terms of exploring the Eastern Camp,

455
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,460
what material and list do you need?

456
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,460
I'll provide you with everything you need.

457
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
I never leave behind

458
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,460
the business of making money.

459
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,460
It's a good deal for me to do business with Mr. Yan.

460
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,460
I'm relieved.

461
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Come on.

462
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Let's have a good talk.

463
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
Pour the wine.

464
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
It's so beautiful, sir.

465
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
It's like a star.

466
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
Sir, there are so many snakes.

467
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
Don't worry.

468
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
We have snake powder on our body.

469
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
As long as we don't touch them,

470
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
we'll be fine.

471
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Okay.

472
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Snake!

473
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
Sir!

474
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Snake!

475
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
It turns out that we are not afraid of the sky

476
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
or the earth.

477
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
What we are afraid of is snakes.

478
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,460
I've been playing with snakes since I was a child.

479
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
I'm just afraid of snakes.

480
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
I can't do it.

481
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
Okay.

482
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
We don't know

483
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,460
if we'll step on snakes again.

484
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Do you want me to walk with you?

485
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
No, sir.

486
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
Sir,

487
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
I'm not afraid of snakes.

488
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
I'm not afraid.

489
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,460
You're not afraid of snakes again?

490
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
No.

491
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
Let's go.

492
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,460
Sir!

493
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
Sir!

494
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
Sir!

495
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,460
In the wilderness,

496
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
snakes are not dangerous.

497
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
They are just too many.

498
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
They make people suspicious.

499
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
If I guess right,

500
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
someone put these snakes

501
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,460
here to raise them.

502
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Sir,

503
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
look, sir.

504
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,460
There's a little wooden house.

505
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
I think that's the house of the doctor.

506
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,460
That person has a rule of conduct.

507
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
It's not appropriate for the officials to be here.

508
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Uncle said

509
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
it's not appropriate for the doctors to be here.

510
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Sir, please give me the token.

511
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Sir,

512
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
the person has been sent away.

513
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,460
No one will see it.

514
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,460
Sir,

515
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,460
is Mao Haifeng reliable?

516
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
Mao Haifeng has taken the territory

517
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,460
that was taken away by our Ming Dynasty.

518
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
He has been growing

519
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
in power.

520
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,460
There's no problem

521
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,460
if we cooperate on this.

522
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
His ability

523
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
is not in my sight.

524
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,460
As for his character,

525
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,460
I've arranged it.

526
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,460
If he has a second heart,

527
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
I'll know it in the first time.

528
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
That's good.

529
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,460
After all,

530
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
Mao Haifeng is a Japanese pirate.

531
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
I have to be careful.

532
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
I'll go to the mountain

533
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
to protect him.

534
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,460
By the way, sir,

535
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,460
he said Lu Yi was poisoned.

536
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,460
I'm afraid that he's not safe.

537
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
What do you think?

538
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,460
It's none of my business.

539
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Thanks.

540
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Yixian.

541
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Your Highness Yixian.

542
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,460
Great.

543
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
Please save him.

544
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
We are here to save you.

545
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,060
How did you find this place?

546
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,860
I heard that a medical fairy lives in Fengling Pavilion.

547
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,260
So we came to see her.

548
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,660
There is no medical fairy here.

549
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,260
There are various herbs here.

550
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,060
You have the smell of herbs.

551
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,660
I didn't guess wrongly.

552
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,060
You are a medical fairy.

553
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,860
Your Highness.

554
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,660
Please save her.

555
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,060
If you don't save her, no one can save her.

556
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,460
What is your relationship with her?

557
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,660
I am her maid.

558
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,860
Tell the truth.

559
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,660
It's true.

560
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,660
You should find another one.

561
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,060
Your Highness.

562
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,060
I will tell the truth.

563
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,060
I am her maid.

564
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,860
But Young Master fell in love with me.

565
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,060
So we...

566
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,860
He fell in love with you?

567
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,460
He didn't fall in love with me before.

568
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
I seduced him.

569
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,060
Young Master didn't control himself and obeyed me.

570
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
So we came to Jiangmen.

571
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,860
But God doesn't want to see our love.

572
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,860
He wants us to suffer.

573
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
We are different.

574
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,660
His father didn't agree.

575
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,060
His father didn't agree.

576
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,860
He took the dog to chase us.

577
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,060
Dog?

578
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,860
You know that dog's nose is very sharp.

579
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,060
He chased us wherever we went.

580
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,260
We had a hard time on the way.

581
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,460
We finally arrived in Jiangnan.

582
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
We met a bad man.

583
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,660
Young Master is poisoned.

584
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Young Master and I have been together for a long time.

585
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,660
I am his maid.

586
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,060
He is the only one who doesn't marry me.

587
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,860
Your Highness.

588
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,260
Please save him.

589
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,060
If he dies, I will die with him.

590
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,060
I will die with him.

591
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,260
Yixian, he is too impudent.

592
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Do you want to die with him?

593
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,460
No.

594
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Your Highness should die in peace with me.

595
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,660
Your Highness.

596
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,620
Your Highness.

597
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,660
Why are you crying?

598
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,260
Your Highness.

599
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,860
It's her fault.

600
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,460
You used your hands to hit me to death and killed several snakes I raised.

601
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,660
Only the Guan family has this kind of spirit.

602
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,860
Secondly, what is Zi Yan?

603
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,060
This is not a secret seal that can be bought in the market.

604
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,460
To be honest, who are you?

605
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,260
So you knew it was you and you're still pretending.

606
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,660
Are you going to save me or not?

607
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,060
I'm not going to save the people in the Guan family.

608
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,660
This is my rule.

609
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,460
Since it's a rule, you can't change it at will.

610
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,860
If you don't save him, I'll kill you!

611
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,460
If you're willing to trade your life for a life,

612
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,660
and live or die,

613
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,460
I can consider saving him.

614
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
Then how can you guarantee that after I die,

615
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,860
you won't go back on your word?

616
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,460
Believe it or not, you can kill me.

617
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,460
I won't suffer any loss if I have such a handsome lover.

618
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,460
Jin Xia.

619
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,060
Jin Xia.

620
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,860
You saved me many times.

621
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,460
I owe you my life.

622
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
I can't just die.

623
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,060
But you must remember

624
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
that after I die, I must take care of my mother,

625
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,660
my master, and Dayang.

626
00:35:43,060 --> 00:36:06,620
Also, when I'm in the

627
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Yi Xian, I don't need anyone else to trade my life for.

628
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,620
If you're willing to trade your life for a life,

629
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,420
I'll definitely let him live.

630
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,820
It's a deal.

631
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,820
My lord.

632
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,820
My lord.

633
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,820
My lord.

634
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,020
If he didn't take the purple smoke,

635
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,620
I'm still 70% sure.

636
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,420
Now, he has two toxic substances in his body.

637
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,220
It's not easy to cure him.

638
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,620
It's already like this.

639
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,020
Let's just be a wild horse.

640
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,620
Yi Xian, please take the medicine.

641
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,020
I'll take it.

642
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,420
I'll take it.

643
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,820
Come in with me.

644
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,020
Thank you.

645
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,820
My lord.

646
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,020
Come.

647
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,820
Where should we go?

648
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,020
If the mark is right, it should be that way.

649
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
Let's go.

650
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,220
Let's go.

651
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,820
Thank you for saving me.

652
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,020
I can't repay you for your kindness.

653
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,620
If you need anything, just tell me.

654
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,620
I'll help you to finish it.

655
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,020
I've already stopped the poison in his body.

656
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,620
But I didn't promise you

657
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,620
that I would cure him.

658
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,220
Your highness.

659
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,220
The old man has been killed by the Holy Bible.

660
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,020
Although you hate the officials,

661
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,220
I believe that as long as you have a patient,

662
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,420
you'll save him.

663
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,620
Right?

664
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,820
Not necessarily.

665
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
Your highness.

666
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,220
I don't care.

667
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,020
Don't waste your energy.

668
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Have a rest.

669
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
My lord.

670
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,420
What's going on?

671
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,020
Why are you still so calm?

672
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,620
I don't believe that I'm short-lived.

673
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,220
late

674
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,220
late

675
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:29,920
late

676
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,420
The sl burn will only be jiu yu shi the same way to the entree's name.

677
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
It's better.

678
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,340
Let's eat.

679
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,100
I guess

680
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,060
your breakfast

681
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,340
is mainly light.

682
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,620
So I picked

683
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,820
all the vegetables

684
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,500
from your yard.

685
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,900
It's clean. Don't worry.

686
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,820
Especially this sweet potato porridge.

687
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,660
I started to cook it

688
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,540
before dawn.

689
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,060
It's thick and sweet.

690
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,020
It must be delicious.

691
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,100
Sit down.

692
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,580
Try it.

693
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,260
What's this?

694
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,620
Mushroom.

695
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,340
I usually cook some vegetables.

696
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,940
But if I cook,

697
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,140
sometimes I can't control

698
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,420
the time and heat.

699
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,740
Don't mind it.

700
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,060
Forget it.

701
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,020
Don't eat this.

702
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,820
I'll eat it.

703
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,380
You eat this first.

704
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,900
I'll check if it's salty.

705
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,560
clay stats

706
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,340
You eat first.

707
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
It's so hot.

708
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
His illness is getting worse.

709
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,020
Don't go.

710
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,940
Sir. Sir.

711
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
I won't go.

712
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,420
I won't go.

713
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Is he really in love with someone?

714
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,860
If he really dies because of this,

715
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,060
he can't go back to the capital.

716
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,580
Then he will be in big trouble.

717
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,380
No.

718
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,180
I must find a way to move him.

719
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,180
I must let him help to save him.

720
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,420
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I'm sorry.

731
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,420
I'm sorry.

734
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
I'm sorry.

735
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
I'm sorry.

736
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I'm sorry.

737
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
I'm sorry.

738
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm sorry.

739
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm sorry.

740
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm sorry.

741
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm sorry.

742
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm sorry.

743
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
I'm sorry.

744
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
I'm sorry.

745
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
I'm sorry.

746
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm sorry.

747
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,420
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,420
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
I'm sorry.

754
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I'm sorry.

755
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,420
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
I'm sorry.

757
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
I'm sorry.

758
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm sorry.

759
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I'm sorry.

760
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,420
I'm sorry.

761
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
I'm sorry.
