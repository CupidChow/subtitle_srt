I am in love

with Lu Yi

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can make money

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
by buying a red envelope

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
by buying a red envelope

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and find a new job

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Yes.

57
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,840
Please.

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Wait.

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
Take a rest.

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,520
When you're done,

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,760
I'll go back.

62
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,160
How could she

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,000
not know what a man is doing

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
while he's sleeping?

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,000
It's the tradition of the Eastern people.

66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,240
Women can't ask

67
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
what men are doing.

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,760
It's normal that she doesn't know.

69
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,320
If we can't find any clues,

70
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,520
we'll think of other ways.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,920
If you need anything,

72
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
just come to me.

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,880
Thank you, Madam.

74
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
This way, please.

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,440
Okay.

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,120
Stay here.

77
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,480
Thank you, Madam.

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,080
What can I do?

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,720
You're a grown-up.

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
You don't even walk.

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
You scared me.

82
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
You scared me.

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,600
You're a grown-up.

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,160
What should we do now?

85
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Should we send

86
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,840
the Eastern camp's mother and son back?

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Will the Imperial Guards

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,760
send them back?

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,520
No.

90
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,760
That's right.

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
Why should we send them back?

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
It'll be useful

93
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,720
if we keep the mother and son.

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Go.

95
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,440
Chief.

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Chief Mao.

97
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,760
Isn't this Miss Zhai?

98
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,040
Why are you here?

99
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,640
You...

100
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
Lord Yan saw me like her,

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,840
so he sent her to me.

102
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,440
Lord Yan.

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
I heard that

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
Zhou Xianyi

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
wanted to spend 10,000 taels to buy her.

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,840
But it didn't work.

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Look.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,640
I didn't spend even a single tael.

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,160
Now...

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,360
Your wound...

111
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,320
Miss Zhai.

112
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
She likes to eat hard.

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
It's more exciting

114
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
to play like this.

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,120
Right?

116
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,320
What did you say?

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,560
I'm going to kill you.

119
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,600
Kill me?

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,440
Do you believe

121
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,720
that I'll let the brothers

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
who gave you to me

123
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
have a taste of it?

124
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
What's the value of

125
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
a horse that costs 10,000 taels?

126
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
You know me.

127
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,920
You're so sharp.

128
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,760
When I saw you

129
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
before,

130
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,000
I was so proud.

131
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
I didn't expect

132
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,960
you to be so kind.

133
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,040
You're the boss.

134
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
Stop making fun of me.

135
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,800
Let's get to the point.

136
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
Qi Weigang

137
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
and Shaolin Monk

138
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,040
have already supported Yu Dayong.

139
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,680
We can't

140
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,040
be careless about this.

141
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,960
I understand.

142
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't worry.

143
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,400
How's the 500 reinforcements?

144
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,200
They'll be here in three days.

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,280
Good.

146
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
Once the reinforcements arrive,

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,320
Wu Shouxu will be furious.

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
I'll see how he can attack Cangang without any worries.

149
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,920
Everyone.

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,680
Tomorrow,

151
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,520
a ghost ship will set off to the sea.

152
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,800
Shaolin Monk will sneak in

153
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,560
and attack the bandits

154
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,480
who are in Cangang.

155
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,240
Shangguan.

156
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Please take care of

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Shaolin Monk's important task.

158
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,360
No problem.

159
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,360
Leave it to me.

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
Chief Qi.

161
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
We've been watching

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
the bandits of Mao Haifeng for a long time.

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
They're in Cangang.

164
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,600
They're outside the encampment.

165
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,360
They have Cangang as their defense.

166
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,240
They're high up and below the forest.

167
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,400
They're strong.

168
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
So we can't attack them.

169
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,800
You've brought five tons of cannons.

170
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,960
They're suitable for fighting on the mountain.

171
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
You'll attack from behind the mountain.

172
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,200
I'll lead Shaolin Monk

173
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,600
to deal with the bandits who are in Cangang.

174
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,520
Then we'll go up.

175
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,920
We'll meet up

176
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,640
and attack Mao Haifeng from behind.

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,720
Good.

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,720
What about the ghost ship?

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
We can't fail this time.

180
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,320
We need a smart soldier to take charge.

181
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,640
General Yu.

182
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,400
Do you have a suitable candidate?

183
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,080
I'll go.

184
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,600
I made the ghost ship.

185
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,480
I know him best.

186
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
Let me drive it.

187
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,120
General Yu only needs to send a few

188
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,080
water-based soldiers

189
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,120
to go out with me

190
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
and detonate the water mine.

191
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,960
I made the water mine.

192
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,280
I'll go with you.

193
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,720
No.

194
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,280
You two haven't been on the battlefield.

195
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,120
This mission is too dangerous.

196
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
You can't go.

197
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,320
I haven't fought in the battlefield.

198
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,160
But I've been in the martial arts world for so many years.

199
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
I've never encountered anything.

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,800
But my surname is Lu.

201
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,960
Since you don't know water-based soldiers,

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
don't go up with me.

203
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't want to cause more trouble.

204
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,880
I don't know water-based soldiers.

205
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,480
You'll know tomorrow.

206
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,360
How about

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
you and the Shaolin brothers go together?

208
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,840
I know the fire.

209
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,200
I'll handle the water-based mines.

210
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,240
Shangguan,

211
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,440
you should lead the Shaolin Monk

212
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
to attack from the road.

213
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,520
There are special gunpowder soldiers in my army.

214
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll find two skilled fighters

215
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
and let them go.

216
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,680
The water mines are different from ordinary gunpowder.

217
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
When we detonate the water,

218
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
if we don't enter the sea,

219
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,280
we can't hide.

220
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,800
I'll go.

221
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,520
Mr. Lu, you can't.

222
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
Mr. Wu is right.

223
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,680
Mr. Lu,

224
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,880
if anything happens to you,

225
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,360
we can't explain to your father.

226
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,560
I think

227
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,040
you should wait for the news in the camp.

228
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,680
General,

229
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,120
how many soldiers do you have?

230
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Over 8,000.

231
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,800
What's wrong?

232
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,760
Tell me,

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
among the 8,000 soldiers,

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
who has no father or mother?

235
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,280
Why can they go to war?

236
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,960
But I can't.

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,520
General,

238
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,640
you don't just look down on me,

239
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
but also my father.

240
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,120
I...

241
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,400
I've always respected you

242
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,840
and admired you.

243
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,520
You're not afraid of losing,

244
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,320
but you're always thinking about serving the country.

245
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,240
But why today,

246
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,040
you and General Yu

247
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,440
are not thinking about how to take the throne,

248
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
but afraid that I'll get you all involved.

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,440
I'll tell my father

250
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
in a letter.

251
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,520
No matter what happens,

252
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,760
I won't get anyone involved.

253
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,080
In this case,

254
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,920
won't you two nod?

255
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,760
In that case,

256
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,040
I'll leave it to you two

257
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,120
to make it clear.

258
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,240
Sure.

259
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Father, take care.

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,920
The weather is so nice today.

261
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,240
Yes.

262
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,920
Master,

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,160
why did you get off the bed?

264
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Why didn't you lie down for a while?

265
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,960
I'm almost recovered.

266
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,920
If I lie down again,

267
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,880
my bones will break apart.

268
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,520
It's all my fault.

269
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,960
I was too willful.

270
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,360
Father has worked for us for a lifetime.

271
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,720
I didn't expect that

272
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,760
at this age,

273
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,320
I would suffer like this.

274
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,800
It's good that you know.

275
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,280
Don't let Master worry about you anymore.

276
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Look at me.

277
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Am I right, Master?

278
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,680
As long as you two

279
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,960
can be safe and sound,

280
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
it's better than anything else.

281
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,920
Yes.

282
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Take Master for a walk.

283
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
I'll go and get the medicine for him.

284
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,960
Okay.

285
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,680
Okay.

286
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,560
Father,

287
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,960
let's go to the front to get some sun.

288
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,320
Jesus.

289
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,080
Jesus.

290
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,360
What happened?

291
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't know.

292
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't follow.

293
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,120
You have to come and continue.

294
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,020
Gift

295
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,020
I...

296
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,160
I'm sorry.

297
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,600
It's not your fault.

298
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,660
Don't explain this to me.

299
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,940
Feel energy, feelyson.

300
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,020
Run.

301
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,300
I feel something wrong.

302
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Where is my wife and son?

303
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,020
Don't worry.

304
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,220
We take good care of them.

305
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,820
As long as you tell us,

306
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,100
we will know it.

307
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,620
We can guarantee that

308
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,420
you and your wife and son are safe.

309
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,700
Despicable.

310
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,260
You threaten me in this way.

311
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,260
Take them away.

312
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,100
Go.

313
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,620
Hurry.

314
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,220
Go.

315
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,140
I brought them here.

316
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,620
Madam, it's him.

317
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,740
Who are you?

318
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,100
Where are you from?

319
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,500
Why are you hiding so many firearms in Hangzhou?

320
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,660
You'd better tell us the truth.

321
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,100
Or...

322
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,820
Say it.

323
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,940
I'm Wang Mazi.

324
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,980
I'm from Zhou Mountain.

325
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,820
You know that Zhou Mountain is in chaos.

326
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,860
I took my wife and son to Hangzhou to hide the firearms.

327
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,380
What about the firearms?

328
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,140
In this age,

329
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,540
I can earn a lot of money

330
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,380
by eating.

331
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,100
We have two mouths to feed.

332
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,900
Our children grow up every day.

333
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,420
They need a lot of things.

334
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,940
We can only take risks.

335
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,260
We should sell firearms to our brothers

336
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,020
and make some money.

337
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,460
You're a good eater.

338
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,940
Wang Mazi,

339
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,460
how many times have we seen you?

340
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,500
Besides,

341
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,380
if you really want to eat,

342
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,620
a handful of them

343
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,100
can feed you for half a year.

344
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,180
You don't need to risk your life

345
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,220
to sell so many firearms.

346
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,460
It seems that you really don't care about your wife and son.

347
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,860
Your wife has nothing to say to you.

348
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,740
She explained to us all the time

349
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,500
that you had nothing to do with firearms.

350
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,060
You're innocent.

351
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,700
She thought that

352
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,820
you could come to the station to find her when you went back.

353
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,580
I didn't expect you to come here now.

354
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,500
But,

355
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,060
with your wife's feelings for you,

356
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,140
even if you work for your master

357
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,620
and ignore them,

358
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,100
I guess they won't blame you.

359
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,820
I...

360
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,100
He really knows nothing.

361
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,780
Please let them go.

362
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,300
In that case,

363
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,940
their lives

364
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,060
will be in the hands of

365
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,700
a man who knows everything.

366
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,460
Can you promise to let them go

367
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,740
if I tell you?

368
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,620
If you really mean it,

369
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,580
I will keep your family's life.

370
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,780
I'm under Mao Haifeng's control.

371
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,780
He asked me to sneak into Hangzhou

372
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,700
and organize the internal force we have arranged

373
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
to meet with the captured soldiers

374
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,700
to take down Hangzhou.

375
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,900
What?

376
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,500
My son is in your hands.

377
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
How dare I lie to you?

378
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,100
How many soldiers are there?

379
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,900
Five hundred.

380
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,100
The internal force in the city?

381
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Thirty.

382
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,300
When will the plan be completed?

383
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Three days later.

384
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,500
Mrs. Qi,

385
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,300
I've told you everything I know.

386
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,500
Black Wind, let's go.

387
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,900
You promised me.

388
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,300
I keep my word.

389
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,700
Since I've promised you,

390
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,900
after the task is done,

391
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,100
I'll let you go.

392
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,900
Take them away.

393
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,500
Yes.

394
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,300
Yes.

395
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,500
Let's go.

396
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,900
Mrs. Qi,

397
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,700
the pirates are here.

398
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
It's such an important thing.

399
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,700
Shouldn't we inform the general

400
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
and ask him to send the troops back?

401
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,300
No.

402
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,300
It's possible that the captured soldiers set up a trap.

403
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,700
Most of the soldiers in the city are family members of the Ming army.

404
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,500
If we attack Hangzhou now,

405
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,300
it'll be difficult for the brothers of Ceng Gang to advance.

406
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,700
What you mean is

407
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,900
if we ask the general to send the troops back,

408
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,900
it's possible that the pirates will set up a trap.

409
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,300
It'll be a loss for Ceng Gang.

410
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,100
If we don't ask the general to send the troops back,

411
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
the people of Hangzhou will be in trouble.

412
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,900
It'll be a disturbance to the morale of the army.

413
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,900
That's right.

414
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,300
So we have to guard the city.

415
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
But the city is full of old and weak people.

416
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,300
They don't even have the ability to protect themselves.

417
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,900
How can we protect the city?

418
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,100
I want to capture the pirates' camp first.

419
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,500
Madam, I'll be frank.

420
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,100
Even if we have good boxing skills,

421
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,900
we can get 500 pirates

422
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,100
and we can take down Hangzhou.

423
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,500
I know.

424
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,300
We'll guard the city first.

425
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,100
If we can't defend the city, we'll fight.

426
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,500
We'll defend it and hold on.

427
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,100
I'd rather die than let my family be captured and be a prisoner.

428
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,300
You have the courage.

429
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,900
I admire you.

430
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm willing to guard the city with you.

431
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,100
Since it's your birthday,

432
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,300
I'm a man. How can I be a guard?

433
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Madam, I'm willing to do my best to guard Hangzhou.

434
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,500
You're not the citizens of Hangzhou. You're willing to guard the city for us?

435
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,100
I thank you on behalf of all the people of Hangzhou.

436
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,500
As long as there are people with blood, they're like us.

437
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,300
Okay. From now on, we have to be ready to take them down.

438
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,500
Close the city gates!

439
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,700
Yes!

440
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Hurry!

441
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,100
General Yu, we'll set out first.

442
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
We'll lure the pirates' ships out of the harbor.

443
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,100
After the pirates are in the port, we'll use the bomb to destroy the ship.

444
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,500
You can attack after you see the fire.

445
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,900
Don't worry. Once we receive the signal, we'll attack immediately.

446
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
What about General Qi?

447
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,700
I've already told him.

448
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
He'll take the lead from the rear.

449
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,700
We'll attack from the front and back. We'll definitely take him down.

450
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,100
Okay.

451
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,700
Master Li!

452
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,920
Seok value the

453
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,700
uro rozels!

454
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,000
Hurry!

455
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,900
Take one out!

456
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,660
Please don't worry.

457
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,940
Take care, you two.

458
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,900
Let's go.

459
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:42,060
Deputy Chief Gui får g

460
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,080
家门,出没事

461
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
Yes

462
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,240
Brother, it's here

463
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,980
Brace for attack

464
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,760
Yes

465
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:28,980
Harder

466
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,660
Harder

467
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,140
Yes

468
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
Cut off Ei Pin

469
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,860
Yes

470
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,380
The pirates are here

471
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,100
They're here. Let's go.

472
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
What's going on?

473
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Brother, what should we do?

474
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Great. We made it.

475
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
General Li, how are they?

476
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
They're here.

477
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Let's go.

478
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
Let's go.

479
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Let's go.

480
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,900
Let's go.

481
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Let's go.

482
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Let's go.

483
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Let's go.

484
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Let's go.

485
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Let's go.

486
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Let's go.

487
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Let's go.

488
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
Let's go.

489
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Let's go.

490
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
Let's go.

491
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Get ready to attack.

492
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
Let's go.

493
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Their main battleship has left the port.

494
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Brother, we're running out of time.

495
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Are you okay?

496
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Of course I'm fine.

497
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
If we don't destroy all the pirates' ships

498
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
and let them have a warning,

499
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
it won't be easy to have such a chance again.

500
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
I understand.

501
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
You go that way.

502
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I'll go this way.

503
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Okay.

504
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
Let's go.

505
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Let's go.

506
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Let's go.

507
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Let's go.

508
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Book your weapons and babyент it.

509
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
Okay, give us a bye.

510
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Okay, your organism!

511
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
I can't start yet,

512
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
give us a good one.

513
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
Yes.

514
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,900
There's a group down there.

515
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
ne encore down!

516
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
There is a group down there!

517
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,900
The group down there!

518
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Come along!

519
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,900
There's a group down here!

520
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Shoot!

521
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
It's a group of enemies!

522
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,060
sister

523
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,220
Wife

524
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,740
Well go

525
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,060
strangely

526
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,060
Great.

527
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Great.

528
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
All soldiers, listen to my order.

529
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Let's go.

530
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
Yes.

531
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Go.

532
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
Tell them

533
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
that all men under sixty years old in the city

534
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,060
will gather at the east gate tonight.

535
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,060
Those who haven't arrived,

536
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
follow the details.

537
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
Put the notice in every corner of the city.

538
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Yes.

539
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,060
Madam,

540
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,060
the weapons in the mansion have been collected.

541
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
That's all?

542
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
Yes.

543
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Madam,

544
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,060
what happened?

545
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
The scout came to report that

546
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,060
the Japanese army is coming to the city in twenty miles.

547
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
I guess

548
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
they will arrive at the city in the evening.

549
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
In the evening?

550
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Didn't you say in three days?

551
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,060
Did Wang Mazi

552
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
lie to us?

553
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
Not necessarily.

554
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,060
If we caught the Japanese pirates last night,

555
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
and if we find any missing fish,

556
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,060
we can inform Mao Haifeng.

557
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
It's not impossible

558
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
for them to act in advance.

559
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
It's not the time

560
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
to find the reason.

561
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
Since last night,

562
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
I sent people to send some people

563
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
who are old and weak

564
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,060
out of the city.

565
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
But they don't want to leave.

566
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
They all want to guard the city together.

567
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
But

568
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
they haven't received any training.

569
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,060
They can't fight against the enemy.

570
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
The weapons are not enough.

571
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
Even if it's enough,

572
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
I'm afraid it will be too much

573
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
for them to fight.

574
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
There are few people

575
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
who can use it.

576
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
They don't need to use it.

577
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
They can just take it.

578
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
Madam,

579
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
I'm sorry.

580
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,060
I'm afraid

581
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,060
it's not enough to guard the city.

582
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,060
I know

583
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
the military power is too large.

584
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,060
So

585
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,060
we can only show them

586
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,060
an empty city.

587
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Empty city?

588
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
The Japanese pirates

589
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
in the city

590
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,060
have been caught by us.

591
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,060
The Japanese pirates outside the city

592
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
don't know the truth of the city.

593
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,060
As long as there are enough soldiers

594
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
standing on the city wall,

595
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
the Japanese pirates

596
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,060
can't tell how many soldiers are there.

597
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Then

598
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
they won't dare to attack us easily.

599
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,060
But

600
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
what if

601
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,060
we show them

602
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,820
the

603
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,060
horse's feet?

604
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
By the way, Dayang,

605
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
where are the weapons

606
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,060
we took from Wang Ma Si's house?

607
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,060
Those are not enough.

608
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Let's go.

609
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Go to the military treasury.

610
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Go.

611
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,060
Lao Nie, open the treasury.

612
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,060
Madam,

613
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
you must have the general's token

614
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
when you open the treasury.

615
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,060
You know that.

616
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
When the general left,

617
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
I didn't expect the Japanese pirates to attack the city.

618
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
Now the situation is urgent.

619
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
Open the treasury.

620
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,060
I'll take all the consequences.

621
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,060
General,

622
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,060
give the treasury to me.

623
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
I have to watch it closely.

624
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,060
No matter who it is,

625
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
I can't let them

626
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,060
get away from me.

627
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,060
How can you be so stupid?

628
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
I think you should go up

629
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
and get his information.

630
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
What are you talking about?

631
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
How could Mrs. Qi

632
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,060
be as reckless as you?

633
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Madam,

634
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,060
let me say one more thing.

635
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,060
They are

636
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,060
of unknown origin.

637
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,060
They are not from the Qi family.

638
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Don't listen to their nonsense

639
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,060
and act rashly.

640
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
I have my own way

641
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,060
when I do things.

642
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Open the treasury.

643
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,060
I need weapons to fight the enemy.

644
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
If you don't have the general's token,

645
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
you can't open the treasury.

646
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Will you open it or not?

647
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,060
I will do it.

648
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
Let me see

649
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,060
who dares to go up.

650
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,060
Madam,

651
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,060
I can't.

652
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,060
The Japanese are coming.

653
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Hangzhou is in danger.

654
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
I know the military order is not good.

655
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,060
But this is a special situation.

656
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,060
It concerns the people of the city.

657
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,060
When General Qi comes back,

658
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,060
I will take the initiative

659
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,060
to take the punishment.

660
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,060
Mrs. Qi is really a woman.

661
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,060
I have to learn from her.

662
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Learn from her?

663
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
No need.

664
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
You are over-confident.

665
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
No, no, no.

666
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Take it.

667
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,060
The people of the city have gone to guard the city.

668
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,060
Do you still want to stay here

669
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,060
and guard the empty warehouse?

670
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
Dayang, let's go.

671
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
Go.

672
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
Madam, count me in.

673
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
Brothers, go.

674
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
No one is here.

675
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,060
No one is here.

676
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,060
Go.

677
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,060
Go.

678
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
Go.

679
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Go.

680
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
Go.

681
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Go.

682
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
Go.

683
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
Go.

684
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
Go.

685
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
Go.

686
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Go.

687
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
Go.

688
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Go.

689
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
Go.

690
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,060
Go.

691
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,060
Go.

692
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,060
Go.

693
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
Go.

694
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Go.

695
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Go.

696
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Go.

697
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
Go.

698
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,060
Chief, bad news.

699
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,060
All the ships in the port have been blown up.

700
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
What did you say?

701
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
The Ming army has occupied the port.

702
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
The ships and the soldiers are gone.

703
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
Useless.

704
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
You can't even defend the port.

705
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,060
Chief,

706
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,340
the

707
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Ming army has been found.

708
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
And they also brought the fire weapons.

709
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
What should we do?

710
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Chief,

711
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
how about

712
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
we run away?

713
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,060
If we don't run away,

714
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
it will be too late.

715
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Yes.

716
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
Yes, Chief.

717
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,060
Where are 500 soldiers?

718
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,060
They will arrive in Hangzhou in two days.

719
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
You guys

720
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
burn this place

721
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,060
and take that bitch with you.

722
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
Let's go.

723
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
Yes.

724
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,060
Yes.

725
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
Yu Dayong,

726
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,060
blow up my ship

727
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,060
and I will take your life.

728
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,060
Master,

729
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,060
I just got the news.

730
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
The pirates in Cen Gang

731
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
have been destroyed by Wu Shouxu.

732
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,060
All the warships and port

733
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,060
have been destroyed.

734
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,060
Wu Shouxu?

735
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Where did he get so many fire weapons?

736
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,060
He can destroy Cen Gang?

737
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
It was arranged to report to the spies

738
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,060
in Yu Dayong's camp.

739
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,060
Lu Yi helped him.

740
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,060
Lu Yi helped him.

741
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
He helped Yu Dayong

742
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,060
to build the submarine

743
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
that blew up the warships.

744
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,060
Great.

745
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
Lu Yi again.

746
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,060
And

747
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
Qi Weigang

748
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
attacked Mao Haifeng's mountain village

749
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
from the back mountain

750
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,060
when Cen Gang was in chaos.

751
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Mao Haifeng has burned down the mountain village

752
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
and ran away.

753
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Mao Haifeng is so lucky.

754
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,060
He can run away.

755
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
It seems

756
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
he and Wu Shouxu

757
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
are going to fight again.

758
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,940
The

759
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
How far is it

760
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
from Hangzhou?

761
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,060
Ten miles.

762
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,060
We are going to march

763
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,060
day and night.

764
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,060
It's one day earlier

765
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,060
than we expected.

766
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
Great.

767
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,060
Let's

768
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,060
have a good rest

769
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,060
here

770
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,060
and prepare for the attack.

771
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
The chief

772
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,060
must be eager

773
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
to watch

774
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,060
Wu Shouxu's good play.

775
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
Well,

776
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
send two people

777
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,060
to check

778
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
the situation in Hangzhou.

779
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
We must

780
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
do our best

781
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
to attack them.

782
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Yes.

783
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
I didn't expect

784
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,060
that after living for a long time,

785
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Dong Qisheng

786
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
would lead the troops

787
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,060
to attack the city.

788
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Report.

789
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
General.

790
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,060
How is it going?

791
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
We have just searched Cen Gang

792
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
and reported

793
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,060
the soldiers of the mountain village.

794
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,060
Those who survived

795
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
surrendered.

796
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
But

797
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
we didn't find Mao Haifeng.

798
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
He escaped again.

799
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
Did you find

800
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Lu Qianshi and Xie?

801
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Report.

802
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
The soldiers said

803
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,060
they searched for him

804
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
in Cen Gang many times.

805
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
But they didn't find

806
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
Lu Qianshi

807
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
and Xie Shaobangzhu.

808
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
According to the war,

809
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
there are a lot of debris

810
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
and traces of fire.

811
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
They suspect

812
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
they have been in the rain.

813
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
They were

814
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
shot by Han Shui

815
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
by accident.

816
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,060
Impossible.

817
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Impossible.

818
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,060
They are so good at it.

819
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
They can't escape from this.

820
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
What do you mean by suspect?

821
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Stop talking nonsense.

822
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Tell them to

823
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,060
follow my order.

824
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
They must search.

825
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
If they continue to search,

826
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
they will be searched carefully.

827
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
If they can't find him,

828
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
they can't rest.

829
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
Yes.

830
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
Wait.

831
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
Lu Qianshi and Xie

832
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,060
have made a great victory for us.

833
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Whether they are dead or alive,

834
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,060
even if they are killed,

835
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,060
they will find them

836
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,060
no matter what.

837
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
Yes.

838
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,060
It's not the right way.

839
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,060
Let's go out and find them.

840
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,060
I'll go with you.

841
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,060
I'll go with you.

842
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060
Come on.

843
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
What's going on?

844
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
Madam,

845
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
we didn't find anything strange.

846
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,060
Madam,

847
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
it's already midnight.

848
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
The pirates didn't attack us.

849
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Do you think they

850
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
dare not attack us

851
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,060
because they saw

852
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
our men on the city wall?

853
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Now we are happy

854
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
and we are still in the early stage.

855
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
If the bandits come to us,

856
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
we might be scared away.

857
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
But the people behind the pirates

858
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,060
are Mao Haifeng

859
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,060
and he has been in the sea for a long time.

860
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
He is very cunning

861
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
and he won't be scared away easily.

862
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,060
It makes sense.

863
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,060
I had a fight with Mao Haifeng before.

864
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,060
He is not a good man.

865
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,060
Since Madam knows

866
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
they won't be scared away,

867
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,060
why would she still

868
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
arrange this show?

869
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
I just want to stall for a while.

870
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,060
The pirates are doing something wrong.

871
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,060
General will receive the news

872
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
and come back.

873
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,060
I hope they can come back in time.

874
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
Yes.

875
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,060
Why are you looking at me?

876
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060
Miss, it's late.

877
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,060
You should go back to sleep.

878
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,060
Why are you here?

879
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,060
I'm not here to guard the city.

880
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,060
I just see that there are many guards here.

881
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
The pirates are coming.

882
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
Someone is protecting me.

883
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,060
Here, take it.

884
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,060
If they really come back,

885
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,060
you should find a place

886
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
to hide.

887
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
I can't care about you.

888
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
Go.

889
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,060
Chief.

890
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
What's the situation?

891
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,060
There are many people

892
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
on the wall of Hangzhou.

893
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,060
They are all soldiers with full equipment.

894
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
It seems that there are about half a hundred people.

895
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,060
Half a hundred soldiers on the wall of Hangzhou?

896
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,060
Impossible.

897
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,060
Wu Shou Xu

898
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060
and the guards in the city

899
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
are impossible to have so many people.

900
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,060
Unless he knows our plan

901
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,060
and then he sneaks some people

902
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,060
into the city in advance

903
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
from the secret passage.

904
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Otherwise,

905
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,060
in a day,

906
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
there will be so many soldiers

907
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
in the city.

908
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,060
I remember

909
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
Wang Mazi sneaked into Hangzhou

910
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,060
and checked the streets

911
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,060
of the city.

912
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,060
He didn't find any secret passage.

913
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,060
Could it be that

914
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Wang Mazi has betrayed us?

915
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
He sent us all the fake news.

916
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,060
Where is Wang Mazi?

917
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
He is still in the city.

918
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
According to the original plan,

919
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
he led his brothers

920
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
to pick us up in the city.

921
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,060
But now

922
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,060
we can't see him light the signal.

923
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,060
Do you think

924
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,060
there is something wrong?

925
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
Impossible.

926
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,060
Impossible.

927
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,060
Wu Shou Xu, Yu Dayou, Qi Weigang

928
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,060
are all in the city.

929
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,060
Who else

930
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
can lead the army in Hangzhou?

931
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,060
I heard

932
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,060
Qi Weigang's wife, Wang,

933
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,060
is different from other women.

934
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,060
She is more cruel than men.

935
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,060
Women?

936
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,060
How can she be cruel?

937
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
Don't be afraid.

938
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,060
You mean...

939
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,060
Tomorrow morning,

940
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,060
you take 200 men

941
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,060
to attack the city

942
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,060
and tell them

943
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,060
the truth.

944
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,060
I know.

945
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,060
I know.

946
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,060
I know.

947
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,060
I know.

948
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,060
I know.

949
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,060
I know.

950
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,060
I know.

951
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
I know.

952
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,060
I know.

953
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,060
I know.

954
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,060
I know.

955
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,060
I know.

956
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,060
I know.

957
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,060
I know.

958
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,060
I know.

959
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,060
I know.

960
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,060
I know.

961
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,060
I know.

962
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,060
