00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeat is still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separated twice

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ooh

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ooh

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ooh

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ooh

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ooh

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ooh

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ooh

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ooh

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ooh

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ooh

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ooh

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ooh

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ooh

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ooh

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ooh

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ooh

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ooh

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ooh

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dad, what about Huang Yu?

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
As long as I'm here,

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll give you some evidence

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's go

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I refuse.

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,640
Just leave.

57
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,520
Sir has just come back to the capital.

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,080
He should be busy 1984 welding.

59
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,120
It's quite late now.

60
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm afraid he won't be here now.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Sir!

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I thought you wouldn't come at this time.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I told you to wait for me, so I came.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How can I let you down?

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't wait for you.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I didn't let you down.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You didn't wait for me?

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Then who was walking outside the door just now?

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You didn't wait for me?

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Fine. I admit that I was waiting for you.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm hungry.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But I'm happy to see you.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hungry again?

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go. I'll take you to eat something delicious.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Where are we?

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lan Pingzi!

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Miss Yan!

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm the famous person in front of His Majesty, Lan Shen Xian.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't call me Pingzi anymore.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sit down.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't stand there.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sir, you want to take me to eat, so you take me here.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm hungry.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm hungry.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm hungry.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You take me here.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lan Shen Xian, what's wrong with you?

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You've become a fairy.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We've known each other for three days, but we still look at each other.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Moreover, we haven't seen each other for months.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I miss her.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Eat.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Try it.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's so delicious.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't want to eat that.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Lan Pingzi, no, Lan Shen Xian.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Congratulations on becoming the famous person in front of His Majesty.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If there's anything good in the future, don't forget me.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I won't forget you.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Of course, don't forget Mr. Lu.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's my duty.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come on.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Drink slowly.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't worry, I can drink.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The happier I am, the more I can't get drunk.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It seems that you've grasped your own happiness.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Happiness?

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Miss Yuan, sometimes you have to grasp your own happiness.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's you.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You don't know that.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The one who is absent-minded is clearly visible.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Come on, don't drink alone.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I toast to you two.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
May you be happy forever.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's not forget our original intention.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Cheers.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Cheers.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Lan Pingzi, how is Bai Lu?

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I take care of her.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
She is a fairy.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
She can eat and live better than you.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She is really a beast.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You have to take good care of Bai Lu.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If anything happens to her, I'm afraid you'll be a fairy.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
By the way, Mr. Lu, I heard that Yan Shi Fan has broken the broken words of Prince Yu's Mansion again.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The Mansion of Prince Yu hasn't received any broken words for three years.

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yan Shi Fan is getting more and more over.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Tomorrow, His Majesty will take the officials to watch Bai Lu.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Everyone will be here.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Be careful.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't worry, I'm a fairy.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're a fairy.

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Come on, let's drink.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Cheers.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Sir, do you remember when you gave me this bracelet, I asked you a question.

139
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sir, you can't bear to part with him or me?

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Of course I remember.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But you haven't answered me yet.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't laugh, just say it.

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Maybe I was afraid of losing you and being angry at you.

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So you already like me at that time, right?

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm so happy now.

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If I can find my parents, my life will be full.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I've asked the Ceng Mansion to investigate.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There should be news soon.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So don't worry.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't be upset.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Welcome, Your Majesty.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
My dear ministers,

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm so happy to be on my way to the mountains.

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I want to thank you.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm so happy to see you.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Your Majesty, this immortal beast is really rare.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We are lucky to have you here today.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, it's really rare.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If it wasn't for your luck,

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
how could there be such an immortal beast?

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Leader Lan, let me see Bai Lu.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's go.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Leader Lan,

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you can make such a magical creature

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
obey your orders and be well-bred.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I will reward you well.

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't dare to take the reward rashly.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's just because the previous life of the emperor

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
is not a mere reward.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's a gift from the emperor.

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

198
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Long live Your Majesty.

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Your Majesty, this immortal beast is white in color.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's full of magical energy.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's an immortal beast that can't be obtained.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Your Majesty, you are so kind to the people.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The people live and work in peace.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The state is peaceful.

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Bai Lu appears at this time.

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He also shows that you are a wise emperor.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I will invite you to eat the food for three months

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to thank you.

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Your Majesty, I think

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
this place lacks your respect.

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Does it seem to be unsatisfactory?

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have the same idea.

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Chief Yan.

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm here.

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What's your suggestion?

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This place is near the Jiuqu Lake.

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There are strange rocks and rocks.

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There are clouds and things.

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I wonder if you can give me

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the word cloud and dragon.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Cloud and dragon?

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You are indeed a person who can read and write.

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The two words are used to pass on the spirit.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The clouds and things are around here.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It seems to be clouded.

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's wonderful.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think it's not appropriate.

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Your Majesty is the real dragon.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The dragon in the clouds.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The divine beast is the grace of God.

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's your servant.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How can you take the word cloud and dragon?

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Chief Yan, where do you know His Majesty?

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Your Majesty is wise.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm a poet.

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Please take it from me.

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Your Majesty.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In the past, Your Majesty

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
received the greetings from the courtiers in Chengtian Prefecture.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You named it the Dragon-Flying Palace.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The people built this palace

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
as your personal palace.

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Why can't you use the word cloud and dragon today?

244
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you going to do it?

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why are you so serious?

246
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The Dragon-Flying Palace was the palace of His Majesty.

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's different.

248
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
His Majesty built this palace

249
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
because of the white dew.

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The white dew is His Majesty's art.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Moreover, His Majesty is here.

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Can't you see it?

253
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I dare not.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Minister Xue.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Do you remember any good names?

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Your Majesty.

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I remember Mr. Yang Ming's poem.

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The sun rises and the moon rises.

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The autumn wind blows and the moon rises.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The moon rises.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I think the word rise is a good word.

262
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It shows the way forward.

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm here to seek the truth.

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yang Ming's poem is good.

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Where are the others?

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think Gao Xun is good.

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Your Majesty is so kind.

268
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A word rise shows your future.

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Minister Luo.

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Your Majesty.

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What do you think?

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Your Majesty.

273
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm stupid.

274
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But I think Gao Xun is a good name.

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Please decide.

276
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You don't offend anyone.

277
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

278
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll call him Gao Xun.

279
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

280
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No.

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
In the next life.

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll follow your best skill.

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay.

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Where is my uniform, Mom?

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I washed it quickly.

286
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,760
You're married?

287
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,840
Both of you?

288
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,520
Yes.

289
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,600
I and Yang Putou

290
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
are married.

291
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,480
Come on, put this on.

292
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,760
What?

293
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,040
I'll take you to meet someone.

294
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,840
Who?

295
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,120
Third brother of the family.

296
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,120
Third brother of the family?

297
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,520
There are three children

298
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,760
in Mr. Yi's family.

299
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,280
I like the third brother of their family.

300
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,200
It's...

301
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,840
How many families did my mother choose?

302
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,840
Why did the Yi family agree so soon?

303
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,480
I...

304
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,360
She hasn't married yet.

305
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,480
I'm not going.

306
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,240
We've agreed.

307
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
How can we just say no?

308
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,120
You said it.

309
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know anything.

310
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,960
No way.

311
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
I promised her.

312
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,120
You promised me.

313
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,680
But...

314
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
I might have drunk too much last night.

315
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
I have a headache.

316
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,800
I can't go.

317
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm not going.

318
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,000
Headache?

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
I can't go.

320
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,360
What headache?

321
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,440
You were so excited just now.

322
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
You have a headache so soon?

323
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
I've made a deal with her.

324
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,000
You know what?

325
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,680
You...

326
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,200
Since you came to Yangzhou,

327
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
I've been waiting for you.

328
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,120
I can't just say no.

329
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,440
And I have a smell of alcohol.

330
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
If you don't believe me, smell it.

331
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,720
It'll be so embarrassing if she smells it.

332
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,360
It's okay.

333
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,040
It's good.

334
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,760
I'll put some sachets for you.

335
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,800
You won't smell it.

336
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,440
I...

337
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
I ate something a little dirty yesterday.

338
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,400
I have a stomachache.

339
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
I'm going to make a hole.

340
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,320
Sit down.

341
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,520
My stomach hurts.

342
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,000
I knew you would be so worried.

343
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,480
Here.

344
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,160
Drink it.

345
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,680
What's this?

346
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,320
Headache.

347
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,520
Mom.

348
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,240
Headache.

349
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,400
Stomachache.

350
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,960
Stomachache.

351
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,760
Okay.

352
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,280
I...

353
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,480
I don't want to go.

354
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Can you spare me?

355
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,800
Can you not let me go?

356
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
No.

357
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,720
I've made a deal with you.

358
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,600
How can I not go?

359
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,840
Right?

360
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,800
You have to go.

361
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
You can't laugh when you're there.

362
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,520
If you want to laugh, you have to go.

363
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,720
You can't laugh when you're there.

364
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
I'm not going.

365
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,840
I'm laughing.

366
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,760
You have to go, Jinxia.

367
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,200
Why do I have to go?

368
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,800
Lin Li is laughing at me.

369
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,560
How can I be ashamed?

370
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,520
I've raised you for more than ten years.

371
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,840
I just hope that one day

372
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,840
you can be fine.

373
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
You...

374
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,320
Find someone to live with.

375
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,720
If you have a child,

376
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,120
I can be a grandmother.

377
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
Right?

378
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,280
I can be a mother.

379
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,560
Why can't I understand?

380
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,520
Anyway, I'm not going.

381
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,480
Chief, don't you understand

382
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
what I said?

383
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
Why are you crying?

384
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,120
It hurts here.

385
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,280
Where does it hurt?

386
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,120
Do you want me to take you to see the doctor?

387
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,320
No.

388
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,960
I feel so bad.

389
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,160
My heart hurts.

390
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,880
My heart hurts.

391
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,720
Okay, I'll go.

392
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,360
I'll go, okay?

393
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,960
You said

394
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
you can't be ashamed.

395
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,560
Then you put on your clothes.

396
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,160
I'll wait for you outside.

397
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,160
Remember to bring a suitcase.

398
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200
You can't smell anything.

399
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,280
What else do you have?

400
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,040
My mother

401
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,800
eats more salt than me

402
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,920
and takes more care than me.

403
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
What?

404
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Sir, I've checked the sugar.

405
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,800
The old sugar master has been ill for many years.

406
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
The sugar before has been changed to a shop.

407
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,800
I found the manager

408
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,240
who looked at the information of the steward.

409
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,440
Fortunately, the manager

410
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,720
saved the information.

411
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,800
This is the information

412
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,880
in the sugar.

413
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,160
What's it?

414
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,800
What does it say?

415
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,480
The main-line wounds.

416
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,840
Eh...

417
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,960
The story

418
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,000
in the 18 urns.

419
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Right, okay.

420
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,440
Soon.

421
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,680
OK.

422
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,840
That's good.

423
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,960
Actually, my dried tofu is not expensive.

424
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,520
Just give me two taels of silver.

425
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,280
If you pay me, I'll leave immediately.

426
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,520
But I'm tight-lipped.

427
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,080
Can you give me some silver first?

428
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
I couldn't sleep at night.

429
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,200
I asked others to get up and practice martial arts with him.

430
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,640
When fighting, one against three.

431
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
And beat the other person to the head.

432
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,120
Beat the head.

433
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,880
Why do you beat people?

434
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
I beat you.

435
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,520
When the food is the biggest,

436
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,360
one meal can eat 50,000 rice.

437
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,840
Three steamed buns.

438
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,480
Boss, one more bowl.

439
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,760
Okay.

440
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,920
It's exactly the same as when I was a kid.

441
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,280
Nothing has changed.

442
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,360
Besides,

443
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,920
you asked me to secretly investigate Yan Shi Fan's actions.

444
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
Compared to the past, there is nothing strange.

445
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,200
Only the same.

446
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,480
He sent someone to investigate the case of Xia Ran.

447
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,520
Xia Ran?

448
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,080
Why did he involve in the investigation?

449
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,240
Yan Shi Fan may be planning something again.

450
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,640
And he must have something to do with Xia Ran's case.

451
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,520
You send someone to follow him secretly.

452
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,920
See what he found.

453
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,960
And also,

454
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,680
find all the information about Xia Ran's case.

455
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,480
Yes.

456
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Yan Shi Fan

457
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,480
Madam Yuan.

458
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,840
Mr. Yi.

459
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,600
This is my daughter, Jin Xia.

460
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,080
Jin Xia, this is Mr. Yi.

461
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,360
Hello.

462
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
I have something to do.

463
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
You two talk first.

464
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,640
You talk so sweetly.

465
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
You are so funny.

466
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
Let's go.

467
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Mr. Yi.

468
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,880
Mr. Yi.

469
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,800
Madam Yuan, please sit.

470
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
You too.

471
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,920
Here.

472
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,040
You too.

473
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay.

474
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,480
Madam Yuan.

475
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,440
According to the custom of marriage,

476
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,000
we shouldn't meet here today.

477
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,920
But considering that my family is a family of scholars,

478
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
and I have a good reputation,

479
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,200
some rules...

480
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
Some rules...

481
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,440
We should make it clear before we enter the house.

482
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You say it.

483
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,040
If you enter my family,

484
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,080
you must be familiar with the female world.

485
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,880
You don't need to show up at the six gates of the house in the future.

486
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,520
Just stay at home.

487
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,520
I drank too much yesterday.

488
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
My head hurts.

489
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
Don't mind it.

490
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,920
No, no.

491
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,600
When will you serve the dishes? I'm starving.

492
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm starving.

493
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,920
Right away.

494
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,960
Xiao Er.

495
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,320
Serve the dishes.

496
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,520
Okay.

497
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,920
Sir, the dishes are ready.

498
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,800
Please enjoy.

499
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Let's eat.

500
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,160
I'm starving.

501
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
Slow down.

502
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,680
I'm starving.

503
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,080
Finish your bowl of absorbent soup.

504
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm so full.

505
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
I think you are disheartened now.

506
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,200
Eat it.

507
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,800
Why don't you eat it?

508
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,200
Do care about me.

509
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,160
You...

510
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,000
You have morals and ethics.

511
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,000
You are serious and put on aThis is a good »good€um anar work toward good Channel – Fashion – Fashion

512
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm not a good person.

513
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,920
If you say so,

514
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,520
it's not a bad thing.

515
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,880
You're a good person.

516
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,480
You're not a bad person.

517
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,160
You're a bad person.

518
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay.

519
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,680
It's okay.

520
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,240
You can learn the rules when you get married.

521
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,320
You're a good person.

522
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
You're a good person.

523
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,840
You're not humiliated enough.

524
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,480
You're a good person.

525
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,720
What good and what bad?

526
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,560
I...

527
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,960
I don't understand what you're saying.

528
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,400
Well,

529
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,320
Mr. Yi, are you really going to marry me?

530
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,480
I have to let you know something.

531
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,480
My hands

532
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,800
often break down some of my limbs.

533
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,080
My feet, too.

534
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,400
They often get wet.

535
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,480
Once,

536
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,280
I was so tired.

537
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,080
When I got home,

538
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,720
I didn't take off my clothes and didn't wash my face.

539
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,200
I just lay there and slept.

540
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,240
The next day, I woke up and you guess what happened.

541
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
There were insects all over the bed.

542
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,000
It's disgusting.

543
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,400
I feel so disgusting.

544
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,040
You asked me and Dayang

545
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,000
to pick out the insects inside.

546
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,200
We picked for two hours.

547
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,560
We couldn't eat for three days.

548
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,560
Sir,

549
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,640
listen to me.

550
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,880
The insects were in the blood.

551
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,880
They were white and fat.

552
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,040
They were still there.

553
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,320
They were still there.

554
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,400
I feel so disgusting.

555
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,920
Zifu,

556
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,120
go back to Zhenfu Temple.

557
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,040
I'll be back soon.

558
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,840
Yes, sir.

559
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,720
I'll be back soon.

560
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,640
But,

561
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,360
if Mr. Yi doesn't mind,

562
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,680
that's good.

563
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,280
Listen,

564
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,480
my mom always finds me a blind date.

565
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,360
When I told them about my job,

566
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
they all ran away.

567
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,720
I was so scared.

568
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,880
You're the first one who's calm.

569
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,080
You're the first one.

570
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,560
You have a bright future.

571
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,120
A woman's virtue

572
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,720
can't be punished.

573
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
But if you're sincere,

574
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,280
you should be careful.

575
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,680
As the old saying goes,

576
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,760
people are far away from disaster.

577
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm with people,

578
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,400
but I'm selfish.

579
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,040
I don't know why.

580
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,840
I think

581
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,560
our meeting

582
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
ends here.

583
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,200
Goodbye.

584
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Wait.

585
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,080
You're leaving?

586
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,160
What else?

587
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,600
You don't pay for this table of dishes.

588
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
I haven't eaten anything.

589
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,640
Why should I pay for it?

590
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,040
You invited me here.

591
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,240
You should pay for it.

592
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,000
Fine.

593
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,640
Even if you haven't eaten anything,

594
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
you can pay half of it.

595
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
You're making a scene.

596
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,840
Money.

597
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,280
This table of dishes

598
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,400
is not for me.

599
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,360
I didn't want to eat it.

600
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,920
But he won't want to marry me.

601
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,640
Fine.

602
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,920
I'll buy a happy meal

603
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,240
with the money.

604
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,360
Let's eat.

605
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,200
Sir.

606
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,280
Why are you here?

607
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,520
Just now...

608
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,880
I saw everything.

609
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,840
No.

610
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,120
You saw the fake.

611
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,560
I'm not usually like this.

612
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm not.

613
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,920
How many people

614
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,240
did you send away with this method?

615
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,880
My blind date?

616
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,840
I think it's a lot.

617
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,240
So many people.

618
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,640
You don't like them.

619
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
There are many people who like me.

620
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,920
I don't like them.

621
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,840
You just want to marry someone?

622
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,840
It depends on who I marry.

623
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,840
Who do you want to marry?

624
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,000
It's up to you.

625
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:35,240
You can 폭 with

626
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,040
OK.

627
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,880
OK.

628
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,400
What's the meaning?

629
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,360
I got it.

630
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,800
I can touch touch the pig Hospitals

631
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:13,480
Then make con塾

632
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,200
We thank Your Majesty

633
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,340
You give us so much plastic

634
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,740
Besides, the south and north forces are attacking the south and south.

635
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,020
They are robbing the roads.

636
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,380
Your Majesty, why not use the money from the treasury to buy the troops?

637
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,180
The Fujian region is still in a state of chaos.

638
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,580
The construction of Zhai Xing Temple is very expensive.

639
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,180
I'm afraid that the treasury cannot be supported.

640
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,860
It cannot be supported?

641
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,140
What?

642
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,940
I've built a Taoist temple,

643
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,140
and you're talking about the treasury?

644
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,620
Your Majesty, please calm down.

645
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,180
I just have a big news.

646
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,140
Your Majesty, I have a suggestion.

647
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,260
Tell me.

648
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,140
Now the court is relying on your good conduct.

649
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,300
The state is in peace and the situation is smooth.

650
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,260
The people are paying tribute every year.

651
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,380
I've been a minister for twenty years.

652
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,500
I only know that I'm a traitor.

653
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,340
I've never heard of building a Taoist temple.

654
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,620
I would even build a treasury.

655
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,700
You're being sarcastic, Your Majesty.

656
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,860
Chief Ning.

657
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,140
I'm here.

658
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,380
Tell me.

659
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,980
Should I build a Taoist temple or not?

660
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,780
Your Majesty, it's up to you.

661
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,940
Building a Taoist temple is a matter of the Ministry of Works.

662
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,060
Minister of Works.

663
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,740
I'm here.

664
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,820
Tell me.

665
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,780
Should I build a Taoist temple or not?

666
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,380
Your Majesty, of course you should build it.

667
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,100
But the Ministry of Works has built 13 temples this year.

668
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,460
It's already spent 11 million taels.

669
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,420
There are still many places that haven't been completed yet.

670
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,660
I'm afraid that we'll have to wait until the end of the month to build it.

671
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,300
After the end of the month?

672
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,340
What if I have to start working before the end of the year?

673
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,380
We will do our best.

674
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,180
Your Majesty.

675
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,980
This is the location I chose for the Taoist temple.

676
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,500
To the south west is the Taiye Lake,

677
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,340
which is located on the back of Wan Shou Mountain.

678
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,020
Your Majesty, please look.

679
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,700
When the Taoist temple is completed,

680
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,580
it will look like this.

681
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,380
Good.

682
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,820
You're really a man of great achievement.

683
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,380
Once the Taoist temple is completed,

684
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,980
I will reward you with great honor.

685
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

686
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,140
But where did the money from the Ming Empire's treasury go?

687
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,660
Could it have gone into someone else's pocket?

688
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,700
Li Fang.

689
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,900
I'm here.

690
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,780
Tell me.

691
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,860
I'm afraid. I don't know.

692
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,380
You're so scared.

693
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,980
Go.

694
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,580
I'll just pretend that you don't know.

695
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Hey.

696
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,500
To govern a country,

697
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,180
you have to be like the Taoist priest.

698
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,180
You have to know how to balance.

699
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,180
Only when you have both good and bad,

700
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,780
can you be safe and sound.

701
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,900
Your Majesty, I don't know why,

702
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,500
but I want the Taoist temple to be completed immediately.

703
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,700
Since we have done this job,

704
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,980
we have to do it well.

705
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,980
We can't let Your Majesty down.

706
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,780
You don't have to worry.

707
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,180
I'll arrange for the transport of the people and horses.

708
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,180
I'll transport the materials to the capital.

709
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,380
I'll let Your Majesty build the Taoist temple.

710
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,380
The transport is your business.

711
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,980
Do it as you please.

712
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,780
I won't let you down.

713
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,980
This is the silver needle that His Majesty bestowed.

714
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,980
There are ten of them in total.

715
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,780
I and Yan Ge Lao each got two.

716
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,580
I didn't have the heart to use them.

717
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,580
Only the distinguished guests took them out.

718
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,180
About the court this morning,

719
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,780
you've already known about it, right?

720
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,380
About the construction of the new temple.

721
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
It's okay.

722
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,580
You informed me about His Majesty's intention in advance.

723
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,980
I know how to respond.

724
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,980
You sold me out in advance.

725
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,380
I'm afraid you have other wishes.

726
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,980
I want you to know that

727
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,380
I'm only trying to help you.

728
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,380
What do you know about my plan?

729
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,980
To be honest,

730
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,580
I'm like you.

731
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,180
I have the intention to commit crimes.

732
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,980
Otherwise, how could I recommend Lan Qing Xuan to you?

733
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,580
When Lan Qing Xuan entered the palace,

734
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,780
I still thank you for your effort.

735
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,980
I received your letter.

736
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,180
I have questions in my heart.

737
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,980
But I never had the chance to ask you.

738
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,580
The Lu family never fights against the party.

739
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,780
Your father is even closer to the Yan family.

740
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,980
How did you get into this trouble?

741
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,780
Everyone has their own will.

742
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,180
I only believe in the evil and the righteous.

743
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,980
My father has his own thoughts.

744
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,380
It doesn't mean I have my own position.

745
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,180
I'm not talented,

746
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,380
but I can help you.

747
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
If you don't believe me,

748
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,180
just pretend that I've never been here.

749
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,580
This road is very dangerous.

750
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,380
You're using your great future to block it.

751
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,780
If you win,

752
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,180
you won't have much benefit.

753
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,780
But if you lose,

754
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,980
the whole Lu family will be ruined by you.

755
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,980
You must think it over.

756
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,780
Sir, I'm willing to take a step back.

757
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,380
The tea in the court is like the cup of tea in my hand.

758
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,380
The tea is valuable because it has three different tastes.

759
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,580
You thought it was going to be too heavy.

760
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,380
But it will be too heavy.

761
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,780
Like Yu Dayong,

762
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,180
he has done many things for others,

763
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,980
but he can also do many things for himself.

764
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,980
For example, the repair of the zhenxing temple.

765
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,580
The Ministry of Revenue is against it.

766
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,380
Why?

767
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,980
The Ministry of Revenue doesn't have money to repair it.

768
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,380
But the civil and military affairs of the whole court,

769
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,180
who can get it?

770
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,380
Only the Yan family.

771
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,780
This morning, His Majesty wanted to let Yan family get some blood.

772
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,380
So he did the repair of the zhenxing temple.

773
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,580
I didn't expect you to know His Majesty's mind so well.

774
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,980
I've served His Majesty for a long time.

775
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,580
I can understand a little.

776
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,580
His Majesty is suspicious.

777
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,780
He asked the imperial guard to supervise the repair of the zhenxing temple.

778
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,580
Why did His Majesty care about this so much?

779
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,780
He said that His Majesty already has feelings for the Yan family.

780
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,980
This is a good sign.

781
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,980
But to completely overthrow the Yan family,

782
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
there is still a long way to go.

783
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,380
We must not rush it.

784
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,780
I understand.

785
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,180
His Majesty knows the way.

786
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,380
Besides, the Yan family has been in power for over 20 years.

787
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,980
We can only leave the Yan family behind.

788
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,980
Then we can get the Yan family back.

789
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,180
This is a battle of the stars.

790
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,580
The point is to shake His Majesty's trust in the Yan family.

791
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,380
Yan's Manor

792
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Senior Brother, return the letter to me.

793
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,780
I won't return it. Let me see who wrote it.

794
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,980
Yang Yue wrote it?

795
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,180
I didn't expect that this stupid brain can move so fast.

796
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,380
Don't make trouble.

797
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,180
Who made trouble? I just wanted to take a look.

798
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,980
My injury has already healed a lot.

799
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,180
Why hasn't this guy come to propose to you yet?

800
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,380
Tell me. What is it?

801
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,780
Senior Sister knows me better.

802
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,780
It's like this. A few days ago, my father took over a business in the capital.

803
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,780
He said that he wanted to take the opportunity to develop the capital's transportation.

804
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,780
That's good. It's good to train yourself.

805
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,580
That's right. My father also said that.

806
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
It's just...

807
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,380
What is it?

808
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,580
It's just that he's worried that I'll go alone.

809
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,580
He said that the transportation in the capital is very important.

810
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,380
So he wants you to go with me.

811
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
Capital?

812
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,580
I think that Senior Sister has already taken over the head of Zhu Que Hall.

813
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,780
But she's still a member of our Wu An Gang.

814
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,780
Senior Sister, you must help me with this.

815
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,180
Also, isn't Yang Yue also in the capital?

816
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,380
Don't fight with me. Even if Yang Yue isn't in the capital,

817
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,380
I will still take you along with me on this trip.

818
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,980
It's just that we are going to the capital to develop the stronghold.

819
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,580
We can't avoid dealing with the capital's officials.

820
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,780
The Yan family is now in a tight spot.

821
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,980
It's almost impossible to get around them.

822
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,180
You want me to go to Xie Xiao to collude with Yan Shi Fan?

823
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,780
He's dreaming.

824
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,380
Then should we do this business or not?

825
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,380
Of course, we must do the business. It's a matter of course, right?

826
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,980
Senior Sister, don't worry. I won't make any trouble.

827
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,380
Also, I can still meet Jin Xia and the others this time.

828
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,380
Okay.

829
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,780
Father.

830
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,580
Look.

831
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,380
The mantis is hunting the cicada, the yellow bird is behind it.

832
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,180
Your little smarty-pants still can't even fight them.

833
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,380
This memorial is just a test to see how His Majesty treats our Lu family.

834
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,580
Fortunately, His Majesty only asked a few questions and didn't ask for a detailed explanation.

835
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,980
He also didn't ask for the person who submitted the memorial.

836
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,380
You should still be more mature in doing things.

837
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,380
When you mentioned Wu Shou Xu, you gave him a white paper.

838
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,180
Many people were impressed by it.

839
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,980
It's best to clear the boundaries with Wu Shou Xu.

840
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,380
I didn't really use Wu Shou Xu.

841
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,780
The lighter one is lighter, the lighter one is lighter.

842
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,980
Why bother to be polite?

843
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,380
Of course, that's good.

844
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,780
His Majesty just ordered me to send someone to take Yu Dayong back to the capital.

845
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,780
Why?

846
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,780
The censor impeached Wu Shou Xu to be a traitor to the Fujian dynasty.

847
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,780
Yu Dayong is from Quanzhou.

848
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,180
Wu Shou Xu then put all his responsibilities on him.

849
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,580
His Majesty was furious and ordered to arrest Yu Dayong.

850
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,380
Arrest Yu Dayong?

851
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,980
Father, you clearly know that Yu Dayong is determined to fight.

852
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,180
Why didn't you speak up for him?

853
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,380
If I speak up for him now, will His Majesty still trust us?

854
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,180
Then you can't just judge it by its appearance.

855
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,380
Just like Huang Yu, he clearly knew that Yan Shi Fan would frame him.

856
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,780
I told you that the criminal Pan Jiakou Changcheng was a spy.

857
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,580
He was arrested for five days to prove the truth.

858
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,780
Father, this case is very serious.

859
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,980
Yan Shi Fan is angry with Huang Yu.

860
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,780
He deliberately made this case very serious.

861
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,380
Father, you can make him smaller.

862
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,980
I know that you and Yu Dayong have a very close relationship. You want to save him.

863
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,780
But have you ever thought about why someone suddenly impeached him?

864
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,180
I know that Yan Shi Fan set this up.

865
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,380
You know? You know that you still can't hold it in and save him?

866
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,980
You are simply looking for death.

867
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,380
Do you think that Yan Shi Fan is only targeting you?

868
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,580
He wants the whole Lu family.

869
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,380
If you run to Yu Dayong now, someone will jump out immediately.

870
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,980
It's a big deal to fight with you to get the edge.

871
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,780
By then, no one can save us.

872
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,580
Since I have already decided to fight against Yan family,

873
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,380
I have already thought of a solution.

874
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,980
I will think of a way to get Yu Dayong. I will never drag father into this.

875
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,780
Do you think that your life is not big enough?

876
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,180
I have always admired Yu Dayong.

877
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,780
I can't just watch him suffer.

878
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,380
You are the Imperial Guards. Don't forget your identity.

879
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,380
Imperial Guards?

880
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,980
Since the first day I entered the Beizhen Office,

881
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,380
you have been teaching me to tell me that the duty of the Imperial Guards is to punish the evildoers.

882
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:28,580
Until today, there are still four words on the door of the Beizhen Office.

883
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:34,580
It's just that I don't understand where the loyalty and the loyalty are in your eyes.

884
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,180
Do you still remember the Shen Lian?

885
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,180
Jin Yi was the Shen Lian of Jingli and he was sent to Anzhou.

886
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:46,180
He was once his brother, but he was afraid of Yan family and didn't help them.

887
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,380
In the end, he was badly harmed.

888
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,980
The head of the Ministry of Revenue is Yang Qizheng.

889
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,380
Because he impeached Yan family, he was framed and jailed.

890
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,180
After Yan Xing was beaten, he was killed.

891
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,180
And the old servant...

892
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,780
Stop talking!
