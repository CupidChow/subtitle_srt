00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ah

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ah

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ah

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ah

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ah

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ah

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Your wound hasn't healed yet

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't move

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You saved me

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was hunting on the mountain that day

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I found you still have a breath

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So I carried you back

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ah

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thanks for saving me

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll come back to thank you another day

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't move

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Where are you going?

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
My friend is still waiting for me there

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have to go back

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't move

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your current body

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's impossible to get out of this door

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You'd better wait

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Until the wound is healed

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ah

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Want to get better soon

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Drink the medicine

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Come

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Take it

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why thank you

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Lie down and rest

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Ah

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Dad

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Dad

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm back, dad

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Son

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Dad

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How is it?

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I didn't make it hard for you, right?

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Congratulations

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Congratulations to the second young master

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If Miss Min knew

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
She would be very happy

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Finally, she didn't sacrifice for nothing

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My sister really paid a lot for me this time

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When my sister comes back

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I will thank her

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Min has been good since childhood

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
She is the great benefactor of our Chunyu family

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's said that the daughter who married out

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The water that spills out

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It turns out that Miss Min became an outsider so quickly

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Miss Yuan

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What do you mean by this?

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Since ancient times, the husband marries the wife

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
My sister married Sima Chang'an

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Of course she is from the Sima family

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's say something bad

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Even if one day my sister is dead

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What is written on the tomb

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's also Sima Chunyu

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That is naturally not from our Chunyu family

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I understand

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
In your eyes

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The daughter's family is just a commodity for exchange for profit

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Chunyu Min has your parents

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No wonder the character will be distorted

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I feel so sorry for her

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What are you talking about?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Women are supposed to compensate for the past

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have always been a quick-tempered person

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I didn't mean to offend you

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Please don't blame me

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why did you hit me?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I hit you

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So many things happened in the mansion recently

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think uncle and aunt should be quiet

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We will start to observe from tomorrow

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't disturb me

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If uncle has anything

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can come to me anytime

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sir, don't you think they are too much?

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Since the second young master came back

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Everyone seems to forget Chunyu Min

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The son who exchanged for the daughter

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why is it so reasonable?

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Especially that Chunyu Qi

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A face that looks down on women

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Really make people proud

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then you can't just be a man

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't forget

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are a compensator

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Not a hero who sees injustice

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I was wrong

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Where is the mistake?

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Rude

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because of the moment

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's embarrassing

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will remember in the future

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you want to hit someone again

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I will find a time to get over it

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Solve them secretly

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Leaving Chunyu Mansion

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not because of your relationship

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We have been here for a while

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And don't need to hide our identity

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Staying here

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's easy to drag them down

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sir, don't explain

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I understand

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You are so indifferent to Chunyu Min

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't you hate him?

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Although my family is poor

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But my mother treats me very well

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If one day there is a bad dad

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To force a marriage

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
My mother must be hit to death

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Won't hand me over

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So I feel sorry for her

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are so kind

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't dare to say that

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Although I don't hate him

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But I have to take the revenge

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
To complain and to get back what you have

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's always my duty

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Ok, let's clean up

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I will move to Guanyin tomorrow

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sir

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sir

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I have found out that

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The two girls that Mr. Yan married

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are all in Guanyin

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They are related

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They are related to a piece of land

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And this land is close to the horse farm of Chunyu family

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I will go and have a look

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will go too

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I didn't expect that the criminal would die like this

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's destiny

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Now it seems

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sister's daughter is in danger

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Brother Yang

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Except the criminal

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't know what happened

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Except the criminal

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There is no other clue?

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's ok

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There is still a chance

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How about this

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's ask Brother Yang

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
To deal with his son Yang Yue first

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And then find the clue

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know what happened to Yang Yue

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You will know when you see him later

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ling

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your identity is special now

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You should be low-key

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's find a place to stay first

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And ask about their whereabouts

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You see

187
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I got the news that

188
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They live in Chunyu family in Hangzhou

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How about

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We go there now

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Do as Brother Yang said

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hurry up

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hurry up

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hurry up

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hurry up

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Be careful

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hurry up

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Move your stuff

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Move your stuff

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hurry up

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Move it

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hurry up

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is the land of Chunyu family

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The land of the west bank of the Ma Chang

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The young master has been worried about it for a long time

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There should be no mistake

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Otherwise

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That Gao Ge, Ai Ge

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I saw it in Sima mansion

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They said this land is very important

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yan Shi Fan has been worried about it for years

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hurry up

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hurry up

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sir

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What are they doing?

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The area of the south of the Yangtze River

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is the capital of the Eastern Han

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It has a lot of land

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And the technology is very advanced

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It should be a mine

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
A mine?

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If it is a mine

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's hard to calculate the profit

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It doesn't count

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hurry up

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Sir

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yan Shi Fan

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Good

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The ore that was dug here

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
From color to texture

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Is better than other places

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Sir

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The sugar that was made from this ore

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is more delicate and tough than before

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Is that all?

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because there are not many ore

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So we can only get these

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yan Feng

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Sir

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Add more people

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Add more people

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And also the iron mine we found

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We need to save the production

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes, sir

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I will tell them

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's send the goods first

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You guys, get the car

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hurry up

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Hurry up

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Hurry up

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I will send you guys here

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Be careful on the road

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's go

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Go

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Sir

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Who are you?

265
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You didn't ask me

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I asked you

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What's in the cave?

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I will kill you if you don't tell me

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let me tell you

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
One is the mine

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The other is the field

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Tan Huang is the one who made it

273
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What else do you know?

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tell me

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
My ancestors

277
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Have been mining iron mines for the court

278
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They have been working in the mines for years

279
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So they are very good at mining

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They are very good at mining

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
A few years ago, Mr. Sima caught me

282
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And forced me to find the mine for him

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mr. Sima

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You still don't know

285
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There is a mine here

286
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why doesn't the court know?

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's not easy to find the mine

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There are some hidden mines

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Even if you dig it up, you may not find it

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If it wasn't for my ancestors

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
They have been mining in the mines for years

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They have accumulated a lot of experience

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They have learned how to find the mines

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How can they find it here?

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But there are many iron mines in the underground

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But they are separated by the mountain

297
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They are divided into three parts of the east and west

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I know

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I know why Sima Chang'an

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Married those women

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because they will be assigned

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
A dowry for the family

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And in these dowries

304
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There is a land with iron mines

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The mine can't be mined by private people

306
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Especially iron mines

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Once it is found

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's a big crime to kill

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Plus

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The families with three land

311
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Have a lot of experience

312
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So they can't occupy the land

313
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And they can't buy land

314
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So in order to cover up

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He has found a way to get married

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It took him years

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
To collect all the land, right?

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes

319
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He is so bold

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He dares to steal the iron mines

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Take him back

322
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes

323
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Mr. Lu

324
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You are so capable

325
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This place is so hidden

326
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And it's heavily guarded

327
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How did you get in?

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was under the order of the court

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And I met Yan Shi by accident

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Accident?

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Where is Hong Gui?

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You two

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Were on the mountain

334
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And you were watching me

335
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I have found it

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You were watching me

337
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I have found it

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't do evil things

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't fear the evil

340
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Then I want to ask you

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What did I do?

342
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I need you and the six gates

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
To follow me

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And investigate me

345
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You are pretending?

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You are...

347
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What?

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What?

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Little girl

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why are you so fierce

351
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
When you see me now?

352
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I remember

353
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You were wearing

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A red wedding dress

355
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And lying on my wedding bed

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You were so pitiful

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It was really...

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It was really

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So embarrassing

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Stop it

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Shameless

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why are you scolding me?

363
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay, I won't say it

364
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't want to make you angry

365
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I am not angry

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Since you didn't do anything bad

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Can we leave now?

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yan Feng

370
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
See Mr. Lu off

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes

372
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Young master

373
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I didn't say anything

374
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay

376
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Sir

377
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yan Shifan

378
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think he knows

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We are investigating him

380
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And he is secretly opening the gate

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He is not the one

382
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know

383
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't know

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know

385
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I think he knows

386
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We are investigating him

387
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And he is secretly opening the gate

388
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If we want to investigate him again

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It will be hard

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I know

391
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What are you thinking?

392
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I am thinking

393
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
In the future, such a dangerous thing

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can't take you with me

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Medical scholar

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
"- Sir.- Guard

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Guard

398
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
저 여기서

399
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,400
Senior Sister!

400
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,760
Young Master Yang!

401
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,640
Young Master Yang!

402
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,520
Young Master Yang!

403
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,120
Young Master Yang!

404
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,160
Master!

405
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,280
Master is there!

406
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
Senior Sister!

407
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Senior Sister!

408
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,000
Senior Sister!

409
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,080
Hurry!

410
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,800
Senior Sister!

411
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,640
Great!

412
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,720
I finally found you!

413
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
What's wrong with you?

414
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,680
Are you hurt?

415
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Where is Yang Yue?

416
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Yang Yue...

417
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
What's wrong?

418
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Senior Sister!

419
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Are you okay?

420
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
According to what you said,

421
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Yang Yue and Dong Qisheng fell off the cliff together,

422
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,720
but you didn't find his body.

423
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,360
Since you didn't find his body,

424
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
there's a chance of survival.

425
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Senior Sister,

426
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,800
you're too weak now.

427
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,480
Let me send you back to the Wu An Gang.

428
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,960
I'll let my brothers continue to find him.

429
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,360
Let's go.

430
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
Come on.

431
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Be careful.

432
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,360
Qi, eat more.

433
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,680
Yang, eat more.

434
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,440
Father, you too.

435
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Eat more.

436
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,840
Look at you, you're so thin.

437
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,800
Yes, I've been so thin.

438
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Eat more.

439
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
Father, mother,

440
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
second brother.

441
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,760
My poor daughter.

442
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,880
Why didn't you say anything when you came back?

443
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,360
Dong Po Meat,

444
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,360
Eight Treasures Tofu,

445
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,360
Longjing Shrimp,

446
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
West Lake Fish,

447
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Guihua Freshly-cooked Soup.

448
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,680
You eat so well.

449
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,160
I thought I was marrying Lord Yan.

450
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Madam,

451
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Madam,

452
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,440
we have to go back early.

453
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,880
I thought I was marrying Sima Chang'an.

454
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,840
You must be in a dilemma

455
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,640
in your family.

456
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,600
You unfilial daughter,

457
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
what are you talking about?

458
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,720
What's wrong with father?

459
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,400
How can father give his daughter

460
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
an unfilial charge?

461
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Sister,

462
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
look, our father is old now.

463
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,520
He's not so strong.

464
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
You'd better be careful.

465
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
If father gets angry,

466
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,040
it'll be your fault.

467
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,840
Second brother is getting more obedient.

468
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,240
Why didn't I see

469
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
you were so good?

470
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,320
For you,

471
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,160
I've spent my whole life

472
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,560
with women.

473
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
You should think about

474
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
what I've done

475
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,280
for you and your family.

476
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
What are you doing?

477
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
I tell you,

478
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
you can't take it off now.

479
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
If you don't take care of it,

480
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
the wound will become stronger.

481
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Your face will be ruined.

482
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Please tell me,

483
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
I'm not a good person.

484
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
I'm not a good person.

485
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm not a good person.

486
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm not a good person.

487
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm not a good person.

488
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I'm not a good person.

489
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Tell me,

490
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
how's my wound?

491
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Is it serious?

492
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Can it be cured?

493
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
No one can say

494
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
before the wound is healed.

495
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
But I tell you,

496
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
if you keep doing this,

497
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
your wound will never get better.

498
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
No matter how good a doctor

499
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
or medicine is,

500
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
it's useless.

501
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Alright.

502
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Eat your meal.

503
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm going to the hospital.

504
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
I'll be back soon.

505
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
I'll be back soon.

506
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
I'll be back soon.

507
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
I'll be back soon.

508
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
I'll be back soon.

509
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
I'll be back soon.

510
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
I'll be back soon.

511
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
I'll be back soon.

512
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
I'll be back soon.

513
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
I'll be back soon.

514
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
I'll be back soon.

515
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
I'll be back soon.

516
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I'll be back soon.

517
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I'll be back soon.

518
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
I'll be back soon.

519
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I'll be back soon.

520
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
I'll be back soon.

521
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
I'll be back soon.

522
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I'll be back soon.

523
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
I'll be back soon.

524
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
I'll be back soon.

525
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I'll be back soon.

526
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
I'll be back soon.

527
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
I'll be back soon.

528
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I'll be back soon.

529
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I'll be back soon.

530
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Hello.

531
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:18,160
My uncle, чё

532
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,820
Channel 8?

533
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,280
map

534
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
100

535
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
champions

536
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Raise my eyes

537
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Over our hearts

538
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Settle our sorrows

539
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Many enemies

540
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Have died

541
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
in sorrow

542
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm afraid that Jinxia is worried, so I didn't tell her.

543
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
It's time to tell her.

544
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Maybe, with her tracking skills,

545
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
she can find someone soon.

546
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Okay. I'll tell her tomorrow.

547
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Let's see if she has any good idea.

548
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Lu Yi's Mansion

549
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
It's troublesome.

550
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Now, Lu Yi knows that I'm mining.

551
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
He will definitely tell His Majesty.

552
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I'll send someone to stop Lu Yi's secret message.

553
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Lu Yi and His Majesty's communication

554
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
has a secret channel.

555
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
What's wrong with you?

556
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
Go.

557
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,280
Find someone to replace Sima Chang'an.

558
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Clean up all the evidence that I showed.

559
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Don't leave any trace.

560
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
And, inform Zhai Lan Yan

561
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,280
to handle the mining.

562
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Yes, Young Master.

563
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Young Master.

564
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
When Chun Yu Min returned to Ning last time,

565
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,280
he might have exposed his identity.

566
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
I'm afraid that people from Chun Yu Mansion

567
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
will catch him.

568
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
I'll find someone to stop him.

569
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Or I'll kill them all.

570
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Keep it.

571
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
It's boring to kill them.

572
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Yes, Young Master.

573
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Yan Shi Fan's Mansion

574
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Sir.

575
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Yan Shi Fan will not let us off this time.

576
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,280
There are things that we have to find out sooner or later.

577
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Even if I don't find out his secret,

578
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
he won't let me off.

579
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Have you already got a way to deal with Yan Shi Fan?

580
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Not Yan Shi Fan himself.

581
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,280
I just opened up Sima Chang'an.

582
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,280
And I've also fixed the situation of Tan Huang.

583
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
But,

584
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Yan Shi Fan and Sima Chang'an are artists.

585
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
We don't have any evidence.

586
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
We can't prove it.

587
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
We have evidence.

588
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
I can prove it.

589
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
No.

590
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
You can't get involved.

591
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
I can't let you get involved.

592
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Of course, there's danger.

593
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
I'm not afraid.

594
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
I'll face it with you.

595
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,280
You and I will only drag me down.

596
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I'll face it myself.

597
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
It'll be easier.

598
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Then let me drag you down.

599
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
What?

600
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
You don't listen to me anymore?

601
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
You should be good.

602
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,280
You can do whatever I say.

603
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Move aside!

604
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Stop!

605
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
What's going on?

606
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Behave yourself!

607
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Stop talking nonsense!

608
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Hurry!

609
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Turn around!

610
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
What happened?

611
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,280
The husband and wife are in the same forest.

612
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,280
The big trouble is coming.

613
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I'm saying,

614
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,280
my husband just got into trouble.

615
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Are you going to leave me and leave?

616
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
You...

617
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Let me go.

618
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
I don't know anything.

619
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
I'm sorry.

620
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
I'm sorry.

621
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,280
I dare not reveal your identity.

622
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Of course, you dare not.

623
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
But from now on,

624
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,280
there's no Sima Chang'an in Hangzhou.

625
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,280
It's all Bai Lu Yi's doing.

626
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
You're his cousin.

627
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,280
What should I do to you?

628
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Wait!

629
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Young Master!

630
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
I have a way to help you.

631
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
As long as you don't kill me...

632
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Okay.

633
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Tell me.

634
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I'm telling you,

635
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,280
you won't let go of the person who offended you.

636
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
If you leave me,

637
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I'll become your horse and go to fight against Lu Yi.

638
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,280
A little imperial guard, Lu Qian Shi.

639
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,280
If I didn't want to give him a little face,

640
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
I would have killed him.

641
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Do I need you to help me deal with him?

642
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Lu Yi,

643
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,280
if you really say so,

644
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,280
then you should still be in that Sima Manor,

645
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,280
playing the ugly monster.

646
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Okay, okay.

647
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Go on.

648
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Even if you can kill Lu Yi easily,

649
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,280
are you willing to let him go so easily?

650
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
That's right.

651
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Killing someone is simple and rough.

652
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
I don't like it.

653
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
It's not my style.

654
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,280
If I can find a way to win his heart,

655
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,280
and make him suffer for the rest of his life,

656
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
that's my style.

657
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,280
You mean Yuan Jin Xia?

658
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,280
You're really my sidekick.

659
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
We have a connection.

660
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Okay, I'll give you this chance.

661
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
But before that,

662
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,280
I have to test you first.

663
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Okay.

664
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
I'll go.

665
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Mister, what are you doing?

666
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
You'll know when you get in.

667
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Let's go.

668
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Mi'er.

669
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Miss.

670
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Mister, only a few of them were there.

671
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,280
I thought I married Master Yan.

672
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Madam, we have to go back earlier.

673
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
You... who are you?

674
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
What's going on?

675
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Your daughter made me angry.

676
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,280
What should I do?

677
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
You're the one who killed them.

678
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
It's up to you.

679
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Did you hear that?

680
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,280
Your father said it's up to me.

681
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
What do you think I should do?

682
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Didn't you say you wanted me to spare your life

683
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
to deal with Lu Yi?

684
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Here.

685
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Take it.

686
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Take it.

687
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Let me see how brave you are.

688
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Okay?

689
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
No.

690
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Go to her.

691
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Go. Kill her.

692
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
No, Miss.

693
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
No.

694
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
No, Miss.

695
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Don't kill me.

696
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Go.

697
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Let me go.

698
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,280
I'm your personal guardian.

699
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Don't kill me.

700
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Useless.

701
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
How dare you?

702
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,280
What's the use of me keeping you by my side?

703
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Miss.

704
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
No.

705
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Please.

706
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Don't kill me.

707
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Hurry up.

708
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Miss, I beg you.

709
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Don't kill me.

710
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Go. Help her.

711
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
No.

712
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
No.

713
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
Miss.

714
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
I didn't kill her.

715
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
I didn't kill her.

716
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
You killed her.

717
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
We all saw it.

718
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Yes.

719
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
You did well.

720
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Come on. Get up.

721
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Let's see who we should kill next.

722
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
No.

723
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Take it.

724
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Come on.

725
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
She.

726
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
No.

727
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
No.

728
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
No.

729
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Miss, I'm wrong.

730
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Don't do this to me.

731
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Miss, I'm wrong.

732
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
I'm wrong.

733
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Miss.

734
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
I'm wrong.

735
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
I'm wrong.

736
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Miss.

737
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Miss.

738
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
They don't know me.

739
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,280
But I still have Chunyi's blood.

740
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
I can't lose my wife.

741
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Miss.

742
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Miss, I beg you.

743
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Please let them go.

744
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
I can do anything.

745
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Miss.

746
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
You're moving.

747
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Okay.

748
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,280
I can help you.

749
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
How about this?

750
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,280
If you're calm today,

751
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
I'll let them go.

752
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
I can give them three lives.

753
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
It's worth it.

754
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
No.

755
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
I can't die.

756
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
I don't want to die.

757
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
You don't want to die?

758
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Min.

759
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Min.

760
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
I beg you.

761
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Please save your wife and son's lives.

762
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Please help us Chunyu's family.

763
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Miss.

764
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I'll die for her.

765
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
No.

766
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Dad.

767
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Stop him.

768
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Dad.

769
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Master.

770
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Dad.

771
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Master.

772
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Dad.

773
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Master.

774
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Dad.

775
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Master.

776
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Go.

777
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Go.

778
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Dad.

779
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Master.

780
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Dad.

781
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Dad.

782
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
No.

783
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
I don't want to die.

784
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
You bastards.

785
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
You can't die.

786
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
Min.

787
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Min.

788
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Dad, let me go.

789
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
No.

790
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
No.

791
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
Mom.

792
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Mom.

793
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Mom.

794
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Not bad.

795
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Come on.

796
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Get up.

797
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Good.

798
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,280
I like smart and obedient women.

799
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
You should know.

800
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
It's because your cousin Lu Yi.

801
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,280
He didn't want to save you to save Yuan Jinxia.

802
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
You should hate him.

803
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Right?

804
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,280
He is the one who made all these things.

805
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
And you should remember.

806
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Now you can only deal with that Lu Yi.

807
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
To solve your hatred.

808
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
You should be obedient.

809
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

810
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Yan Feng, deal with him.

811
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Yes.

812
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
What did you see?

813
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,280
The coal quality is much better than the one you got.

814
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,280
It means the quality of the ore in the mine is not ordinary.

815
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
You mean...

816
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,280
If the ore produced in the mine is used on the fire.

817
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,280
The power of the fire will be much better.

818
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
The iron mine is so powerful.

819
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
It can't be used on the mine.

820
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
It will be rewarded.

821
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
It's not a big deal.

822
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
It's a crime to make weapons.

823
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,280
How can Yan Shi Fan do that?

824
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Don't forget.

825
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
He is the elder brother.

826
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
He can do that.

827
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
As long as it's not on the table.

828
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,280
His majesty will never know.

829
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Right.

830
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,280
No one is afraid of Yan family except his majesty.

831
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Even your family Lu will be forced to do that.

832
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Sir.

833
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,280
If I sell these to the magic camp.

834
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Will it be a big profit?

835
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
In your eyes.

836
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,280
You have other things besides money.

837
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Jin Xia.

838
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Jin Xia.

839
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
I want to tell you something.

840
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
But don't be too anxious after you hear it.

841
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
What?

842
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Senior sister has found it.

843
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Really?

844
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
That's great.

845
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
But...

846
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
What?

847
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
But Yang Yue fell off the cliff.

848
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,280
We haven't found him yet.

849
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
What?

850
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Where is the cliff?

851
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Take me there.

852
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Go.

853
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Go.

854
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Sir.

855
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Bad news.

856
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
What?

857
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Something happened in Chunyun's family.

858
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
Something happened?

859
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
So cruel.

860
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
Who did this?

861
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Who did this?

862
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Sir.

863
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
I just checked.

864
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
The whole Chunyun's family didn't leave any clues.

865
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Buy some good coffins.

866
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
And take the body.

867
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
I'll go now.

868
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Wait.

869
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Where is Min?

870
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Sima's mansion has been sealed.

871
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Send someone to find Min's whereabouts.

872
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Tell him about Chunyun's family.

873
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Yes.

874
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Yes.

875
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
We've been looking for so long.

876
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Why didn't we find anything?

877
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Did Yang Yue come here?

878
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Xie Xiao.

879
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,280
When did Dayang fall off the cliff?

880
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
A few days ago.

881
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

882
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
I was afraid you would worry.

883
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I hope I can find some clues.

884
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Since sister Shangguan said

885
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Dayang fell off the cliff.

886
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
If he didn't disappear in the air,

887
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
he must be around here.

888
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
But we've been looking for so long.

889
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
No matter what happened,

890
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
there must be some traces.

891
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Did you find anything?

892
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
This is a man's footprint.

893
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
This shoe is wider than other shoes.

894
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
There are finger prints on the sole.

895
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
The size of the finger prints is different.

896
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,280
It looks like a rough wood-like shoe.

897
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
From the depth of this footprint,

898
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
this person must be heavily pregnant.

899
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
You mean...

900
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
If I'm not wrong,

901
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Dayang must be rescued by the nearby villagers.

902
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Let's go find him.

903
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Let's go.

904
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Sir, Miss Min is here.

905
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Min.

906
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Big brother.

907
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Big brother.

908
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Why are you here?

909
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Sima Mansion has been sealed.

910
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
With my current identity,

911
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Chunyu's family will definitely not be able to go back.

912
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Something happened in Chunyu's Mansion.

913
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
What?

914
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
What did you say about my family?

915
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
There are more than a dozen people in Chunyu's Mansion.

916
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
They were killed last night.

917
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
This is not me.

918
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
This is not me.

919
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
No!

920
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Why?

921
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Why?

922
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,280
Why?

923
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,280
Why?

924
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,280
Why?

925
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,280
Why?

926
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Why?

927
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
Why?

928
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,280
Why?

929
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,280
Why?

930
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,280
Why?

931
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
Why?

932
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,280
Why?

933
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,280
Why?

934
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
Why?

935
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Why?

936
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
in one's race

937
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:14,220
in a

938
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,280
The Long Ballad

939
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Episode 18
