I've lost lots of travel experience

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
as before

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hana, how did I know that

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Go back again

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hana, how did I know that

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hana, I've lost lots of travel experience

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not done yet!

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,720
He's the thief who stole the ball!

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm going to get him back!

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Are you coming or not?

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Hit him here!

59
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,440
Eat the real thing slowly,

60
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
and come for him.

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,880
We two,

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
husband and wife,

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
have never done anything wrong.

64
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,400
Brother Sha was caught this time

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,600
because I didn't like the father and son of Jian Zhen being so rude.

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,960
I insisted on stealing the birthday cake.

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
How could I abandon Brother Sha?

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
But don't worry, Yuan.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
I won't get you into trouble.

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,840
You really have to save Sha Xiu Zhu.

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
I have to.

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Xie Yuanyuan.

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,120
I really admire your courage and righteousness.

74
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,080
But Sha Xiu Zhu has committed a crime.

75
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
He should be punished for breaking the law.

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,920
He was caught for stealing the card.

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,480
If Lord Lu Yan really gets into trouble,

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
we won't have any good life.

79
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,560
We are just like you who work in the martial arts world.

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,280
We are just eating.

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
We can't ruin our own food, right?

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
You are a woman.

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Why do you have to live a more tiring life than a man?

84
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,480
What's wrong with a woman?

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
A woman can't be loyal and loyal like a man

86
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,880
and serve the country.

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,880
Think about it.

88
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,280
If you didn't have your mother, where would you go to steal the birth certificate?

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
If you didn't have your sister Shangguan,

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,280
you could have been free and free in this world

91
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,480
and lived for three years.

92
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,880
If you didn't have me,

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,280
you wouldn't even know who to eat this meal.

94
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,080
You are drunk.

95
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,080
Just kidding.

96
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,480
I've never been drunk since I was a child.

97
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,280
Don't blame me for not telling you.

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,480
This wine is very strong.

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,680
It's just a wine.

100
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Fill it up.

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,080
I'll fill it up.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
You are so stingy.

103
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,480
You are creamy.

104
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,880
Try it.

105
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,280
Try it.

106
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
I was so stubborn when I was a child.

107
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Your Excellency, you are so elegant.

108
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
You even invited me to taste this tea.

109
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Yangzhou is a good place.

110
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
The city of Yan is wet.

111
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
If it were in the capital,

112
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
how could the rain and ice be so elegant?

113
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
I wonder if you invited me here today...

114
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
I think it's better to return the thing to its original owner.

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Young Master's martial arts are good.

116
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
It's just that your temperament is not good.

117
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
I know that you grew up together.

118
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
You studied in the same place.

119
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
You have a deep relationship.

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
I can understand that.

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
But...

122
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Shang Chuan took away the birthday cake.

123
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
And he even made a mistake by secretly investigating the body.

124
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Isn't that a bit too much?

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
I think you should be careful.

126
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
What are you talking about?

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
How can I not understand?

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Since you don't understand,

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
I'll talk to Xie Xiao directly.

130
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Wait.

131
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
You're the Hall Leader.

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
You have too much knowledge.

133
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
You're too good at boxing.

134
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Xie Xiao is also a loyal friend.

135
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
He didn't save the Sha Qiu Zhu.

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
And he broke into the tea house to secretly investigate the body.

137
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
You have a junior like him.

138
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
He should be very capable.

139
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
He's a good person.

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
He should be very headache.

141
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Since you still want me to talk to you,

142
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
why don't you just get married?

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
It would be better if I did that earlier.

144
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Why are you so heavy?

145
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Who told you to eat so much?

146
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Eat more!

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Don't pull my hair!

148
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
You're too bad at drinking.

149
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
I won't drink with you anymore.

150
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Heroine Yuan, wake up.

151
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
We're here. Wake up.

152
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Come, slow down.

153
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:28,660
Xie Xiao, just leave the

154
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
Jin Xia to me.

155
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
You can leave now.

156
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I told you to stay a little longer.

157
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
You're too playful.

158
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
You're drunk like this.

159
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,940
You must draw what is the試著 of your forbidden expelled as well.

160
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,220
But beyond the ground is a simple law to prevent others from destroying it.

161
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,220
They just have to do what's written in the material to break the law.

162
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,220
This is where the Nazar Regiment users will be in after turning back the past year.

163
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,820
The hunting men,

164
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
the post- Tell them not to do so.

165
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Wendy,

166
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,820
are you still not willing to break in?

167
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,420
Obedience to a woman is a opposite of weakness for you.

168
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,060
Are you really in the mood to don't break in?

169
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,820
Lord Lu asked me to tell you

170
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,380
to be honest and loyal.

171
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,300
He wants you to take the case to the capital.

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,620
He asked you to bring Sha Xiuzhu to the government office.

173
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,300
Tell Yang Yue to take the case.

174
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,020
What clue do you have to bring Sha Xiuzhu?

175
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,220
You just have to listen to the order of the lord.

176
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,100
Hurry up.

177
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,580
Why are you pushing me?

178
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,620
Why are you listening to my order?

179
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,100
Why didn't I take off my shoes?

180
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,140
I was just...

181
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,980
Hurry up.

182
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,940
Let's go.

183
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,060
Come on.

184
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,740
The imperial guards are so unusual.

185
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,380
If we arrest the criminal,

186
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,100
the people will be suspicious.

187
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,860
We can't take the case without the government officers.

188
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,460
It's a small matter.

189
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,660
Of course.

190
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,340
Who are the imperial guards?

191
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,940
How dare the people get into trouble?

192
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,460
When I remember,

193
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,580
my master's hometown is also the imperial guards.

194
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,900
It must be very windy

195
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,620
when he went out to handle the case.

196
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,660
Now he is just a

197
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,940
servant of the six gates.

198
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,780
This treatment

199
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,340
really fell from the sky to the ground.

200
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,780
I think it's okay.

201
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,260
Dad is a man of honor and power.

202
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,380
He has no grudge against the world.

203
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,500
It's good for us to be a subordinate.

204
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I think it's good.

205
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,980
I really want to know

206
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,860
how the master's mentality is adjusted.

207
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
He must have experienced a painful struggle

208
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,580
to get rid of the identity of the imperial guards

209
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,140
and be a servant.

210
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,500
I say, Master Xia.

211
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,860
You really have a good wound and forget about it.

212
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,300
Did you forget about the things

213
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,900
that dad punished you to destroy the country?

214
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,140
No, I didn't forget.

215
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,140
No, no.

216
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,780
Are all the criminals in the six gates

217
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,580
so slow and not careful?

218
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,540
Of course not.

219
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,780
Then be careful.

220
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,020
The streets are complicated.

221
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,820
Walk faster.

222
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I know.

223
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,820
The streets are complicated even if one person is not there.

224
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,700
Okay.

225
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,020
If something goes wrong,

226
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,980
we have to take responsibility.

227
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Let's go.

228
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,300
Hurry!

229
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Hurry up.

230
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Come on.

231
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,460
You!

232
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
What's up?

233
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
Go ahead!

234
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Hurry up Finn!

235
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,160
Kill him...

236
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,280
fearlessly

237
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Jin Xia!

238
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Jin Xia! Go after her!

239
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Okay!

240
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Dai Yang! You go first!

241
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Hurry!

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Stop!

243
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
If you want to leave, it depends on whether you have the life to take them away today!

244
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Yuan Da Xia, it's me.

245
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Xie Xiao? You...

246
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Let us go.

247
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Impossible!

248
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
She won't hurt us.

249
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
You two take Brother Sha away.

250
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Brother, I can't drag you down.

251
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
We have to go together!

252
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Brother Sha, I'm fine.

253
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Take Brother Sha away!

254
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
I won't go!

255
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Hurry!

256
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
If you dare to go, I'll kill you!

257
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Brother Sha is closer than my own brother.

258
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
I can't help but save him!

259
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Brother Sha has been taking care of me for the past three years.

260
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
We have been husband and wife.

261
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
We have never done anything wrong.

262
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm glad to hear that.

263
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Jin Xia, do you remember what I said last night?

264
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
You have to kill the Young Master.

265
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I have to.

266
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Xie Xiao Yuan, I really admire your heroism.

267
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Jin Xia, for the sake of our childhood,

268
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
let us go.

269
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
What are you doing?

270
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm a official, you're a thief.

271
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
No matter how good our relationship is,

272
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I can't leave without permission.

273
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Okay.

274
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
If you insist on not letting go,

275
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
then kill me.

276
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Brother!

277
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Take Brother Sha away!

278
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Hurry!

279
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Xiao Yuan, go back with you!

280
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Let me go!

281
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Let me go!

282
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Brother Sha, let's go!

283
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Let's go!

284
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Let's go!

285
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
If you're worried that you can't hand over the task,

286
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
then do it.

287
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,740
But one more thing

288
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Your protection is our health

289
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,460
Ult Hu Qi

290
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,180
Kill the jurisdiction

291
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,100
ult Hu Qi

292
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,340
The summary of the situation

293
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:35,980
Di Renjie

294
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,060
� Xin אנ

295
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,580
This Yan Made Lian

296
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
I...

297
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
This...

298
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
It's really...

299
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Miss Shangguan, you know me.

300
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,580
I always follow the law.

301
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,580
This matter is very important.

302
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
That's why I said I would take you down.

303
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
I actually didn't...

304
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Anyway, I'm sorry.

305
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
It's very important?

306
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
I'll go ask your lordship.

307
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,580
Why is it so important to send you two to escort me to the palace?

308
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm afraid that you'll be too tired.

309
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,580
I'm afraid that you'll be too tired.

310
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
It's very important.

311
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Why did I only send you two to escort Sha Xiuzhu?

312
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
It's very important.

313
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,580
How did we know?

314
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,580
How did we ambush her?

315
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,580
Do I have the ability to tell the world

316
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,580
when your lordship will interrogate the criminals?

317
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
This...

318
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,580
You have a good skin.

319
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,580
It's a pity that you're a dumb head.

320
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Miss Shangguan, no matter what you say today,

321
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,580
I'm afraid that I still have to take you back to the palace.

322
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I'm telling the truth.

323
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
You can ask me when you get back.

324
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Yang Pukui wants to arrest me.

325
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,580
I'm afraid that he'll need to practice this martial art for a few more years.

326
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Stop right there!

327
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,580
The prisoner has been kidnapped.

328
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,580
I think that Yang Pukui should go back and report to your lordship.

329
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
I'll go with you.

330
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,580
How about you take me back?

331
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,580
I'll bear the punishment of killing my brother.

332
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Just chop my arm.

333
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Don't hurt my meridians.

334
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
If I do it myself,

335
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
I'll be dead.

336
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
Hurry up!

337
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
You just had a death wish.

338
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Why are you so careless now?

339
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
Don't let me lose my job and ruin the dinner.

340
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
If you ruin the dinner, then you should do it.

341
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,580
What's so great about it?

342
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
Stop talking nonsense. Look!

343
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
Fatty!

344
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Yang Pukui!

345
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Fatty!

346
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
You're fatter than a pig!

347
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
I'm not a pig!

348
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
I'm a tiger!

349
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Run!

350
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Who's hitting me?

351
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Run!

352
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
Run!

353
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,580
Are you okay?

354
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Get up.

355
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,580
This...

356
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
My mother didn't allow me to eat.

357
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
So I used this instead.

358
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Thank you.

359
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,580
For what?

360
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,580
Master wants me to take care of you.

361
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,580
You can follow me.

362
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
Let's go.

363
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Why are you standing there?

364
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Let's go.

365
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,580
I'll take you to fight with bad guys.

366
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
Let's go.

367
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
You ruined my job.

368
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,580
I'll raise you at the worst.

369
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
You're not a pig.

370
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
You're worse than me.

371
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Liu Daxiang!

372
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
You really dare to do that?

373
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Why are you so stupid?

374
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
Stop talking.

375
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
Go.

376
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
If you don't do this, how can I go?

377
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,580
You don't want me to change my mind?

378
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Okay.

379
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
I'll pay you back.

380
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,580
I won't forget you.

381
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Stop talking nonsense.

382
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,580
Even if you forget, I won't.

383
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Go.

384
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Go.

385
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Go.

386
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
This heartless girl.

387
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
She ran so fast.

388
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
She didn't even look back.

389
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
Sir.

390
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
We escorted the criminal to the crime scene.

391
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
We caught him while he was on the way.

392
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Sha Xiaozhu was kidnapped by a group of thieves.

393
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
Cen Xiaowei is unconscious.

394
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
It's me.

395
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
It was me,ный

396
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Who are you?

397
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,580
I'm a developer or an actor?

398
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Everyone's in an orphanage.

399
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
How could you give上 ?

400
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,400
arel

401
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,160
so long as you chase after your emotionally

402
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,580
rin inflammation

403
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,420
There will be celebration in the palace.

404
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,620
If lost, I am suspected.

405
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,620
Do you see it.

406
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,620
What bye bye

407
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,380
It will be better as you said

408
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Yes.

409
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
Don't tell me that I gave it to her.

410
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Understood.

411
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
Is Yuan Bu Kui here?

412
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,620
Please come in.

413
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Commandant Chen, are you alright?

414
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
I'm fine.

415
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,620
I heard that Yuan Bu Kui is injured.

416
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,620
This is a golden medicine that the Imperial Medicine Department has provided to the North Town.

417
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,620
It's better than the ones outside.

418
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,620
It can cure the wound.

419
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,620
I'm not worthy of being called a thief.

420
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
Thank you for saving me.

421
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,620
I hope you don't mind.

422
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,620
I'm always a person who loves to give.

423
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,620
When someone treats me well, I treat him well.

424
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,620
If someone bullies me, I will return it.

425
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,620
As long as Commandant Chen doesn't say that the people in the Sixth Gate are useless,

426
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
I will forget about the past.

427
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
Thank you for your medicine.

428
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
I won't take it.

429
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Alright, I'll go back first.

430
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Thank you.

431
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,620
You think that I will believe you if you say something nice?

432
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,620
Who knows what kind of medicine you are using?

433
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,620
I'm fine.

434
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,620
Xia Er.

435
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,620
Xia Er, you are so good at jumping.

436
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
Come here.

437
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,620
Grandpa.

438
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,620
What is this?

439
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
A stone.

440
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,620
I picked it up from over there.

441
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
You picked it up from over there?

442
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,620
You don't pick this up?

443
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
Come here.

444
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
I'll tell you.

445
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I'll give you something more fun.

446
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,620
Okay.

447
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
Look.

448
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Xia Er, there are so many things.

449
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Grandpa, what is this?

450
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,620
These are all the hand guns that I collected.

451
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,620
This gun was shot out.

452
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,620
Look, which one is better?

453
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,620
Which one do you like?

454
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,620
You like this one?

455
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
This one?

456
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
This one?

457
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,620
That one?

458
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Or this one?

459
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
This one.

460
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
Xia Er is so smart.

461
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,620
She likes good things.

462
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
Aim it.

463
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
Aim it here.

464
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,620
This way.

465
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,620
Good.

466
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,620
Jin Xia, you are awake.

467
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Jin Xia.

468
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
Jin Xia.

469
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Why are you here?

470
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
I came to see you.

471
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,620
You bastard.

472
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Mr. Lu is investigating this case.

473
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,620
If he finds out, I'll be killed by you.

474
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
Hurry up.

475
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,620
Jin Xia, you are so badly injured.

476
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
I'm worried about you.

477
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,620
So I brought the best medicine to see you.

478
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,620
Don't you know that you have a fever?

479
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,620
It must be caused by the wound.

480
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
Let me apply the medicine.

481
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,620
No, no.

482
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,620
Give me the medicine.

483
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,620
I'll do it myself.

484
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,620
Let me do it.

485
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,620
I can do it myself.

486
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,620
Let me do it.

487
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,620
You...

488
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
Officer Yuan.

489
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
Mr. Lu.

490
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,620
Open the door.

491
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
Wait a minute.

492
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,620
I need to change my clothes.

493
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
Get up.

494
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,620
What should we do?

495
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,620
Get up.

496
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
Where should we hide?

497
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
Go.

498
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
Wait a minute.

499
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,620
I'll be right back.

500
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Wait a minute.

501
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
Officer.

502
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Why don't you use the medicine that I gave you?

503
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
I have the medicine.

504
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
Look at you.

505
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,620
If you use the medicine, it won't be this serious.

506
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,620
What?

507
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Are you afraid that I'll hurt you?

508
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,620
No, no, no.

509
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,620
Of course not.

510
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,620
I just...

511
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,620
I...

512
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,620
I'll tell you the truth.

513
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,620
That medicine is too precious.

514
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,620
If I really use this medicine,

515
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,620
what if the officer comes to me for money?

516
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,620
I won't be able to pay back.

517
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,620
For you,

518
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,620
is life important or is money important?

519
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,620
Both are important.

520
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,620
I mean,

521
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
let me give you an example.

522
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
A bowl of vermicelli and a bowl of fish.

523
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
That's all for a full stomach.

524
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
Then I'll definitely choose vermicelli.

525
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
I'm not going to use vermicelli.

526
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Because it won't cost too much.

527
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
If you want to be better,

528
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
then use the medicine.

529
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
Since there's a thief in the room,

530
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
when you rest,

531
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,620
remember to close the door and window.

532
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,620
Who are you calling a thief?

533
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Enough.

534
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Sir Lu has already noticed.

535
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,620
Hurry and leave.

536
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
What about your injury?

537
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
I have medicine.

538
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,620
It's fine.

539
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Use my bottle.

540
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,620
Okay, let's go.

541
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
Take care of your injury.

542
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Hurry up.

543
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
This guy is a thief.

544
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,620
He keeps coming at me.

545
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
Is this the second time he's here

546
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
or is it personally?

547
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
It shouldn't be a small poison, right?

548
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
It's okay.

549
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
It doesn't hurt so quickly.

550
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Look at you now.

551
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,620
If you use the medicine I gave you,

552
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
it won't be this serious.

553
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
So it was the medicine

554
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
that you asked Tan Xiao Wei to give you.

555
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
Sir,

556
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,620
the thing you wanted.

557
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Master Shang Guan is really a good man.

558
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Isn't that the two boxes of Holy Beads?

559
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,620
How...

560
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
Go back and ask your master.

561
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
This is a serious matter.

562
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Why did he only send you

563
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,620
to escort the Holy Beads?

564
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,620
How did we know

565
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,620
and how did we ambush them?

566
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
You're willing to let the Holy Beads go.

567
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
Aren't you afraid that I won't

568
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
give you the Holy Beads after I die?

569
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm afraid that you won't be able to

570
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
give me the Holy Beads after I die.

571
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,620
If that's the case,

572
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
Master Shang Guan should be worried now.

573
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,620
When will I

574
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,620
be able to take over the Wu An Gang?

575
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
As the saying goes,

576
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
the people don't fight with the officials.

577
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,620
It's true.

578
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,620
Move in.

579
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,620
Yes.

580
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
It seems that Miss Shang Guan

581
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,620
has something to say.

582
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
She didn't lie to me.

583
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,620
I...

584
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
What did you say?

585
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
The Slaughter Master was taken away by Xie Xiao

586
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
was a deal between Lu Yi and Shang Guan Xi.

587
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Why didn't he tell us?

588
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,620
He even made Master Xiao

589
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620
suffer a lot.

590
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
I was wondering why

591
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,620
this Lord Lu Yan was so kind

592
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,620
and even put me in the trap.

593
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
It turns out that he was guilty

594
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,620
and couldn't get over it.

595
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,620
I think

596
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,620
when we see Lord Lu in the future,

597
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
we should go around

598
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,620
the same way

599
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
you said.

600
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
Right.

601
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,620
Does it still hurt?

602
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,620
Yes.

603
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
I'll follow your order

604
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
to investigate the crimes of

605
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
General Feng Guo and Slaughter Master.

606
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,620
After investigating for several days

607
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
after following me in Yangzhou,

608
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,620
I've found out what the crimes of Slaughter Master are.

609
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
One,

610
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Slaughter Master

611
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
abused Qin Shou Xing.

612
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,620
I often take people's children as my slave.

613
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,880
then he will know that it's you and bury him.

614
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,900
This is to앜 college's ancestor

615
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,040
would also be found as his father's wife ,

616
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,220
then he will kill him.

617
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,680
2

618
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,160
If your cigars are stolen, that is your private possession

619
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,820
3

620
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,620
If the variables change before you basis

621
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,200
The gap between you and outsiders is bigger

622
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,800
And you may sell the selling of things

623
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,280
That is in records

624
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,340
4

625
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,340
Just die without facing them

626
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,880
Or

627
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
There is no clue about Cao Kun.

628
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,000
He needs to return to the capital as soon as possible.

629
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,960
Hope you can allow him.

630
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,280
Li Fang.

631
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

632
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Give the order.

633
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,080
Ask Jian Zhen and his son

634
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,080
to meet the Three Judicial Offices.

635
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,440
Yes.

636
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,920
Lu Jingli has made another contribution.

637
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,560
Take the order.

638
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

639
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,000
Lord Zhou.

640
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,520
Lord Zhou.

641
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,440
Are you safe?

642
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,800
Chief and Young Master.

643
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,560
Although the money

644
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,200
is for your Wu'an Gang,

645
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,720
no one should dare to mess it up.

646
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
But it's 100,000 yuan after all.

647
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,960
I was so worried along the way.

648
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,880
But now

649
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,120
we're back in Yangzhou.

650
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,280
I finally can put down

651
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,440
a stone in my heart.

652
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
The task is not completed yet.

653
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
We need to send these money

654
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,560
to the bank of the government

655
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
to be safe.

656
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,800
Yes, yes.

657
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
Thank you, Chief.

658
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,160
Please.

659
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,040
Please.

660
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,840
Yes.

661
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,160
Is the number correct?

662
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,080
Yes, sir.

663
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,920
Yes.

664
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,640
We've finished the cleaning.

665
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,800
It's not long at all.

666
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,280
I feel much more at ease.

667
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,280
Thank you, guys.

668
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,080
Thank you.

669
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,680
It's my duty, Lord Zhou.

670
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,880
We'll leave now.

671
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,160
Goodbye.

672
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,120
Let's go home for dinner.

673
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,320
By the will of Heaven,

674
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,640
the Emperor has decreed

675
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,400
that the Imperial Guards should be loyal and honest

676
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,800
and show their gratitude to the people.

677
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,320
The first thing to do is to be sincere.

678
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,720
General Fengguo

679
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,160
has done a good job

680
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,280
in the investigation of the case of the father and son of Jianzhen.

681
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,600
He has been rewarded with 10,000 taels.

682
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,040
The Six Sages Sect has done a good job in the investigation.

683
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,440
He has been rewarded with 100 taels.

684
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,000
That's all.

685
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,760
The Six Sages Sect has made such a great effort

686
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,080
to reward him with such a small amount of money.

687
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,400
But that Lord Lu Yan

688
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
has only been rewarded with 10,000 taels.

689
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,040
Is it fair?

690
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,640
Our official rank is lower than his.

691
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,000
Of course, we'll be rewarded with less money.

692
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,120
Don't be so arrogant.

693
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,680
We'll be rewarded with more money than him.

694
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,680
Xia'er.

695
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,520
You forgot my order again.

696
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,680
I didn't forget.

697
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,160
I'll do more.

698
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,960
General Fengguo's case is over.

699
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,800
You two

700
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,800
pack up your things later.

701
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,800
We should go back to the capital.

702
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,480
Officer Yang.

703
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,680
Lord Lu.

704
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,040
Don't rush to go back.

705
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,720
Since we're in Yangzhou,

706
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,160
we might as well stay a few more days.

707
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,120
Well...

708
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,000
Yes, Master.

709
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,520
We've come to Yangzhou from far away.

710
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,040
Of course, we have to experience

711
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,280
the old and rare Huanghe Road

712
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,120
and the West Lake.

713
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,720
The fireworks will be in Yangzhou for three months.

714
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,320
The view will be the best.

715
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,480
The view of the Yangtze River

716
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,800
will be the best.

717
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,360
Right?

718
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,680
Good idea.

719
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,040
Good idea.

720
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,160
Officer Yang.

721
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,160
There's a famous doctor in Yangzhou

722
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,920
who is a doctor of the whole valley.

723
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
His name is Shen Mingmi.

724
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,160
I'll send someone to inform him.

725
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
He'll take you to see him.

726
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,920
Lord Lu.

727
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,040
This Shen Mingmi

728
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,880
has been a doctor for generations.

729
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,080
He's experienced in

730
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,680
treating wounds and bone fractures.

731
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
I think you should stop

732
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,560
your injuries.

733
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,880
How can I bother you with my business?

734
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800
You helped me investigate a case.

735
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,560
I'm grateful to you.

736
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,080
Father.

737
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,720
I think we should go.

738
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,600
Although it might not be cured,

739
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
there will be some ways to support him.

740
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,960
Yes, Master.

741
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
Don't let him down.

742
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,920
Officer Yang.

743
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,600
It's settled.

744
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,760
Thank you, sir.

745
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,000
You're welcome.

746
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,800
Childe.

747
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,880
Did Zhou Xianyi take 100,000 taels of divorce money

748
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,360
and send them back to Yangzhou?

749
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,200
I've heard about it.

750
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,760
Zhou Xianyi …

751
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,920
He's just a doctor of

752
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,160
the City Council.

753
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,920
He pretends to be upright and doesn't seem ill.

754
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,600
And gets divorce money

755
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,280
just to act like a treasure.

756
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,680
Instead of sending them back,

757
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,240
he even called a gang

758
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,360
who can harm our villagers.

759
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,720
Don't come.

760
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
He's clearly trying to give us a chance to get out of this.

761
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,720
You're a minister of the Ministry of Works.

762
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
You're really a coward.

763
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,720
You're being controlled by a servant of Zhou Xian.

764
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Don't you think it's funny to say that?

765
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
He's just a stubborn person.

766
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
He doesn't listen to orders.

767
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Now he's taking orders from the imperial decree.

768
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
He's following orders to make peace.

769
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,720
I really don't have any way to get him out of this.

770
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Don't worry.

771
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Everything is under my control.

772
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,720
The Emperor's Manor

773
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Doctor, how is my father's leg?

774
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Sir, the bone wound wasn't healed back then.

775
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,720
If you want to treat it, you have to cut it off again.

776
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
This...

777
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
You're old now.

778
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,720
After you get it done, you can't move your body for at least three months.

779
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
To make sure that there's not enough blood,

780
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
you need to clean the blood vessel.

781
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Can you do that?

782
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,720
It's already very painful to cut off the bone and get it back.

783
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,720
I still have to move my body for three months?

784
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Doctor, we're going to go out of the palace to do our duty.

785
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
How can we do that?

786
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Thank you, Doctor. You're right.

787
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,720
I'm old now, and I don't want to be punished for my misdeed.

788
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Sir Lu, I think it's better...

789
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Three months is not a problem.

790
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Officer Yang, the Chief of the Six Hills Gate is a good friend of mine.

791
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I can say hello to him and give you a half-year leave.

792
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Then you won't have any worries.

793
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
No, no, absolutely not.

794
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Officer Yang, you should just be at ease.

795
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,720
To be honest, my father especially told me about this.

796
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Don't make me feel bad.

797
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Then, thank you, Sir.

798
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
You're welcome.

799
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Thank you for helping my Master.

800
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,720
From now on, you can thank me if you're more at ease.

801
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Yes.

802
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,720
simple.

803
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
Mr. Zhou, thanks, you're working hard.

804
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm leaving.

805
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,720
Zhou Xianyi, how dare you!

806
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,120
You've taken away the 100,000 taels of money

807
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,520
in just a few days.

808
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,520
I didn't.

809
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
How dare you!

810
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,320
You've been keeping the key to the silver box.

811
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,720
Now the official's home is still here.

812
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,520
But the money is gone.

813
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,920
It's obvious that you're the one who did it.

814
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,120
Guards!

815
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,120
Yes.

816
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,720
Take Zhou Xianyi away.

817
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,720
Yes.

818
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,720
It's not me, my lord.

819
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,120
My lord, it's not me.

820
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,520
I'm innocent.

821
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,520
My lord.

822
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,120
My lord.

823
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,320
The Yangzhou river is in decline.

824
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,920
Zhou Xianyi, the doctor of the Dushui Green Wings,

825
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,320
has taken away the 100,000 taels of money.

826
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,120
I'll hand this case to Lu Jingli

827
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,120
to investigate it and get it back as soon as possible.

828
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,320
Zhou Xianyi?

829
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,520
Zhou Xianyi took away the money.

830
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,320
His majesty ordered me to investigate this case.

831
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,120
I think the tracking of Yang Botou is important.

832
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,920
I wonder if Yang Botou is willing to handle it.

833
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm afraid that

834
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,720
the truth is out of the question.

835
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,720
You're right.

836
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,120
The Yangzhou River is in decline.

837
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,920
I don't know if Yang Botou is willing to handle it.

838
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,320
Thank you for your appreciation.

839
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,520
But I'm in a bad situation.

840
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,120
Father, the 100,000 taels of money is a big deal.

841
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,720
You can rest if you don't feel well.

842
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,320
I'll take care of Jinxia and myself.

843
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,520
Ceng Fu,

844
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
go to the report of the Nizhang,

845
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
and transfer Yang Botou to the Beisheng Prefecture Office.

846
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:11,920
Yes.

847
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,520
Wait.

848
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
The investigation is the investigation.

849
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,320
Why would you transfer our master to the Beisheng Prefecture Office?

850
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,720
Yang Botou's leg injury

851
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
can be removed.

852
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,320
First, he can recover.

853
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,320
Second,

854
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
he doesn't need to worry about the six gates anymore.

855
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,920
Thank you for your consideration.

856
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,720
What?

857
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,920
Does Yuan Bukuan have other ideas?

858
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,520
Sir,

859
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,120
is there any supplementary for the investigation?

860
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,920
Yes.

861
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,520
I'll give you two taels of silver.

862
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,720
I'll give you the money.

863
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,120
As a civil servant,

864
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,920
I must focus on state affairs.

865
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,120
If you need anything,

866
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
just tell me.

867
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,320
I'll do whatever you say.

868
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,920
Sir,

869
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,720
what tea?

870
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,520
Guanlou.

871
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,920
Sir,

872
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,520
without the order of the magistrate,

873
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,120
no one is allowed to interrogate the criminal.

874
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,320
This is the imperial edict sent by His Majesty.

875
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
From today onwards,

876
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,920
the Imperial Guards will take over this case.

877
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,720
I'm just afraid that I'll add more ingredients to your bowl.

878
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,520
Sir, please enjoy.

879
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,320
Yuan Bukuan,

880
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
you have to be a maid

881
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,120
to be a maid.

882
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,720
You're so reckless.

883
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,720
You'll be caught easily.

884
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,120
Let me treat you a little better.

885
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,720
Yuan Bukuan,

886
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,320
last time you withandered,

887
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,720
I przy ş 경ne aleksand shouted

888
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,920
Your family is all ruined.

889
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,120
I'm waiting to see you die.

890
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,720
Youguung is тwong on the road

891
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,120
Over check theYougueng.

892
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,120
Quick.

893
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,320
Yougueng!

894
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,720
Have you slit your teeth?

895
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,920
I will see you again in my dream.
