You're so stupid.

144
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,320
If you hadn't taken my bracelet,

145

I would have caught Cao Kun long ago.

Please let go of me!

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Slow down.

178
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Slow down.

179
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
We agreed to meet outside the city.

180
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
You...

181
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Your action and strength are still not standard enough.

182
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
If Master sees you, he will definitely correct you.

183
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Okay.

184
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
I'll set a standard for you.

185
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Stop!

186
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Stop!

187
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Okay, okay, I'm done.

188
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
You've had enough.

189
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Give me another round.

190
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,960
You see, since you came back from outside the city,

191
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I've been the one who's been angry.

192
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
If you keep going on like this,

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
I won't be able to take it anymore.

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
I can't take it anymore.

195
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
That's because you weren't there.

196
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
If you were there, you would be the same as me.

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
But you offended the police.

198
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm afraid you won't be able to live well in the future.

199
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I didn't think about the future.

200
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I just thought that if this case can't be solved,

201
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
it will not only disgrace our Six Sages,

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
but also my hand.

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,960
It's a pity that I didn't see the famous

204
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,960
violent and cruel police Lu Yi.

205
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
You're lucky.

206
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger if you see him.

207
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
That's just a model for me to learn.

208
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Master Xia, you must be tired.

209
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Come, come, come. Have some tea.

210
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Rest, rest.

211
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Father.

212
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,960
I heard that you got into trouble when you met him.

213
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Stop.

214
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
What?

215
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Shouldn't you explain to me?

216
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
I'm not good at playing the flute.

217
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
I should practice it.

218
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
I've told you many times.

219
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
You're not patient in making big plans.

220
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,960
You're just too casual in your daily life.

221
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
You'll be a loser if you keep doing this.

222
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I have my own rules.

223
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Don't bother.

224
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
You haven't forgotten.

225
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
How long are you going to remember?

226
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Are you going to remember it for a lifetime?

227
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I've been a police officer for these years.

228
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
The most common thing I hear

229
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
is that a father must have a son.

230
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
What a good father must have a son.

231
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Father is a good man.

232
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Do you expect me to be loyal to him?

233
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Lu Yi.

234
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Am I wrong?

235
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Father, you're hurt because of this slap.

236
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Not me.

237
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
But,

238
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,960
you're a good man.

239
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,960
But you've never done any loss-making business.

240
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
You're good at both the body and the body.

241
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm not convinced if you're the second.

242
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I know you'll have a good plan

243
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
if you dare to talk.

244
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
You're my best buddy.

245
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,960
I know the principle of being a man is

246
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
one, a good man doesn't lose in front of others.

247
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Two, a good man can lose in front of others.

248
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Three, a good man can lose in front of others.

249
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Yes.

250
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
A good man does what he's supposed to do.

251
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I dare to say that

252
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
because I'm not used to seeing the police

253
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
attacking us.

254
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,960
And I found an important clue

255
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
that has something to do with Cao Kun.

256
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
What clue?

257
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
We still don't know the truth.

258
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
We'll check it tomorrow.

259
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
I'm right.

260
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Cao Kun should be still in the capital.

261
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,320
should be still in the capital

262
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:34,940
Nextobi

263
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,480
You can only consider martial arts skills

264
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,280
our top six ghosts can't beat my arrange

265
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,120
But

266
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,340
if these loyalists could be caught

267
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,040
What is going on?

268
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:29,240
Great

269
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,660
computing power of the

270
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:45,700
talking

271
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:55,240
mother

272
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,720
Make us eat

273
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,680
Gengyin

274
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,640
Why are you being so exquisite?

275
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
You know where josu kimura is

276
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
Where have you been?

277
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,640
Who are you, I am remshirted

278
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
Chen Wukong

279
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
You know he��

280
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,760
What do you do to this emperor's brother?

281
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,640
I must report to the envoy

282
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,400
No

283
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,760
then you will go back for your engagement from Nowhere.

284
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,640
Stop.

285
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,880
How is Lord Xu's reaction on this?

286
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,920
He's not doing anything.

287
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,040
Since the accident of the Cao family,

288
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
Minister has been showingerald health.

289
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,200
He has been sick for days.

290
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,000
No.

291
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,760
Money.

292
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
Money.

293
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
Money.

294
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,980
Happy一

295
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,040
This is brilliant.

296
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,100
It's so brilliant.

297
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,160
Thank you.

298
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:27,900
Congratulations.

299
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:28,760
Yes.

300
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,720
Congratulations.

301
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,940
Congratulations Yuyuan.

302
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,120
You have some idea?

303
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,480
We have been ignoring

304
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,520
an important clue.

305
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,760
It's Cao Ling'er.

306
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,920
Cao Ling'er?

307
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,760
What does it have to do with the pawnshop?

308
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,880
A new person told me

309
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,200
Cao Ling'er would go to the temple to pray every day.

310
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,680
He would walk from the back door of the temple

311
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,320
to the pawnshop.

312
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,400
I checked the pawnshop.

313
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,120
The owner behind it is Cao Kun.

314
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,240
So

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,120
it was the one who sealed the Cao's property.

316
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
The fish of the net?

317
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,160
Yes.

318
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,720
Cao Kun used the pawnshop

319
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,120
with someone he couldn't get along with

320
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,960
to sell high-priced antiques and art pieces

321
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,440
at a fixed time.

322
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
Using complex human relations

323
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
to cover up

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,480
those illegal acts.

325
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,280
Then the real Cao Kun

326
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,880
could be hiding here.

327
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,640
That's it.

328
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,120
Wait.

329
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,520
I'll go call nine brothers.

330
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,520
Don't make a fuss.

331
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,240
We need to catch the fish.

332
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,040
What a bad luck.

333
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,240
Why is it him again?

334
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,520
Good eye.

335
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,880
Lord, please come.

336
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,640
Get out.

337
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,160
During the time of Cheng Hua,

338
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,620
he was killed by Mu Lao and

339
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,960
his name is Lin Lang.

340
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,360
I think all of you here know

341
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,280
that great Taoists of Mu Lao civilization

342
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,120
only alphabetically preaching disciples that

343
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,640
have gone into the ocean.

344
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,400
But

345
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,200
the words of Lin Lang

346
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,320
are indeed made up

347
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,000
The one you auctioned today is the remaining material

348
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,760
made by Master Mu when he made Lin Lang.

349
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,240
So this one costs 500 taels.

350
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,760
500 taels?

351
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,520
The one made by the border is 500 taels.

352
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,360
Which one will be auctioned?

353
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,440
500 taels.

354
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll auction 800 taels.

355
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,440
I'll auction 1,000 taels.

356
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,120
There are so many people.

357
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,720
It seems that there will be a lively situation.

358
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,920
1,200 taels.

359
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,200
Let's find out the situation around.

360
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay.

361
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,560
1,300 taels.

362
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,520
1,500 taels.

363
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,280
1,500 taels.

364
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,800
1,800 taels.

365
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,000
2,000 taels.

366
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,120
Look.

367
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,000
2,000 taels.

368
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,200
I didn't expect that

369
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,760
I could bid this much.

370
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,720
2,000 taels.

371
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,240
2,000 taels.

372
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,720
2 times.

373
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,880
It seems that there is no limit.

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
There are not many pieces of meat.

375
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,000
2,000 taels is not enough.

376
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,280
500 taels.

377
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,360
500 taels.

378
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,960
Gold.

379
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,880
Gold.

380
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,440
500 taels of gold.

381
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,400
My heart.

382
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,200
How many times can I buy tofu

383
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,640
to get 500 taels?

384
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,200
What a loser.

385
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,320
This guest.

386
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,560
500 taels of gold.

387
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
500 taels once.

388
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,760
500 taels.

389
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,120
Twice.

390
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,680
500 taels.

391
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,120
Three times.

392
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,840
Deal.

393
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,400
200 taels.

394
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,640
Xia Ying, be bold.

395
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,680
Wait a minute.

396
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,480
Let's watch the play first.

397
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,000
This time, Lu Yi has a hard time.

398
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,560
I didn't know you were here.

399
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,760
Sir.

401
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,400
Who is this person?

402
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
He looks like He Shan.

403
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,080
But he looks like

404
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,360
the most arrogant person.

405
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Did you see his right eye?

406
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,000
His right eye is not moving at all.

407
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
His soul is not in his eyes.

408
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
He is obviously a person with a right eye.

409
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
Judging from the posture,

410
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
if I'm not wrong,

411
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,800
he is the so-called Young Master.

412
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,400
Yan Song's son.

413
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,840
Yan Shi Fan.

414
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,320
Good.

415
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,600
Yan Shi Fan?

416
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,600
But I heard that Yan Shi Fan

417
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,520
is a fat,

418
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,480
fair-skinned,

419
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,040
short-sleeved,

420
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,280
and greasy fat man.

421
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,160
He looks like

422
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,280
a charming uncle.

423
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,880
If he is really Yan Shi Fan,

424
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,240
the rumor can't be trusted.

425
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,720
I'll give you 200 taels of silver

426
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,360
to beat this empty monkey.

427
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,800
This...

428
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,480
Manager Lu?

429
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,040
What?

430
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,120
You are here too?

431
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,960
Sir Yan.

432
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,880
What?

433
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,400
Manager Lu

434
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
is also interested in

435
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,920
this empty monkey

436
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
that I just took a picture of?

437
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,840
Say something.

438
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,080
If you like it,

439
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,680
I'll give it to you.

440
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,920
I appreciate

441
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
your kindness.

442
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,680
But a gentleman

443
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
never takes what he likes.

444
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm not a gentleman.

445
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
I'm just a gentleman.

446
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
I'm just a gentleman.

447
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
I'm just a gentleman.

448
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm just a gentleman.

449
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,800
I heard that Sir Yan

450
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,680
has a hobby of collecting

451
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
old toys.

452
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
It's hard to know the cause.

453
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,920
I believe that Sir Yan

454
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,360
will definitely not let him

455
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
be blinded by the truth.

456
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,880
If so,

457
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,760
I won't disturb you anymore.

458
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,840
If you want to listen to the music

459
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,040
after you have experienced it,

460
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
or you want to play the hammer,

461
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm always welcome.

462
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,200
I'm always welcome.

463
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
One мо Herzlal comparison.

464
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,520
Two моabdin giving disputed旧

465
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,280
and threemo Hanshigman看 GN

466
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,960
two мо二,

467
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,440
threemod floating fish including

468
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,280
three producer delegating.

469
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,920
I like this style.

470
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,560
It's just a business.

471
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,520
If I could have such a father,

472
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,960
I would be more jealous than him.

473
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,320
Lord Yan.

474
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,600
I will send someone to send Duke Kong to your mansion.

475
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,800
See you, Lord Yan.

476
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,000
See you, Lord Yan.

477
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,520
See you, Lord Yan.

478
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,360
Lord Yan.

479
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,040
May I ask if you could come here?

480
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,280
It's a rare opportunity.

481
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,880
There are many good things here.

482
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,160
Please come in.

483
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
Please come in.

484
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,160
Please come in, Lord Yan.

485
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm so scared.

486
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,400
If he knows that I saw his face,

487
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,640
he will kill me, right?

488
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,640
I think

489
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,680
Lord Lu is much better than Yan Shi Fang.

490
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,600
Go away.

491
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,200
I just went around.

492
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
This pawnshop is not big.

493
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,680
There is a place

494
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
besides this small building.

495
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,500
There is no unnecessary

496
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,040
But the firewood here is not simple.

497
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
You can sell 500 jin of broken gold.

498
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,920
Since we can't be so bold now,

499
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,280
let's be careful.

500
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,400
Go.

501
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,860
I can give you a cup of

502
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,720
imported Madia wine

503
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,740
and two

504
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,580
rich wine.

505
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,220
In cigarrette wine,

506
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,320
you used a good homage to join the song.

507
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,320
In escrute d'andro opps,

508
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,740
people like 是象徳veda

509
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,220
designed 16 Riversipedy.

510
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
I can't just let you die

511
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
I have to be implicated too

512
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Master

513
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
You can't just abandon me

514
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,220
Think of a way to save me

515
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Please, master

516
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,220
Lord Xu, don't worry

517
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,220
I heard about your business

518
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Master, you have many ways

519
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,220
You must find a way to help me

520
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
How about this

521
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Let me think about it

522
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
You go back first

523
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I will inform you when I have an idea

524
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
Thank you, lord

525
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220
Thank you, lord

526
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,220
I will go back and wait for your news

527
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
Go

528
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,220
You have an idea to stop Xu Lang

529
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,220
We finally have the opportunity

530
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
to use this obedient Xu Lang

531
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
to replace Yang Mo

532
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,220
Since he lost the map

533
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
he can't be saved

534
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,220
and the military power can't be taken by others

535
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
I suggest that we take this opportunity

536
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,220
to find someone to take the initiative

537
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
Who?

538
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Huang Yu

539
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,220
He has done a great service to me

540
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,220
His Majesty has been so generous

541
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,220
It's reasonable to ask him to come

542
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,220
Okay, I will tell His Majesty

543
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Go

544
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
Lord Lu

545
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Lord Lu, what a coincidence

546
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
He is so evil

547
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
What should we do

548
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,220
What if someone finds out

549
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,220
What should we do

550
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,220
What should we do

551
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,220
What should we do

552
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220
What should we do

553
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
What should we do

554
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
What should we do

555
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,220
What should we do

556
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
It's okay to have less weapons

557
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,220
But if someone looks down on us

558
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
I will be embarrassed

559
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
Don't

560
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Let's go

561
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Ghost!

562
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
What's wrong?

563
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
Ghost!

564
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Ghost!

565
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Why are you hugging me?

566
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,220
I think you're scarier than a ghost.

567
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
Sorry.

568
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
Over there.

569
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
I'm sorry.

570
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
I'm sorry.

571
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
I'm sorry.

572
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
I'm sorry.

573
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
I'm sorry.

574
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
I have eyes.

575
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,220
Sir!

576
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
How dare you!

577
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
I've reported to the government.

578
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
Stop talking nonsense!

579
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Lu...

580
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
Sir.

581
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
I didn't know it was you.

582
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
I'm sorry.

583
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
I misunderstood.

584
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
I misunderstood.

585
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,220
This mechanism

586
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
is for protecting the thief.

587
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
You know

588
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
that we have a lot of important items.

589
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
If you need anything,

590
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
just tell me.

591
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,220
I saw that eye just now.

592
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
It's my eye.

593
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
I heard something in the room.

594
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
I thought it was a thief.

595
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
So I released the secret weapon.

596
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,220
Please forgive me.

597
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,220
You old man.

598
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
I just saw that eye.

599
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
It's full of strength.

600
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
A martial artist can't have it.

601
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
It can't be you.

602
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Tell me.

603
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
What's going on?

604
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
Please forgive me.

605
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,220
I really don't know anything.

606
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
You don't have to say it.

607
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,220
Let's go to Zhao Yu and have a good talk.

608
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,220
I...

609
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
I...

610
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
I said

611
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,220
the eye you saw

612
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,220
was Mr. Cao's.

613
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,220
He has been hiding here these days.

614
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Where is he now?

615
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,220
When I released the secret weapon,

616
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,220
Mr. Cao escaped.

617
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,220
Where did he go?

618
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,220
He got a man-made mask recently.

619
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,220
I can't find him.

620
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,220
Man-made mask?

621
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
How to find it?

622
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
This man gave it to you.

623
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:30,220
It's this man.

624
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,220
No matter what,

625
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
you're stronger than me.

626
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,300
The butler said that Cao Kun got a human-skin mask, right?

627
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,380
Yes.

628
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,140
Human-skin mask?

629
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,780
Dayang, wake up.

630
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,340
Let's go check it out overnight.

631
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,980
Who in the capital can make a human-skin mask?

632
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,300
Yes.

633
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,620
You're so right.

634
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,140
Go.

635
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,460
Hurry.

636
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,060
I'll go check it out.

637
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:16,940
What is that

638
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,140
DNews.

639
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,900
Du Help me to fly to hahaha

640
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,620
Sir.

641
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,260
Someone storms a repairman.

642
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,540
Where?

643
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Come on in.

644
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
Come on in.

645
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
Come on in.

646
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
Come on in.

647
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
Who's coming?

648
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
Look at her.

649
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
Come on in.

650
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
Come on in.

651
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Come on in.

652
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
Come on in.

653
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,540
It seems that she's still one step ahead of us.

654
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Let's go and have a look.

655
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
I...

656
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,540
This is not the place where the girl should go.

657
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
Are you sure you want to go in?

658
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,540
How can I investigate if you don't go in?

659
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,540
Have you never been in?

660
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
I...

661
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
You've never been in?

662
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Are you a man?

663
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
Go away.

664
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
I'm a gentleman.

665
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,540
How can I go to that kind of place?

666
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
You're so ignorant.

667
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I've been in there for several times.

668
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,540
Don't say that.

669
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,540
This is not a normal building in the Xiao Xiang Pavilion.

670
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
It's not comparable.

671
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Look at the girls inside.

672
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,540
They're all talented and have a good reputation.

673
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,540
Especially the head.

674
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Aunt Xia.

675
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,540
I didn't expect you to be a veteran.

676
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
It's a good place to sell news.

677
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
Let's go and have a look.

678
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
I...

679
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Sir, please go upstairs.

680
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
Please.

681
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
Go.

682
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,540
Sir Yan.

683
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
I didn't expect to meet you here.

684
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,540
I'm so sorry.

685
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Manager Lu.

686
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
This is not right.

687
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,540
The rumour has only made the family proud.

688
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,540
And it's always self-claimed.

689
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,540
Lu Jingli is deeply influenced by Lu's command.

690
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,540
I thought Lu Jingli wouldn't be in such a situation.

691
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
Sir Yan.

692
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Although my father has high expectations of me.

693
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,540
I'm more happy about this.

694
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Good.

695
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
The same.

696
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
That's good.

697
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,540
I heard that Miss Red Bean from Xiao Xiang Pavilion is talented.

698
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,540
So I brought the newly acquired Konghou here.

699
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,540
I want to let Miss Red Bean play it.

700
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Manager Lu.

701
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,540
Then follow me.

702
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
You can also help me to verify

703
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,540
whether my 200 taels of silver is worth it.

704
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
I've already asked.

705
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Lu Yi has taken the portrait of the mask.

706
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,540
If you want to get it, you have to find a way to approach Lu Yi.

707
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,540
But he's so high-spirited.

708
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
It's not easy to get close to him.

709
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
Wait for me outside.

710
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Yan Jinxia.

711
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,540
You're so natural and self-centered.

712
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,540
It's said that Lu Jingli has been in love with you for a long time.

713
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,540
He's so good at making you happy.

714
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,540
He's so good at making you happy.

715
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,540
He's so good at making you happy.

716
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
He's so good at making you happy.

717
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,540
It's said that Lu Jingli is a good drinker.

718
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Today, we must have a good drink.

719
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Come on.

720
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Mr. Yan.

721
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
Manager Lu.

722
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,540
How's the investigation of Cao Kun's case?

723
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,540
His Majesty is very concerned about you.

724
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,540
You, the Imperial Guards, have to investigate carefully.

725
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Don't let His Majesty worry about you.

726
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
You're right.

727
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,540
I won't let His Majesty down.

728
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Good.

729
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,540
Come on.

730
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,540
I'll give you a toast.

731
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
Come on.

732
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Miss Red Bean's appearance today

733
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,540
is very special.

734
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
I'm sorry.

735
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
I'm sorry.

736
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
I'm sorry.

737
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm sorry.

738
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
I'm sorry.

739
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm sorry.

740
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
I'm sorry.

741
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
I'm sorry.

742
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
I'm sorry.

743
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
I'm sorry.

744
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
I'm sorry.

745
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,540
I'm sorry.

746
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
I'm sorry.

747
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
I'm sorry.

748
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
I'm sorry.

749
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
I'm sorry.

750
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
I'm sorry.

751
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
I'm sorry.

752
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
I'm sorry.

754
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
I'm sorry.

755
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
I'm sorry.

756
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
I'm sorry.

757
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
I'm sorry.

758
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
I'm sorry.

760
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
I'm sorry.

761
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
I'm sorry.

762
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
I'm sorry.

763
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Mother, what song is this?

764
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,540
This song is called Peach Blossom.

765
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
It's made by your master.

766
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
Do you want to learn it?

767
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
I want to learn it.

768
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,540
Come on.

769
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
I'll teach you.

770
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
Come on.

771
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Come on.

772
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Miss Red Bean is in a bad mood today.

773
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Manager Lu, what do you think of Miss Red Bean's performance today?

774
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,540
I like this song very much.

775
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
Really?

776
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
Okay.

777
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,540
I'll give this to you today.

778
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Miss Red Bean, you are so appreciated by Mr. Lu.

779
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:42,540
You must have a good chat with him later.

780
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
I have something to do.

781
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
I'll go first.

782
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

783
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,540
After listening to the song, I should drink.

784
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Mr. Lu, I'm here.

785
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Why doesn't he like the play?

786
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Does he recognize me?

787
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
Who are you?

788
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
Say something.

789
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Why do you play peach blossom medicine?

790
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
The daughter of the Pavilion of Fragrance.

791
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,540
Red Bean.

792
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
This sound.

793
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
It's you.

794
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,540
Miss, have a look.

795
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
You are so heartless.

796
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,540
I'm working on a case.

797
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Why are you still here?

798
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
How could I?

799
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
I've been waiting for you.

800
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
I made it for you.

801
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
You are so kind.

802
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
How is it?

803
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
It was so amazing just now.

804
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
I almost got caught by that Lu Yang Wan.

805
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,540
I was so jealous.

806
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,540
She dressed up and gave me her wedding dress.

807
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,540
How did you get on the stage?

808
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Miss Red Bean is my old friend.

809
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
It's not easy.

810
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
I'll introduce you to some people later.

811
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Seriously, where is the thing?

812
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
Is this Cao Kun?

813
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
He has such a beautiful face.

814
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,540
I'm a little reluctant to catch him.

815
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,540
What if Mr. Lu finds out?

816
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,540
I didn't expect to hide it from the Imperial Guards.

817
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
Besides,

818
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
we can't get Miss Red Bean involved in this.

819
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Right?

820
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
Let's take the time

821
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
to record this person in the painting as soon as possible.

822
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
When he finds out,

823
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
Miss Yellow Flower will become half-old Xun Yang Lu.

824
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Sir.

825
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,540
I've called the little girl you're looking for.

826
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
Sir.

827
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
What can I do for you?

828
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,540
Hand it over.

829
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Hand what over?

830
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Sir.

831
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
Is there any misunderstanding in the middle?

832
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,540
Yuan Bu Kui stole the important evidence

833
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,540
that Mr. Lu got without asking himself.

834
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
Important evidence?

835
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
I...

836
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,540
Mr. Lu lost the evidence?

837
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,540
What is it?

838
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,540
What did you do

839
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,540
that everyone knows?

840
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
No. I don't know.

841
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
I don't know.

842
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,540
I don't even know what you're talking about.

843
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,540
You said I stole the evidence.

844
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Is there any evidence?

845
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
You...

846
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
You're not suitable for this.

847
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,540
You have to tell me the evidence.

848
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
You didn't even have any evidence

849
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,540
and you came to the Six Gates to question me.

850
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,540
How would I know what happened?

851
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Mr. Lu asked you to make a choice.

852
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
The Imperial Guards are not the government officials.

853
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,540
The people we have a eye on

854
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,540
are only the dead and the criminals.

855
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,540
Which one do you want to choose?

856
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
Why should I choose?

857
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
I didn't do anything.

858
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,540
I've never seen a woman with such a thick skin.

859
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:26,060
I'm a

860
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
Mr. Lu already knows

861
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
that you took the handkerchief.

862
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,540
If you want to,

863
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,540
go and apologize to him.

864
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
Maybe he can let you go.

865
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,540
Master.

866
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,540
We didn't do anything wrong.

867
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,540
Don't be afraid.

868
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,540
I'll go on duty.

869
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,540
Sir, your things.

870
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
You're willing to admit it now?

871
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
I just didn't want to admit it.

872
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,540
I didn't want to let you know

873
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,540
that I'm responsible for what I did.

874
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,540
But you're generous.

875
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,540
You won't be able to

876
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,540
argue with a weak woman like me, right?

877
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,540
Weak woman?

878
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
I think Yuan Bu Kuan is not weak at all.

879
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,540
The next step of

880
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
the Samian of the Pavilion of Fragrance

881
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
can't be done by a weak woman.

882
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,540
Tell me honestly.

883
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,540
Why do you like Tao Yao?

884
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,540
Sir, is this important?

885
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,540
I once saved Mu Lang

886
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,540
when I was working in Huguang.

887
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,540
He said that I was a disciple of the official family.

888
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,540
That's it.

889
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,540
Sir,

890
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
how did you know about Tao Yao?

891
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,540
What does it have to do with you?

892
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
It doesn't matter.

893
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,540
Just ask.

894
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,540
Sir,

895
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,540
you asked the official to tell me

896
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,540
to make a choice.

897
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
I'm still young.

898
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,540
I'm not married yet.

899
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,540
I don't want to make

900
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,540
any of the two choices you mentioned.

901
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Sir,

902
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,540
please consider me a beginner.

903
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,540
I'm just a beginner.

904
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Just let him go.

905
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,540
Cao Kuan.

906
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,540
Hurry up.

907
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
Imperial Guard Jing.

908
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Don't be afraid, my daughter.

909
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,540
I'll protect you.

910
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
Hurry up.

911
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,540
Don't go.

912
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,540
Dad, I won't go.

913
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
Hurry up.

914
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,540
Be careful, my daughter.

915
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
How can that be?

916
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,540
This is a case of the Imperial Guard.

917
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,540
Where can you two go?

918
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
Which Imperial Guard did you send?

919
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,540
Imperial Guard Jing Li, Lu Yi.

920
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,540
It's him again.

921
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,540
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,540
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,540
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,540
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,540
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,540
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,540
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,540
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,540
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,540
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,540
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,540
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,540
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,540
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,540
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,540
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,540
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,540
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,540
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,540
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,540
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,540
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,540
I'm sorry.

947
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,540
I'm sorry.

948
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,540
I'm sorry.

949
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,540
I'm sorry.

950
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,540
I'm sorry.
