00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

Who else can fight in Hangzhou?

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I heard that Qi Weigang's wife Wang

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is different from other women

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She's more cruel than men

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Women?

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How can they be cruel?

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't be afraid

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You mean

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You go to the palace tomorrow morning

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
With 200 men

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
To see the city

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I wonder how is it going with the boss?

Xingqiu, hang in there

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't fall asleep

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You saved my master

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I owe you my life

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Good you know

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm holding on

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't close your eyes

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You won't wake up once you close your eyes

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Of course

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I have to take a breath

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
To pay you back

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
This way.

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,040
I found several language officers

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I didn't find them.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
General Yu, how's your men?

46
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,800
They're still here.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,160
What should we do?

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
If something happens to them,

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,080
how can I explain to Master?

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,520
You're facing Commander Lu.

51
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,800
We're facing His Majesty.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,440
Don't worry.

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,840
Lu Yi and Xie Xiao are blessed people.

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,680
They'll come back safely.

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,880
General, Lord Lu is back!

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,280
General, Lord Lu is back!

57
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,040
Junior!

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,480
Lord, Lord Lu is back!

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm so worried.

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
Help Xie Xiao back to the tent.

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,840
Doctor Lin, check him.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,640
Okay.

63
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,560
Commander Lu, Commander Lu.

64
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,640
I'm relieved that you're back safely.

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,720
It's a disaster.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
You've done a great job.

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
Get the doctor here and treat him.

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:34,800
Yes.

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,920
Send him back to the tent.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,760
General Yu, what a good luck!

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,800
Yes.

72
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Come on.

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
Come on, chase me.

74
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,000
You can't catch me.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't run.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Slow down.

77
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Wait for me.

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,320
Okay, okay.

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,240
Slow down.

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,480
Mom.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,760
Wait for me.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,440
It's been more than ten years.

83
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,520
Why does she suddenly become a dream?

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My lord, the wound is healed.

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,480
Would you like some water?

86
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,640
Where's Xie Xiao?

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,040
He's badly injured.

88
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
He's not in danger.

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,120
If Doctor Lin says he'll be late,

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,760
Xie Xiao won't come back alive.

91
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
That's good.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
Did General kill Mao Haifeng?

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,560
After they broke through the mountain,

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Mao Haifeng had burned the bandits.

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
He escaped.

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
He escaped again.

97
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Ready to go.

98
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,640
Yes.

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
Hurry up.

100
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Hurry up.

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,960
Go.

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,640
Hurry up.

103
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,360
Hurry up.

104
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,400
What happened outside?

105
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,440
General Qi's army is going to chase the bandits.

106
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,960
I heard the bandits were originally from Mao Haifeng.

107
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,760
I don't know why they found out later

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,320
that they were going to Hengzhou.

109
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
General Qi didn't fight back earlier than the bandits.

110
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,880
So that they could kill each other.

111
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,920
Hengzhou?

112
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Jinxia is still in Hengzhou.

113
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,760
Sir, you can't get off the bed.

114
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,320
Sir, you...

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,400
Sir, you can't...

116
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,520
Sir, your clothes.

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,120
Sir.

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,600
Lu Qianshi has rushed to Hengzhou.

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,680
General Qi, go after Lu Qianshi.

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,960
Don't let her get into danger alone.

121
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,200
I'll be back in a while.

122
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,800
Yes, sir.

123
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,400
Xiangzi.

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,960
Yes.

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,360
Are you ready for 500 elite soldiers?

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,200
Yes.

127
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm waiting for your order.

128
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,120
Good.

129
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,960
Let's go.

130
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,720
Hurry up.

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,040
Aren't they worth it?

132
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Doctor Lin.

133
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,720
Stillmetros down?

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Don't worry.

135
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,420
I just heard from the soldiers that General Qi has brought his troops back to the city

136
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,620
to destroy the pirates in the city.

137
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,920
It's not just General Qi.

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
Lu Yi just woke up.

139
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,720
When he heard that there was a crisis in Hang City

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,520
he went to the city in front of General Qi.

141
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Isn't it dangerous for the people in the city?

142
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
I know that you miss him.

143
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm here. You can go.

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

145
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Please.

146
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Jin Xia, wait for me.

147
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Go!

148
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Go!

149
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Go!

150
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Jin Xia

151
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Madam, it's dawn.

152
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Yes, we've stayed up all night.

153
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Thank you for your hard work.

154
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
It's not easy to be a hero.

155
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
How can we talk about hard work?

156
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm just worried that

157
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,720
when the sun rises, the pirates will be able to see better the situation on the city wall.

158
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
It'll be hard for us to keep our eyes on them.

159
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
That makes sense.

160
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
If they can understand our background and attack us

161
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
we don't know how long we can hold back.

162
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,720
We don't know if General Qi knows our situation.

163
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
I don't know if we can come back in time.

164
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
No matter if you can come back

165
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,720
even if I'm the only one left in this city

166
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I must keep my hands on it.

167
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
We've prepared everything.

168
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
We'll leave as soon as you order.

169
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Has Wang Mazi sent the signal?

170
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Not yet.

171
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
I won't wait any longer.

172
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Attack!

173
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Yes!

174
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
They're here.

175
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Pass my order!

176
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Protect Hangzhou City with our lives!

177
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Prepare to fight the enemy!

178
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes!

179
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Protect Hangzhou City with our lives!

180
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Yes!

181
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Protect Hangzhou City with our lives!

182
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Protect Hangzhou City with our lives!

183
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Prepare to fight the enemy!

184
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Attack!

185
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Yes!

186
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Attack!

187
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Yes!

188
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Attack!

189
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Yes!

190
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Attack!

191
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Yes!

192
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Attack!

193
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Attack!

194
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Yes!

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Attack!

196
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Are you scared?

197
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
There are so many people here.

198
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm not scared.

199
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Attack!

200
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Fire!

201
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Yes!

202
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Fire!

203
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Fire!

204
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Come on!

205
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Madam!

206
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Fire the cannons!

207
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Madam, we have eight cannons now!

208
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Catch them all!

209
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Madam, we're out of bullets.

210
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
What should we do?

211
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
We must retreat for the first attack.

212
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Only then can we shoot them down.

213
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Yes!

214
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Do you have any fire cannons?

215
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Fire cannons!

216
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Sir, be careful of the guns!

217
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Be careful of the guns!

218
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Help! Help!

219
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Help!

220
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Sir!

221
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Help!

222
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Take her away!

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Yes!

224
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Stop!

225
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Stop!

226
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Stop!

227
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Sir, you're great!

228
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Sir!

229
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
What's going on?

230
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
What's going on?

231
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Sir, the firepower in Hangzhou is very strong.

232
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
We just fought and they attacked us with cannons.

233
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
It seems that there are reinforcements in the city.

234
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Useless!

235
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
You're all useless!

236
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
No.

237
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
There must be something wrong with this.

238
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Find two more people to go to the high ground

239
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
and check the situation in the city.

240
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Remember, you must check it carefully.

241
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Yes!

242
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Be careful.

243
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Be careful.

244
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Be careful.

245
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Drink some water.

246
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Drink some water.

247
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Drink some water.

248
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Drink some water.

249
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Drink some water.

250
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Drink some water.

251
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Yu Dayong is waiting for the food.

252
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Of course he must be happy.

253
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Otherwise, the soldiers in the army will starve.

254
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
How can we fight?

255
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Most of the soldiers in the city are family members of the Ming army.

256
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
If we attack Hangzhou now,

257
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
it will be difficult for the brothers in Ceng Gang to retreat.

258
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Wait for me.

259
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
I don't know how is the situation in the city.

260
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Are you hurt?

261
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
By the yearceksinter征商

262
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Do you regret doing this?

263
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Why I should regret?

264
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm proud to stand with

265
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,600
Madam, we've used up all the gunpowder.

266
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,040
If the pirates attack again,

267
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,520
we'll be in a dilemma.

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,880
What should we do?

269
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,840
If they come again, we'll be in a dilemma.

270
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,160
They'll fight with us.

271
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,840
We don't know what to do.

272
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,880
So many people are injured.

273
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,480
Listen to me.

274
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,680
Before, when we were out of weapons and bullets,

275
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,240
we heard that the pirates were going to attack the city.

276
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,040
We didn't even think that we could defeat the pirates.

277
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,840
But we did it just now.

278
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,240
Why?

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,120
Because we have the same faith.

280
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,400
We want to protect Hang City and our home.

281
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,520
Even if we don't have gunpowder,

282
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,400
we still have a knife, a sword, and ten pieces.

283
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,520
And a brick.

284
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,320
As long as we have hope,

285
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,080
I believe that Mrs. Qi will protect Hang City for us.

286
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,160
Jin Xia is right.

287
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,960
I also believe that as long as Mrs. Qi is on our side,

288
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,240
we can protect Hang City.

289
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
Believe in Mrs. Qi!

290
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,400
Believe in Mrs. Qi!

291
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,400
Mrs. Qi!

292
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,280
Mrs. Qi!

293
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,240
Mrs. Qi!

294
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,240
Mrs. Qi!

295
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,240
Mrs. Qi!

296
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,200
Mrs. Qi!

297
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,120
Mrs. Qi!

298
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
Mrs. Qi!

299
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,000
Mrs. Qi!

300
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,000
Mrs. Qi!

301
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,000
Mrs. Qi!

302
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
Mrs. Qi!

303
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:57,700
Related to

304
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,040
Later on,

305
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,560
and then

306
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:08,600
and then

307
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I will use my strength to destroy the rebellion

308
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
and bring peace to the people.

309
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
The people will be safe and the country will be safe.

310
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I have already kept my name.

311
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Today, the pirates are coming to the city.

312
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,600
General Qi Huo Xi will definitely come back in a rush.

313
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
As long as I am in the city for one day,

314
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
even if I am the last breath,

315
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
the last drop of blood,

316
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I will hold on until General comes back.

317
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
No matter what happens,

318
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I will never surrender!

319
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Never surrender!

320
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
General, I have already seen the soldiers on the city wall.

321
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
There are only a dozen men.

322
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
The rest are all women.

323
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Really?

324
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Absolutely.

325
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I can see it clearly.

326
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It was Qu Huo who was the one who found out.

327
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Mrs. Qi is a woman.

328
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
She is a woman.

329
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
She is a woman.

330
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
She is a woman.

331
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
She is a woman.

332
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
She is a woman.

333
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Qu Huo?

334
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Mrs. Qi is a cunning woman.

335
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
She used an empty city trap.

336
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
If I had known,

337
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
you would have been able to kill her in one moment.

338
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Pass my order.

339
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
All troops, set out!

340
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
I don't believe that we can't attack Hangzhou.

341
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Yes!

342
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Set out!

343
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Yes!

344
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Yes!

345
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Yes!

346
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
All troops, set out!

347
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Yes!

348
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Yes!

349
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Yes!

350
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Yes!

351
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Yes!

352
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Yes!

353
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Yes!

354
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Yes!

355
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Yes!

356
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Yes!

357
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Oh no, the pirates have started attacking the city.

358
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,200
I wonder how long the people in the city can hold on.

359
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,800
Sir, General Qi and the others are here.

360
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Hurry!

361
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,400
Hurry!

362
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Hurry!

363
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,400
We're speeding up. They won't be able to hold on.

364
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,600
The situation is very critical right now.

365
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
Let's go.

366
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Hurry!

367
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Miss Min, how are you?

368
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
You two, take him back to the city to rescue.

369
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Liang, let's go.

370
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Hurry!

371
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Hurry!

372
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Go!

373
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Hurry!

374
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Madam, they won't be able to hold on.

375
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
All soldiers, listen to my order!

376
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
The pirates are attacking the city!

377
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Yes!

378
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Kill them!

379
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Kill them!

380
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Kill them!

381
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Kill them!

382
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Kill them!

383
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Kill them!

384
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Kill them!

385
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Kill them!

386
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Kill them!

387
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Kill them!

388
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Kill them!

389
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Kill them!

390
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Kill them!

391
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Kill them!

392
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
It's a good thing they're here.

393
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Kill them!

394
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
You want to die?

395
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Shut up!

396
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Hurry and go!

397
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Yes!

398
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Hurry!

399
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Hurry!

400
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Hurry!

401
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Hurry!

402
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Hurry!

403
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Hurry!

404
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Hurry!

405
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Madam, you've worked hard.

406
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,800
General, I didn't protect the people well.

407
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,800
I believe that as long as you're here,

408
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Hangzhou City will be able to hold on until the last moment.

409
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Sir!

410
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Sir!

411
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Sir!

412
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Sir!

413
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Sir!

414
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Sir!

415
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Sir!

416
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Sir!

417
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Yang Yue!

418
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
It's okay.

419
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,800
You only have these words when you see me.

420
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,200
I... I'm so happy that I don't know what to say.

421
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,800
You didn't miss me, miss me, or worry about me?

422
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,200
I did. I did.

423
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,600
Why didn't you say it if you did?

424
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,800
I wanted to say it, but I said it countless times in my heart.

425
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
But when I see you, I can't say it out.

426
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Silly.

427
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,600
I miss you.

428
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,000
I miss you every moment that I see you.

429
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm worried about you.

430
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm worried that I'll never see you again.

431
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm worried that we've been gone for so long,

432
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,800
but we can't mend our bond.

433
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,600
I'm holding you now.

434
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,800
We should never separate again.

435
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,400
Your Majesty.

436
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
Your Majesty,

437
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,600
the war report from the front line is that the battle at Cengang is a disaster.

438
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

439
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,200
Good. Good.

440
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,600
What Steward Lan said is really accurate.

441
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,800
The proposal of the Qu's Mansion is indeed effective.

442
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Good. Good.

443
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,400
Good.

444
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Yes.

445
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,200
General Yu is a great winner.

446
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,400
It's really a merit for His Majesty to be here.

447
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,200
Give my order.

448
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,400
Yes.

449
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,200
All the soldiers who have made contributions will be rewarded.

450
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,400
I obey your order.

451
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm here, Minister Lu.

452
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,800
The battle at Cengang is a disaster.

453
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Minister Lu, you're back safely.

454
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,600
You don't need to worry about it.

455
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
The stone in my heart

456
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,400
is also in place.

457
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,800
Thanks to your kindness,

458
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,600
I heard from Eunuch Li that

459
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,400
His Majesty is in danger for the safety of his son.

460
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,600
He might have left after Lu Yi returned safely.

461
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,200
Lu Yi is really capable.

462
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,000
He made His Majesty worried and was really weak.

463
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,600
Minister Lu,

464
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,000
although I'm a military official,

465
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I always think of you as my own brother.

466
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

467
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,200
As for Lu Yi,

468
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,800
he's my own son.

469
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,200
Lu Yi has made great contributions.

470
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
When he returns to the court,

471
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,200
I'll reward him.

472
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Your Majesty,

473
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,800
the battle at Cengang is not only Lu Yi's merit.

474
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,600
It's the result of the unity of the army and the people.

475
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,400
His Majesty has done a great favor to Lu Yi.

476
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,000
You shouldn't blame Lu Yi.

477
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,600
You...

478
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,800
I'm talking about family affairs with you.

479
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,000
You're always serious.

480
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,600
Since that's the case,

481
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,000
let's talk about business.

482
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Li Dayong has surrounded the pirates for many years.

483
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,400
In the end, the pirates are in the southeast.

484
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Many people want to impeach him

485
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,200
to deliberately smuggle the thieves.

486
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,600
But this time,

487
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Lu Yi went there

488
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,200
to let him attack Cengang.

489
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
I've thought about it

490
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
and thought about it.

491
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,200
What's your opinion?

492
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Your Majesty,

493
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
as far as I know,

494
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Yu Dayong is fully focused on the military.

495
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,400
He won't be distracted by the new plan.

496
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
You mean Yu Dayong

497
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
doesn't have any second thoughts about me?

498
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Your Majesty,

499
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm just talking about evidence.

500
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
As for whether it's true,

501
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
I dare not say it.

502
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,000
Liao Wenhua is corrupting the military.

503
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,800
I've dismissed him.

504
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,600
I order you to destroy all his corruption.

505
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
I obey your order.

506
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,400
Childe,

507
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,200
Dong Qisheng attacked Hangzhou.

508
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,600
Qi Weigang captured him.

509
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,800
I heard he's going to be executed by Wu Shouxu.

510
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Send someone to deal with him.

511
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,400
I'll do it right away.

512
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
Wait.

513
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,800
I heard that Luo Wenlong is still in Mrs. Qi's hands.

514
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,000
Send someone to get him out.

515
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And that Chun Yumin.

516
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,600
Since he can't kill Yuan Jinxia,

517
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,000
there's no need to keep him alive.

518
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,600
Yes, Childe.

519
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
How is it going, Aunt?

520
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,000
Are you okay?

521
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Could it be that the old injury

522
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,400
is relapsing because of the previous injury?

523
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,800
Childe, can you be a little bit more careful?

524
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Look at her. She's all bruised.

525
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,400
She's sleeping well.

526
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,200
She's fine.

527
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,600
Uncle, look at her pale face. How can she be fine?

528
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
It's okay. The wound on her arm is not relapsed.

529
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Next, she'll just rest.

530
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
Then why did she faint?

531
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Because she was running around.

532
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,400
She was too tired and fell asleep.

533
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Fell asleep?

534
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,800
What? You don't believe me?

535
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,400
If you don't believe me, I'll wake her up.

536
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
No, no.

537
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
I believe you.

538
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,600
Then Uncle, Aunt, you go back and rest.

539
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,000
I'll guard the old man's place.

540
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,800
This girl is really nice.

541
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,000
Look at her. She cares about me.

542
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm really touched.

543
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
When did you treat me like this?

544
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,600
Okay, okay. Let's go.

545
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Let's go.

546
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,960
Officers in属 WAT

547
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,400
Father!

548
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,200
You have to save my son!

549
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
The Royal Palace...

550
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,000
to make sauce is the best.

551
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,800
It shouldn't have done this!

552
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,200
If His Majesty blames me,

553
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,660
I must Be

554
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,640
I said bad words to you

555
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
I forgot

556
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,920
You came back to me

557
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,320
when something happened

558
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,440
How can I help you?

559
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,320
Father

560
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,280
I was wrong

561
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,680
I also admit my mistake

562
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,520
Father

563
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,800
If you can bear it

564
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,760
you won't see me ugly, right?

565
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,200
Father

566
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,800
His Majesty favors you the most

567
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,960
If you say more

568
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,640
he will believe you

569
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,080
Father

570
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,640
Since you have been released

571
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,720
you should go back to your hometown

572
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,280
I will choose

573
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,480
the court matters

574
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,160
Thank you, father

575
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,920
Thank you, father

576
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,280
Thank you, father

577
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
Thank you, father

578
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,120
Father

579
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,680
You are awake

580
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,280
How are you?

581
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,120
Feel better?

582
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,280
Why didn't you wake me up?

583
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,400
What happened?

584
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,640
You didn't wake up

585
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm fine

586
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,080
You look pale

587
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,320
Why do you look at me?

588
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,560
Something on my face?

589
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Don't move.

590
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,120
Be careful of the wound.

591
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,000
It will be troublesome for you to come back again.

592
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,320
Is Dr. Lin back?

593
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,040
You are so badly injured.

594
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,040
Why do you still come back?

595
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,760
Because I'm worried about you.

596
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,640
I'm worried about the war, the knife, the wall, the house, and Shangjing.

597
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,920
I'm worried about the pirates, the assassins, and the killers.

598
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,040
I'm worried that everyone will be destroyed.

599
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,800
You are still waiting for me.

600
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,560
Of course I will wait for you.

601
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,880
But I won't be so stupid that I don't even want my life.

602
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
But I can.

603
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm touched.

604
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,880
I'm sorry.

605
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,160
Jinxia.

606
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,720
Can you play a song for me?

607
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,920
Why do you suddenly want to hear a song?

608
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,160
When I was sleeping,

609
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,560
I had a dream.

610
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,760
I dreamed that I had met a little girl.

611
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,720
What kind of little girl?

612
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,240
I'll tell you when I'm done.

613
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,840
You can sing a song I used to sing when I was a kid.

614
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,200
One, two, three, three, two, one.

615
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,040
Seven stars shine.

616
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,560
Seven stars guide the direction.

617
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,160
One, two, three, three, two, one.

618
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

619
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,120
Seven stars shine.

620
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,920
Seven stars guide the direction.

621
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,480
The cake is East is the spring.

622
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,040
The cake is South is the summer.

623
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,440
The cake is West is the autumn.

624
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,600
The cake is North is the East.

625
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,600
One, two, three, three, two, one.

626
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

627
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,600
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

628
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,240
Seven stars shine.

629
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,600
Is it nice?

630
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,120
I'll read it for you.

631
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:58,320
Who has conquered the world?

632
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,520
No sound.

633
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,920
The sound of the flute.

634
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,160
Fate turns.

635
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,520
Seeing through the changes in life.

636
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,680
Like parting.

637
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,480
The parting is too deep.

638
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,120
There will be years ahead.

639
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,680
When I meet you,

640
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,280
I'll grow old soon.

641
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,760
So that I can lose myself with you.

642
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,800
In the end, I'll say goodbye with a smile.
