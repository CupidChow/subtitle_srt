YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeat is still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate twice

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ooh

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ooh

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ooh

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ooh

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ooh

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Seven stars come to light up

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Seven stars guide the direction

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Doubing east is spring

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Doubing south is summer

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Doubing west is autumn

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Doubing north is winter

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
One two three

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Three two one

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
One two three four five six seven

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Seven six five four three two one

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Seven stars come to light up

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Does it sound good?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll read it for you

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Read it

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Seven stars come to light up

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Seven stars guide the direction

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Ling

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's wrong?

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Brother Yang

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What happened?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When I was delivering the medicine to Lu Yi

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I heard Jin Xia sing a song

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This song was written by my sister

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We taught the child to sing

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Did you hear it wrong?

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, I heard it very clearly

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There won't be any mistakes

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It may be a coincidence

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe your sister taught someone else

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Maybe someone else heard it

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And learned it

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Impossible

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Only my sister and I know this song

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No one else knows it

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Brother Yang, tell me

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is Jin Xia my sister's child?

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is she my sister's child?

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How could it be Jin Xia?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Ling, I told you

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your sister's child was kidnapped by a human trafficker

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You have to believe me

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's late, go back and rest

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are wrong

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You are wrong

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Maybe you have some reasons

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You don't want to tell me

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But it doesn't matter

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I will find out the truth

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will find out the truth

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
One, two, three

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Three, two, one

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Seven stars shine

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Seven stars guide the direction

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The east is the spring

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The south is the summer

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The west is the autumn

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The north is the winter

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
One, two, three

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Three, two, one

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She is asleep

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sister, tell me

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is Jinxia your child?

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Lord Xu

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Priest Lan

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Please

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think Yan Song didn't expect that

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Liao Wenhua was expelled

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and died in the way back home

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Liao Wenhua is brave but he doesn't dare to be

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I heard that the emperor wanted to punish him

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
but he died

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We are one less opponent

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
after Liao Wenhua died

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Lord Xu, if you need anything in the future

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
just tell me

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If he is not mature enough

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and doesn't have any new moves

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
we should be more careful

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
in case Yan Dang notices it

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and we will be in a tight spot

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Although we failed to defeat Yan Dang

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm afraid Liao Wenhua's reputation

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
will be ruined

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The first one to be expelled

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
should be Wu Shouxu

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Aunt Lin

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Aunt Lin

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Jinxia

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Come, have some chicken soup

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You must be tired from taking care of the wounded

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I saw you were in a bad mood yesterday

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I asked Dayang to make chicken soup for you

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
to nourish your body

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Jinxia, thank you

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are welcome

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I always see you as my own family

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You are an elder

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
but you treat me so well

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't think you can do it

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
By the way

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the song you sang yesterday

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
where did you learn it?

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Tong...

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You mean the seven stars in Beidou?

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I learned it in the hall

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hall?

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My mother brought me back from the hall

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Who taught you to sing in the hall?

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Who else can do it?

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I really don't remember who taught me

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Anyway, all the kids in the hall can do it

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's wrong, Aunt Lin?

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You know this song, too?

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This song

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
is a very important person in my life

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What a coincidence!

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where is he now?

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He has passed away

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I sang this song

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and reminded you of your old friend

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's okay

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thanks to you

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can remember him

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's been so many years

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can't remember his face

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Aunt Lin, don't be sad

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you're like this

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
your old friend in heaven

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
will be sad

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Drink the chicken soup

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It won't taste good when it gets cold

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Where is the medicine?

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's for Xie Xiao

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll send it to him

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is it ready now?

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll take it out

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Take it out

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It must be bitter

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Take it

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Drink the chicken soup

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The light and the dull

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
can be a beautiful lake

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Its day and night

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
is filled with lightness

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Its beauty...

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I heard that two heroes

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
have broken their records

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hero

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tell me about your battle field

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Warrior Yuan

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Can you knock on the door?

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Can you be more reserved?

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why are you shy

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
today?

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I think you're not only

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
injured

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
but also hurt your brain

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Who said I was injured?

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Who?

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Who slanders me like this?

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's not a shame

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to be injured

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why can't I let others know?

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let me see your wound

195
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No, no, no

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What?

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Is this my wound?

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,040
You think I'm under the

199
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,000
treacherous fire of the pirates

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not afraid of death

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll use the water thunder

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
to destroy the pirates' old nest

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and turn the war machine around

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is this wound?

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is honor

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But I heard that

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
someone almost died

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If it wasn't for your effort

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
you would have died

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't need to save that person

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I can't save Lu

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If he didn't drag me

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
would I be injured?

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Listen

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm the most powerful

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
in this battle

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
When I was badly injured

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and killed by the pirates

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Lu was waiting for me

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
to save him

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I used my power

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
to protect him

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
with my own life

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It must be

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Lord Lu who lied to me

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He told me

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
you were begging

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
to owe him a life

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Fine

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I admit that he saved me

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How can he do it

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
without my help?

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Lord did say that

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you did the most merit

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If he didn't help you

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
he couldn't do it alone

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
See, that's right

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How can he win

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
without me?

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Right?

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Xie Yuanyuan

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I really admire you

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Of course

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You didn't have a chance

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
to see my ability

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Think about it

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Two years ago

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I was wandering around

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and fought against the black coffins

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
with Brother Sha

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I helped the poor

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I was so proud

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
how many people admired me

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hero Xie

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Even if you are a rich man

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
whether it's a black coffins or a white coffins

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you are just a robber

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You are breaking the law

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How dare you say that in front of a rich man?

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Aren't you afraid that

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I will arrest you and punish you?

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Those black coffins

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
won't admit it

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you do this again

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
don't tell me

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Here, take the medicine

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What? What's wrong?

269
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's bitter

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Bitter is a good medicine

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's ok

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's ok

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I told aunt Lin

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
not to make medicine with you anymore

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Otherwise, you will be in pain

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I will drink it

277
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Does it hurt?

278
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's a fist

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Take a good rest

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know what to do

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am in pain

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I see that

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
the emperor is so happy

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The two families are in a good mood

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I think that

286
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the emperor has been

287
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
in a good mood recently

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He is in a good mood

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But the recovery of Ceng Gang

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
has finished me

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's a big deal

293
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I feel relieved

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I feel much better

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I am so surprised

296
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I didn't expect it

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I am flattered

298
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I just want to tell you

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The emperor has been practicing

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The emperor will be back

301
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But now

302
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Ceng Gang is in a bad mood

303
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The two families are in a mess

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Liao Wenhua is dead

305
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The army is back

306
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But in my case

307
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the most important thing is

308
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the report of Tan He and Wu Shouxu

309
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Many people have doubts

310
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
about Wu Shouxu

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Lu Aiqing, what do you think?

312
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Your Majesty

313
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a big deal

314
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't dare to say it

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I think we can

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
leave it to the cabinet

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Lord Yan and Lord Xu

318
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
will give you

319
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
a satisfactory answer

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Forget it

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You

322
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You are so clean

323
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a waste to ask you

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Li Fang

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Take care of him

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Father, you want to see me?

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You are here

330
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Come and see

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The imperial edict just sent by the emperor

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It seems that

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the report of Tan He and Wu Shouxu

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
has been effective

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The emperor has decided

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to withdraw the post of governor

337
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The emperor means

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
to withdraw Wu Shouxu

339
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but there is no suitable candidate

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let me recommend someone

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm going to

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
be selected by you

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Father

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The emperor doesn't want you

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to recommend a candidate

346
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He has already

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
decided the candidate

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He wants to ask you

349
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The aunt here

350
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
refers to the imperial censor Wang Yi

351
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The emperor wants Wang Yi

352
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
to replace Wu Shouxu

353
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Father

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You don't have to recommend a candidate

355
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You just need to follow the emperor's will

356
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There will be no mistake

357
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Go

358
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Aunt Lin, how is she?

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
She was weak in the beginning

361
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's not easy for her

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to survive until now

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
She has something to tell you

364
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jinxia

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Big brother

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I know I'm dying

367
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is the retribution I deserve

368
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What retribution?

369
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Don't talk nonsense

370
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Jinxia

371
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Listen to me

372
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I saw you and Mrs. Qi

373
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
these days

374
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I just found out

375
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that women can live like this

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I really envy you

377
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You can face difficulties so bravely

378
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm so happy

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to see you

380
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm so happy

381
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
To face difficulties

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I envy you more

383
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You live so freely

384
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And you have a group of friends

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
who stand up for you

386
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You are a good girl

387
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I have done so many things

388
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that hurt you

389
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I hate myself

390
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Miss Lin

391
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry

392
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Miss Lin

393
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Miss Lin

394
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Miss Lin

395
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
She's gone

396
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Maybe it's the biggest relief for her

397
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sorry

398
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Zengfu

399
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
bury Ming'er

400
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes

401
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I hope she can be free in the next life

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Your Majesty

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is the reply from Yan Ge

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Read it

405
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The officials are talented

407
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't run away from the holy sword

408
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Help the people to be wise

409
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I dare not doubt

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The one who knows the battle

411
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yan Songye

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Good

413
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Good

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Your Excellency

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Your Excellency, you are dying

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I was wondering why you were not in the room

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You were practicing martial arts here

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm fine

419
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What?

420
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You don't know your injury is serious?

421
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I should move more because of the injury

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's good for recovery

423
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I know my injury

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You don't have to worry

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What's your excuse?

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You should rest when you are injured

427
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can recover fast

428
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Come on, drink the medicine

429
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You feed me

430
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why do you need me to feed you?

431
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Maybe I was not able to stand up

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
because of the practice

433
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I can't even lift my arm

434
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Stop lying

435
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Really

436
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Really

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The wound may be broken

438
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Let me see

439
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's okay

440
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's just a small injury

441
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I told you not to move

442
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You are so annoying

443
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Come on, drink the medicine

444
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
After you drink the medicine

445
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you should go back to your room

446
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and have a good rest

447
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Don't move

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Don't move

449
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Sir

450
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What's up?

451
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
General Yu is here

452
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
General Yu is here?

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Let's go, I'll take you to see him

454
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Drink the medicine first

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The last sip

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, sit down

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
General, you are back

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Brother Lu

459
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Are you feeling better?

460
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Thank you for your concern

461
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I am fine now

462
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's good

463
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
General

464
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I am fine now

465
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I am fine now

466
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I am fine now

467
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's good

468
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
General

469
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This is Yuan Jin Xia

470
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Jin Xia

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yu Dayong, General Yu

472
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Miss Yuan

473
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I have heard that you are a man of great martial arts

474
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I am so honored to meet you

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Miss Yuan, you are too kind

476
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You are the one that Mrs. Qi mentioned

477
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,120
the one who can stop the female

478
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I am here to see Brother Lu's injury

479
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Secondly

480
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Mr. Wu has given me a lot of instructions

481
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
He asked me to tell the members of the Six Faction Sect

482
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to come here

483
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Miss Yuan

484
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Where are the other members?

485
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
General, please wait

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'll go and ask Master and the others to come here

487
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Okay

488
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
General, please

489
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Please

490
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I heard that General Qi has captured Dong Qisheng

491
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes

492
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
He has already been handed over to Mr. Wu

493
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
He is now in the prison of the capital

494
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
General, I want to see him

495
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay

496
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll arrange it

497
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You can go now

498
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes

499
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll go now

500
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'll go now

501
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll go now

502
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll go now

503
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll arrange it

504
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
General Yi

505
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yang Li

506
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Brother

507
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Brother

508
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Brother

509
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's really you

510
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yang Li

511
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You have no news after you left

512
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I have missed you for a long time

513
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You even asked me to find you

514
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I didn't expect to see you here today

515
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We are not meant to be

516
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes

517
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Master, he...

518
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
After you left

519
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Master has been missing you

520
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He took me to find you

521
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But he had no reason

522
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
He kept missing your name

523
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
until he died

524
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I feel sorry for him

525
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay

526
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's all in the past

527
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If he knew it

528
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
he would forgive you

529
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So he and General Yu are old friends

530
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and they agreed to be a family

531
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes

532
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes

533
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He said he would enter the capital

534
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and get a title

535
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He even changed his name when he left

536
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
At first, we knew you were in the imperial guard

537
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But we didn't know you were there

538
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Brother

539
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's all in the past

540
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Forget it

541
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Let me introduce you

542
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yu

543
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This is your uncle

544
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This is Yang Yue

545
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Hello, uncle

546
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Don't stand on ceremony

547
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You are a child

548
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yes

549
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Time flies

550
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
This is my apprentice Yuan Jinxia

551
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Uncle

552
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Okay

553
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I like your apprentice

554
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He is more beautiful than me

555
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The Empress Dowager's Residence

556
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Young Master

557
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yan Shaoqiong is here

558
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Young Master

559
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
What do you want?

560
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Young Master

561
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You falsely claimed the name of Yan Shang, Sima Chang'an

562
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and dug up the mine in Hangzhou

563
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Now it's a mess

564
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Although the government has sealed the Sima Mansion

565
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Sima Chang'an has been imprisoned

566
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But his name is out

567
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
As the president of the Four Salt Depots

568
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I will be involved

569
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Young Master

570
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Please think of a way

571
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
If His Majesty blames us

572
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You, the Four Salt Depots

573
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
can charge 400,000 taels of salt tax every year

574
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Why would His Majesty

575
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
take your position because of a small salt merchant?

576
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Can't you get along with Ku Ying?

577
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Besides

578
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Father and I are with His Majesty

579
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What are you afraid of?

580
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm worried

581
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
About what?

582
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
About my selling you

583
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I dare not

584
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Enough

585
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Go back and be your Four Salt Depots

586
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't bother me with these important things

587
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you for your advice

588
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Young Master, you're so smart

589
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
When will you finish the mine I told you to build?

590
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It will be completed in a short time

591
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Hurry up

592
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It will be completed before the treasures in Hangzhou are delivered

593
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Don't worry, Young Master

594
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I will make it happen

595
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Zhi Han

596
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Sir

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
How is it?

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Did Dong Jisheng confess?

599
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No

600
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He didn't

601
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But

602
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He offered to let himself go

603
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
as a replacement

604
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Send the tiger back to the mountain?

605
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
How is that possible?

606
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's clear that

607
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
he is colluding with Mao Haifeng

608
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It seems that

609
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the food and food case

610
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
must be found by Yan Shi Fan

611
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
who was mentioned by Mr. Lu

612
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
to find the truth

613
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The Imperial Guards have sent people to investigate

614
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But the whereabouts are unknown

615
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
In this situation

616
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
it's likely that he has been killed

617
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Forget it

618
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
As long as he is brought back to the capital

619
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
the court will stop

620
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
the talk about me

621
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
At least

622
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
my internal worries

623
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
can be solved for the time being

624
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Mr. Wu

625
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Do you really think that there is no danger?

626
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Mao Haifeng has started a war

627
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
to rebel in the southeast

628
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The ambitious people

629
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
will surely come to the rear

630
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We have to be careful

631
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Mr. Lu's opinion

632
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
is exactly what I want to say

633
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,040
The

634
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,000
chaos of the Japanese is not

635
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
easily eliminated

636
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
These weapons

637
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
were collected

638
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
from the military camp by General Yu

639
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I just checked

640
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Most of the weapons

641
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
have the symbol of the Japanese

642
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Obviously, it was provided by the Japanese

643
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Since the Japanese can support Mao Haifeng

644
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
they can support others

645
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Mr. Wu

646
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I have always been very well-educated

647
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in the fire department

648
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I wonder if you

649
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
can let me take back a bird's nest

650
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and study it

651
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Please do

652
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Sister Shen Wen

653
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What are you doing?

654
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm going to the capital

655
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What are you doing?

656
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I thought you were just practicing martial arts

657
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I didn't expect you to know how to do the female martial arts

658
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I admire you

659
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It's my first time to try it

660
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I've never done it before

661
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You can sew it so delicately

662
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's amazing

663
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Dayang is really lucky

664
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Don't praise me

665
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm not as good as Dayang

666
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's okay if he doesn't dislike it

667
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
How can he dislike it?

668
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
He's too happy to be late

669
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Sister

670
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Dayang is an honest person

671
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
He may be a little bit

672
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
ignorant of his daughter's feelings

673
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Please forgive him

674
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He is indeed ignorant

675
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
He is not as clever as Mr. Lu

676
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
He knows how to look down on his daughter

677
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Why did you mention Mr. Lu?

678
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I think you and Mr. Lu

679
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
don't have a normal relationship

680
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Look at each other's eyes

681
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's different

682
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Really?

683
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I can't hide it from you

684
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But Mr. Lu and I

685
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
are not as good as you and Dayang

686
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We can be together without any worries

687
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Lu is a high-ranking official

688
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm just a small supplement

689
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't have a fancy family

690
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
My master also said

691
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I have a different identity from you

692
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I should stay away from you

693
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
What does he mean?

694
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
He said he didn't care about the family

695
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't know

696
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I don't know

697
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
According to Mr. Lu

698
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
he said he didn't care

699
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He must have no family

700
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I believe him

701
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So even if the future is full of unknown

702
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm not afraid

703
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Cherish the future

704
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Who knows the future?

705
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Aunt Lin

706
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Aunt Lin, come and have a look

707
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Sister Shangguan is sewing clothes for Dayang

708
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Let's see how she does it

709
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Let me see

710
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's her first time

711
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Look

712
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The thread is a little crooked

713
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's not the same size

714
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Let me teach you

715
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's really the same

716
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I just know a little

717
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You're too modest

718
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Dr. Lin

719
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You're so good at it

720
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You should teach me more

721
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay

722
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Jinxia

723
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Why is your neck red?

724
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Did a mosquito sting you?

725
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm very sensitive to mosquitoes

726
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:48,960
My brothers in the Sixth

727
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Are you talking about the Seven Stars of Beidou?

728
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I learned it in the pond

729
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Pond

730
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
My mother took me back from the pond

731
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Aunt Lin

732
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What are you thinking?

733
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Nothing

734
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm a little confused

735
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Jinxia said she was an orphan

736
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's just a coincidence

737
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm not an orphan

738
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm not an orphan

739
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm not an orphan

740
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm not an orphan

741
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm not an orphan

742
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm not an orphan

743
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm not an orphan

744
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm not an orphan

745
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm not an orphan

746
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm not an orphan

747
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm not an orphan

748
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm not an orphan

749
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm not an orphan

750
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm not an orphan

751
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm not an orphan

752
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm not an orphan

753
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm not an orphan

754
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm not an orphan

755
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm not an orphan

756
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm not an orphan

757
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm not an orphan

758
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm not an orphan

759
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm not an orphan

760
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm not an orphan

761
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm not an orphan

762
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm not an orphan

763
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm not an orphan

764
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm not an orphan

765
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm not an orphan

766
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's the same

767
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The parts of Yan Shi Fan's mine

768
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
are stored here

769
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
No wonder he wants to hide his identity

770
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Ning Feng

771
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Add more people

772
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and open up the iron mine

773
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
we found before

774
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
We must keep up with the production

775
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
If the ore in the mine is mass-produced

776
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and the parts are used on the fire

777
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
the power of the fire

778
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
will be much greater

779
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's okay to dig the iron mine

780
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's a crime to create weapons

781
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
in the mine

782
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It seems that Yan Shi Fan

783
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and Mao Hai Feng

784
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
are related to this

785
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It seems that Yan Shi Fan

786
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and Mao Hai Feng

787
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Come, eat

788
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Great, the food is here

789
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The food is here

790
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Sir, sir

791
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Thank you, sir

792
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Thank you, sir

793
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Thank you, sir

794
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Come, eat

795
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Sir

796
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Sir, here

797
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Here, here

798
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Come, eat

799
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Sir, sir

800
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Here, put it here

801
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Thank you, sir

802
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Thank you, sir

803
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Come, eat

804
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Sir, I don't have it here

805
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Sir, sir

806
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Wait

807
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Sir, this way

808
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Here, yours

809
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Mine

810
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Come, eat

811
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Here, here, here

812
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Here you are

813
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Help, help

814
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Help

815
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Help

816
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Help

817
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Hurry, help

818
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Hurry, open the door

819
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
He's dead

820
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Report to the officer

821
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Report to the officer

822
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yes

823
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He's dead

824
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The two states are in chaos

825
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That's why the Shao family is at peace

826
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If this is to change the governor

827
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm afraid it will cause chaos

828
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Sir, the news just came

829
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Dong Qisheng died in the prison

830
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Died

831
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes, he was poisoned

832
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's not an accident

833
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
His death can do a lot of things

834
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It seems that Wu Shouxu wants to keep his position

835
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He has to put some effort into it

836
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Should we go and check

837
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Who poisoned Dong Qisheng

838
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Wu Shouxu has Xu Wei by his side

839
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Of course we will go and check

840
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But Dong Qisheng

841
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Died in the prison of the Governor's mansion

842
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It seems that the man in the mansion

843
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Has been arranged by someone

844
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'll go to the Governor's mansion

845
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'll go with you

846
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
No, I'll go by myself

847
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yes

848
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Sir, Dong Qisheng died in the prison

849
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Did he spit something out?

850
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's said that the man in Wu Shouxu's mansion

851
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Didn't do anything

852
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But he had a deal with Lu Yi

853
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He wanted to use a confession

854
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
To ask Lu Yi to release him

855
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Luckily, Luo Longwen acted in time

856
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Before he said anything

857
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
He killed him

858
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Lu Yi is not a fool

859
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Mao Haifeng ran away

860
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Wu Shouxu even wanted to use Dong Qisheng

861
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
To get the credit

862
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
How could he let him go so easily?

863
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Where is Zhai Lanye?

864
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Since Mao Haifeng burned down the mansion

865
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He has been missing

866
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
He will see people and dead people

867
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes

868
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
By the way, sir

869
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The man you asked to find has arrived

870
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Let him come here

871
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yes

872
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I've been looking for a long time

873
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I can't see it

874
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What's wrong with this painting?

875
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Sir

876
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
This painting is not a real one

877
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's just a copy

878
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Tell me

879
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
How can it be a copy?

880
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
From Wu Jiao

881
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We can know if it's a copy or not

882
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You are not Zhang Zhengdao

883
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
How can you know what the bird should draw?

884
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
If you say so

885
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's a fake

886
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
How can I believe you?

887
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Zhang Zhuo, who is the master of the Jinren's mansion

888
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He has studied the painting of Qingming Shanghe

889
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He has written a lot of details about Qingming Shanghe

890
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's written in this book

891
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Sir

892
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
About the real painting of Qingming Shanghe

893
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Many people don't know

894
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Song Huizong wrote it in the paper

895
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Zhang Zhengdao took it to the mansion after he finished it

896
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
After that

897
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Song Huizong did write the five thousand in the paper

898
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And added the Double Dragon Seal

899
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Then many people have many books

900
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Many people don't know that the real one is left out

901
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But the paper was removed

902
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You mean

903
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
If the real one doesn't have the poem

904
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The poem of the painting of Qingming Shanghe

905
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes

906
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Nianfeng, take him to get the reward

907
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yes

908
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Thank you

909
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Please

910
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Good

911
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You dare to lie to me with the fake one

912
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Huang Yu

913
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I can make you the official

914
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I can also make you die

915
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Sir, Mr. Lu is here

916
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Mr. Lu

917
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Mr. Lu

918
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I have heard about Dong Qisheng

919
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I have sent someone to investigate who did it

920
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
If the imperial guards want to take it

921
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I can ask Zhihang to give you the files

922
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I am here not to investigate Dong Qisheng's death

923
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But to remind you

924
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Although the situation in Cengang is serious

925
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But you may not be able to take the position of governor

926
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I know

927
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
You are in the army

928
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You are fighting against the pirates and are for the people

929
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
You have some prestige

930
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
If you are removed

931
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You will involve the soldiers in front

932
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Then the army will be unstable

933
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The pirates will be in danger

934
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The people will be in danger again

935
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Mr. Lu, you are not just here to remind me

936
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You must have a way to solve this problem

937
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Right?

938
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
The emperor likes to listen to the order of the heaven

939
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I think you know

940
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I have heard that in the Tiantai Mountain in Jiangzhe

941
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
There are often beasts in the mountain area

942
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Mr. Lu, you mean

943
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The Cengang Festival is a good thing for the emperor

944
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
The country is going to be prosperous

945
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If we can find a good thing

946
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
To offer to the emperor

947
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It will be a great success

948
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Then we will change the governor

949
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And we will reconsider

950
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's a good idea

951
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But the thing about the beast

952
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's just a rumor

953
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
We can only listen to the order of the heaven

954
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The heart is in a whirl

955
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
A thousand miles of ambush

956
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Who is born out of the world

957
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Can't beat fate

958
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Close your eyes, I can see your face

959
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Open your eyes, the north is cold

960
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The sword is full of sky

961
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Who has conquered the world

962
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
No sound, the dark is coming

963
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Fate is turning

964
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
See the change in the world

965
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Like farewell, farewell is too sad

966
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The yearning is golden

967
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
The day I met you

968
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
White hair from the old days

969
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We spent the years together

970
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
In the dream, a thousand years

971
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I want to tell you

972
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I want to tell you

973
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I want to tell you

974
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I want to tell you

975
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I want to tell you

976
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I want to tell you
