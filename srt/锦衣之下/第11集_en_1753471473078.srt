I will definitely make it this time

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
Catch the murderer early

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Hope to save enough money early

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Can find my real parents

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Rather than praying here

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560
Why don't you think about it

65
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,240
How to find a person who sings

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
Sir

67
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,720
what happened

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,920
You heard what I just said

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,440
heard

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
it is good

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,520
I didn't say anything wrong just now

72
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,320
Otherwise, I have to eat it all

73
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,600
You are an orphan

74
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,760
Actually this is not a secret

75
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,440
I lost myself when I was young

76
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,760
Disappear from family

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,800
I lived in Tangzi for a while

78
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Just adopted by my current mother

79
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Sir

80
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,720
Sir

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,040
I have a request

82
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,720
I don't know if I should say it

83
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,800
what's up

84
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,760
The Imperial Guards are very good at情报

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,080
Explore the world

86
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,080
If I perform well this time

87
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,480
If you catch the murderer early

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Can you help me

89
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,440
Find my real parents

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
I am the imperial guard

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,680
Should be blamed

92
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,720
How can you fake the sacrifice

93
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,760
Just the regent

94
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,160
What the regent

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
this body

96
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
like this

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,880
But the rules are men specified

98
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,920
You can also polynomialize

99
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,720
sir

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
Hurry up.

101
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I'm coming.

102
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,680
Let's go.

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,280
So heavy.

104
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,960
Jinxia, you're here.

105
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,360
Be careful.

106
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,440
What do you think about

107
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
the male students

108
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,840
chosen by the class leader?

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
I think Lu Shisan is good.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,680
What?

111
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,960
You're so stupid.

112
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,080
You're so annoying.

113
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,800
He just looks good

114
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
and thinks he's a talent.

115
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
I think you

116
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,240
like his face.

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,880
You...

118
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
You're annoying.

119
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,160
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
But...

121
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,400
To be honest,

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,800
I think Lu Shisan

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
is good-looking.

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
And his figure

125
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
is as good as his.

126
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,440
Look at you.

127
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,880
You're making fun of us.

128
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,120
You're a man who doesn't know

129
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,280
the evil.

130
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,920
You're always with Lu Shisan.

131
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,880
Of course you don't think so.

132
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,960
But now,

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
there are so many people

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
who look good like him.

135
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,400
That's right.

136
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Our Shisan is really good.

137
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,320
If you like him so much,

138
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
do you want me to ask him

139
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,120
for you?

140
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,280
Sure.

141
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,160
Maybe a couple can be together.

142
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
Great.

143
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm so angry.

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
What's wrong with you?

145
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,000
It's okay.

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,040
I don't know where it came from.

147
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,520
But my brother

148
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,600
is not as good as a woman.

149
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,480
He's hard to figure out.

150
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
He's not a good match.

151
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
And I heard

152
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,680
he has a crush on someone recently.

153
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,600
That's not what you said just now.

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Really?

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,920
I mean

156
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
you can't

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
control him.

158
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
We can't?

159
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,640
Who can?

160
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
You?

161
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,840
No, no, no.

162
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,080
Impossible.

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
I'm lucky if he can't control me.

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,440
Now,

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,960
to be honest,

166
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
do you also

167
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,800
love Lu Shisan?

168
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
Me?

169
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Love him?

170
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Him?

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
Is he in love with you?

172
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,440
How is that possible?

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,760
Oh my god.

174
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm so desperate to love him.

175
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,640
If so,

176
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,160
why do you mention it?

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,280
You're so different.

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,120
You're so different.

179
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,560
You want us to

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
give up on you, right?

181
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
That's right.

182
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,840
No, no, no.

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
No, no.

184
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,440
That's right.

185
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,600
No, no.

186
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,680
You're wronged, sisters.

187
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
You said no?

188
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,560
You said no?

189
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,440
You're wronged.

190
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,760
You're wronged.

191
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,480
You still deny it?

192
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Hurry up.

193
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,840
We'll forgive you.

194
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
Please forgive us, sisters.

195
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,640
I'll forgive you.

196
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,840
Please stay.

197
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
There's no end to this feast.

198
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,200
One day,

199
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
we'll meet again.

200
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Brother Sha,

201
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,680
we won't send you away.

202
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,360
See you.

203
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,320
See you.

204
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Goodbye.

205
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
Xie Xiang, you...

206
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,760
Senior sister,

207
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
you're drunk.

208
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Do you know why I stayed?

209
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,240
Isn't it for Wu Anbang?

210
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
Because Yuan Jinxia.

211
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,360
When I was bullied when I was a kid,

212
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
Master Yuan said he would take care of me.

213
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,840
At that time, I swore in my heart

214
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,120
that I would take care of him

215
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,520
when I got stronger.

216
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,280
Later, I saw Lu Yi

217
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,240
treat him like a servant.

218
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,920
And he had to check the case day and night.

219
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,240
I felt sorry for him.

220
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,360
Then I thought

221
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,240
he hurt himself

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,040
and protected me for Brother Sha.

223
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,760
How can I not cherish

224
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
such a woman?

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,520
You...

226
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,600
I just heard Brother Sha's words.

227
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
I made a decision.

228
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,240
What decision?

229
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
I want to protect Yuan Jinxia

230
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,080
for the rest of my life.

231
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,280
If Yuan Sha get badly hurt,

232
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,760
Yuan Jinxia also will be affected

233
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,920
with another man in the same way.

234
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,600
That would be beautiful.

235
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,800
Great.

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,960
Okay.

237
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,320
Lin Ruocheng

238
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,560
brought this here.

239
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,680
Lin Ruocheng's phone

240
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,220
FROM SIDOL

241
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,800
ex율

242
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
I didn't realize it's his dryer.

243
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,320
He can onlyise

244
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
when he looks at it,

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,320
Fine.

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,960
Fine.

247
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,520
I can enjoy it alone at last.

248
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Lu Shisan, did you see the leader in the pool?

249
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
No, what's wrong?

250
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
That's weird. I saw him go in.

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Okay, thanks. I'll go look for him again.

252
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Don't move.

253
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I...

254
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Who are you?

255
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Leader?

256
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Leader, what are you doing? This is a female pool.

257
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Stop talking nonsense.

258
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Tell me, who are you?

259
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Leader, I'm your new apprentice. Did you forget?

260
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Can you put down your knife and talk nicely?

261
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Looks like you're pretty tough.

262
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Okay, let me remind you.

263
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,600
That day, you sneaked into my room and took away a letter of mine.

264
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Right?

265
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Leader, I just got to the Spring Festival class and I wanted to go shopping.

266
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,600
When I entered, I saw that letter there.

267
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
It was really pretty. I wanted to take it back to study.

268
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm really sorry.

269
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Let me remind you again.

270
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
That day, when I went to the pool, did you follow me all the way

271
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
and took away the orchid I put there?

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
No, no, no. That was more of a coincidence.

273
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I sneaked into the pool and took away the orchid.

274
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
It was just that I'm a person who likes to hold things.

275
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Leader, what are you doing?

276
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Tell me the truth! I don't have time to talk nonsense with you!

277
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I... I'm telling the truth!

278
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
You!

279
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Sir!

280
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Jinxia!

281
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
You! You lied!

282
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Get out.

283
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I'll get out after I get the hairpin.

284
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
The clouds are with the wind,

285
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
the heart is turning, the heart is beating.

286
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,600
The wind is blowing, the heart is beating.

287
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,600
The wind is blowing, the heart is beating.

288
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,600
The heart is beating, the sky is full of red eyes.

289
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Whose wish is it that I dream of

290
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,600
and stand in the middle of eternity?

291
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I can hear

292
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,600
your heartbeat in my ears.

293
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
It's just a moment,

294
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
separated by two sides.

295
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,600
A eternity that I can never find again.

296
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I can see

297
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,600
your tears falling in my heart.

298
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm afraid that with a blink of an eye,

299
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,600
it will all disappear.

300
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Sir! Sir!

301
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Hurry and change.

302
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Who are you?

303
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
What are you doing?

304
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Let go of me!

305
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
How dare you!

306
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
You're insulting the government official.

307
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
You're going to pay for this!

308
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
So it's you two!

309
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
You're officials?

310
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
You're mixed with me, the West Class.

311
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Why should I believe you?

312
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Who knows if you're fake?

313
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
This is the Yangzhou government office.

314
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
If you don't believe me,

315
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
you can stay for a few more days.

316
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Government official?

317
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Why are you arresting me?

318
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
What crime did I commit?

319
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
What evidence do you have?

320
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Why are you so anxious?

321
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Fine.

322
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Then, let's talk about Yun Zhen and the other officials.

323
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Then, let's talk about Yun Zhe Yue.

324
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:14,300
That day, you secretly went to the

325
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Northboy Club to check it.

326
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Thus I advise you to respond well

327
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,800
so that you are spared from easy punishment for this.

328
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
Yun Zhe Yue wasoluble then.

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He regained his social status for a while,

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
got잇 hypothesis to fact that he died in an accident.

331
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,300
After many years,

332
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,600
whenever the Spring Mus fooled though,

333
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,100
someone else died the same way.

334
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,800
What bad luck!

335
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,000
Say me.

336
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Did you kill Yun Zhe Yue?

337
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Yun Zhe Yue died so strangely.

338
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,440
The government sent people to investigate for a long time,

339
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
but they didn't find anything.

340
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,720
How can you say that I did it?

341
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,360
I found this in Yun Zhe Yue's room by accident.

342
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,840
A body-slinging?

343
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
These days,

344
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,280
I've been learning from the leader for a few days.

345
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,720
I think...

346
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
the character,

347
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,680
rubbing powder,

348
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,400
changes all kinds of identities.

349
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,480
It's to tell people that

350
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,040
there are thousands of lives,

351
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,240
and that everything is impermanent.

352
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,120
It's to persuade people to follow their will and mind.

353
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,960
But,

354
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
it's a joke.

355
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,840
Over time,

356
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,080
it's easy to make people can't tell what's real and what's fake.

357
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
In reality,

358
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,080
it will naturally be a joke,

359
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,600
and completely forget

360
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,120
what the real character is.

361
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,480
If I guess it right,

362
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,720
you're Wu Ying Hua.

363
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
Life is like a play.

364
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,760
The play is like life.

365
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
I've been wandering for so many years.

366
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,640
Now,

367
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,880
I should let go.

368
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,960
You finally admit it.

369
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,160
I didn't kill him.

370
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,600
You didn't?

371
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,200
Then why did you sneak to the Wanderer's Garden to pay respects to him?

372
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,200
Also,

373
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,040
did you set up the magical wind chimes

374
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,280
that make people in the Wanderer's Garden?

375
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,000
My Lord.

376
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,160
If I tell the truth,

377
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
can you let go of me?

378
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,320
You're still greedy for conditions?

379
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,120
If you really kill him,

380
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,760
I can't protect you.

381
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,480
Tell me.

382
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,440
Really.

383
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,200
I really didn't kill Yun Zhe Yue.

384
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,760
Although I really wanted to kill him.

385
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,360
He's my senior.

386
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,640
We were together under the old sect leader of Chun Xi Sect.

387
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
My master gave us a name.

388
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,120
His name is Yun Zhe Yue,

389
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,120
it's Wu Ying Hua to me.

390
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,200
Wewow from college students

391
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,440
to train producing sunshine makes me complain.

392
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,640
We said

393
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,040
that we must become a pillar to Silversρχ.

394
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,200
Then,

395
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,100
Later, Master wanted to choose one of us to inherit the Spring Festival Troupe.

396
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,000
I wanted to help him because he's my senior.

397
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,400
But I never thought...

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,500
Senior, drink some tea.

399
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,000
Okay.

400
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,400
It's poisonous.

401
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,900
You want to harm me?

402
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
It's not me. It's Senior Yue.

403
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,900
I hate people the most.

404
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,200
I hate them in front of and behind me.

405
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,900
Since he wants to harm me,

406
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,100
I'll let him know what it means to harm people and harm yourself.

407
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,800
So you'll use your teeth to return the teeth?

408
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
That's right.

409
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,400
I used the same medicine to poison his throat.

410
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Since then, he's been unable to sing.

411
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,800
He can't sing anymore.

412
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Until one day,

413
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Master suddenly asked him to sing again.

414
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,900
He can sing again.

415
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,700
And he can sing better than before.

416
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,300
For so many years, I thought about it for so many times.

417
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,700
But I never thought that he used a singing machine.

418
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,500
He used this first box

419
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,200
to become the hottest friend in Yangzhou.

420
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,400
As long as he's on stage, he'll be able to do nothing.

421
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,200
And I...

422
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
can only sit on the cold bench behind me.

423
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,000
But God has eyes.

424
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He'll die soon after he's red.

425
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
This is a good and evil karma.

426
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
No one can escape it.

427
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,200
No one can escape it.

428
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,000
That wind chimes in the courtyard was made by you?

429
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
That's right.

430
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,200
That year, when Yun Zhe Yue died,

431
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,400
it caused me to dream every night.

432
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,200
Since then, I've been sick.

433
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
My throat isn't as good as before.

434
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I thought that he might be able to stay with me.

435
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
So I bought a new one.

436
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,000
I bought a wind chimes for the courtyard and set up a tent.

437
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,200
I even hung a wind chimes in every room.

438
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,600
But ever since then, every time the thunder and rain start,

439
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,200
the courtyard will sound like a opera.

440
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,000
The people in the opera troupe will be able to see the scene of Yun Zhe Yue's death.

441
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,400
Everyone thought that the wind chimes were making noise.

442
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,200
Later, because of the noise,

443
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,600
the people in the opera troupe left and left.

444
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,200
I had to take the Spring Opera troupe to leave this place.

445
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
The past...

446
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,200
If I could come again,

447
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,600
I surely wouldn't do that.

448
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,200
If what you said is true,

449
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,800
then I'll accept your offer.

450
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Really? You really agreed to let me go?

451
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,800
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir!

452
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Sir, you believe what the class leader said?

453
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,800
The one who's acting is a lunatic. The one who's watching is a fool.

454
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,200
Do you think I can believe that?

455
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
Then why did you agree to let him go?

456
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,000
The Imperial Guards have recorded a lot of bizarre events.

457
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,600
There are many images and sounds that were shown in the Thunderbolt Palace.

458
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
The North and South Formation will also be lost.

459
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
The people who have experienced it are like us.

460
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Before the stimulation of a certain sound,

461
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,600
plus the fact that the eyes can't tell the truth,

462
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
we have almost fallen into the illusion.

463
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,400
Where's the blood?

464
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,200
So this isn't a human-made illusion.

465
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,980
An abandoned

466
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,600
In the capital, don't you know how to analyze?

467
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,200
Why did you come to Yangzhou and your brain and vision have gone down?

468
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
It's because the sky has fallen and someone is standing there.

469
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
You don't need to use your brain anymore, right?

470
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,800
Sir, you're joking. Of course not.

471
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,400
If the sky really falls, I'll have to stand there for you.

472
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Actually, I've seen his hands just now.

473
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,800
He's thin and has a lot of flesh.

474
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Not to mention his roughness. He never even took a needle.

475
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
He even used a needle to kill someone.

476
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,600
How long does he have to practice that martial arts?

477
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,400
How clear are his hands?

478
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,400
But you don't have to kill someone yourself, right?

479
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200
Since you can all deduce it to this extent,

480
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
then you can split up and investigate.

481
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
You can go ask the leader's testimony.

482
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
See if you can find any new clues.

483
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Yes.

484
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,000
You know how to use a needle to hurt people.

485
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You, go investigate who in Yangzhou is good at using this thing.

486
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,800
Investigate some suspicious people.

487
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,200
Yes.

488
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,400
Say it again.

489
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm going to the capital to be my wife.

490
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,800
Little rabbit, you're going to piss me off.

491
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,200
Have you forgotten about your marriage with Xie'er?

492
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,200
You ignored the marriage I arranged for you.

493
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,800
Now, you're actually going to marry Jinxia.

494
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,200
You think I'm a father?

495
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,600
You're dead, right?

496
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,400
Father, I know that marriage is a matter of life and death.

497
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
But you want me to marry Senior Sister.

498
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
I really can't do it.

499
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
What can't you do?

500
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,600
Isn't your relationship always very good?

501
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm not saying that you're not good.

502
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm saying that you're always very good.

503
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
The entire Wu'an Gang is Xie'er.

504
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
What's wrong with her?

505
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Why can't she be the leader's wife?

506
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,600
Let me tell you.

507
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,800
You two are a perfect match.

508
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Only when you marry her, will you have a happy ending.

509
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,000
Who said that a perfect match will have a happy ending?

510
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
And I'm doing pretty well right now.

511
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Anyway, I only agree to marry Yuan Jinxia.

512
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
No matter how you object, I still want to marry her.

513
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Father, I'm not doing this to get your approval.

514
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
I've already made my decision.

515
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm also planning to give Yuan Jinxia a gift.

516
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
You!

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
Just fight.

518
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
After you're done fighting, just let me marry Jinxia home.

519
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,200
Marriage is a big matter.

520
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,400
It's not a child's play.

521
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,200
Are you worthy of Xie'er?

522
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I'll give all the help to Senior Sister.

523
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,000
I'll take Yuan Jinxia away from the Wu'an Gang.

524
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Moreover, I've already found someone I want to be with for the rest of my life.

525
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Senior Sister will only bless me from the bottom of her heart.

526
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,200
She is the person who understands me the most in this world.

527
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
She won't mind what others say.

528
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,600
For the sake of the Wu'an Gang, Xie'er has given too much.

529
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,800
She is the only child I have decided.

530
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,000
No matter what you say, I will never agree.

531
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,800
If you want to marry her, you must marry her!

532
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Father, you're harming me and Senior Sister.

533
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,000
You want to tie Senior Sister up in the Wu'an Gang with a marriage marriage?

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm not only your son, I'm also a man.

535
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I, Xie Xiao, will never change my promise.

536
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,600
Father, I'm telling you today,

537
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,600
no matter if you agree or not, your daughter-in-law can only be Jinxia.

538
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,400
Get out. Get out.

539
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,800
Get out!

540
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
Xiao Yue!

541
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
Father, you're health is bad.

542
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,800
Don't be mad at your health.

543
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,900
I already don't love your son anymore.

544
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,040
You can't escape!

545
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,760
My Lord!

546
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,320
My Lord! Don't scare me!

547
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
This is not a human-made puzzle.

548
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,480
The abandoned Wanderer's Garden

549
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,200
didn't cause any trouble.

550
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
I did hear a child singing Dixiang that day.

551
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,160
Who is pretending to be a slave?

552
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,960
Who is that child?

553
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,800
You,

554
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,000
do you remember

555
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,400
we were divided into groups at Gusu Sword?

556
00:28:52,480 --> 00:29:01,000
We were gripped by

557
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I was seriously injured and almost died.

558
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
When you pulled me,

559
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I knew that I would be by your side forever.

560
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Even if you finally disperse me in your dream.

561
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
How many times have I tried to escape from you?

562
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I finally got the result of years.

563
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
In the lonely and lonely bird, I finally fell.

564
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Senior Sister.

565
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What? Is there something?

566
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
There is something I want to ask you.

567
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You must promise me.

568
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What is it?

569
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I want you to go to Guanyi with me and propose to Jinxia.

570
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Jinxia?

571
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Senior Sister and I broke our engagement three years ago.

572
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It was held in Yangzhou.

573
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Jinxia must have heard about it in Yangzhou.

574
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm afraid she might have a problem.

575
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So if you go with me,

576
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
she will know that we are innocent.

577
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We don't have feelings for each other.

578
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We can also stop the rumors.

579
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I know that Senior Sister will definitely help me, right?

580
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So you are not a careless person.

581
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You just haven't found the right person to think about.

582
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Have you really grown up?

583
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If I still don't grow up,

584
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
how can I be a husband and a parent?

585
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Senior Sister, just help me.

586
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
In this world, you are the best to me.

587
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You are like a father to the chief.

588
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Of course. I am his son.

589
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Senior Sister, then it's settled.

590
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Senior Sister.

591
00:32:43,400 --> 00:33:01,860
There's evidence for every trace of the

592
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,980
blame www.

593
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,960
You

594
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:19,560
Hanow

595
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:29,800
Of course

596
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,560
that you are that child?

597
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,300
You are not a kid.

598
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,600
Who taught you to sing this?

599
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Sis, Sis taught me.

600
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,200
Sis, youный kun greets you.

601
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,100
Regretting her?

602
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,900
I untuk a song reading that anyone else sent me a different song.

603
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,960
Why?

604
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,360
Who taught you to sing this song?

605
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,960
Sister.

606
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,360
Sister taught me.

607
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Sister?

608
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,840
Shouldn't it be brother?

609
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,960
Then tell me first.

610
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,880
Who is that sister?

611
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,680
What does she look like?

612
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,560
Where is she?

613
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,480
Don't cry, kid.

614
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,760
Don't cry.

615
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,360
Don't cry.

616
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,520
Don't cry, kid.

617
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,800
Don't cry, kid.

618
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,760
Don't cry, kid.

619
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,960
She is your child.

620
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,000
He is my son.

621
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What are you doing?

622
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,840
Sorry.

623
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
I'm from the government office.

624
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
I want to ask you something.

625
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,240
Who taught you to sing this song?

626
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,120
We usually work outside.

627
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,280
She always runs into this abandoned yard.

628
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,640
I don't know who taught her.

629
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,600
Sir.

630
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080
Are you okay?

631
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Don't cry.

632
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,000
Xiaobao.

633
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I told you.

634
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,760
You are not allowed to play here.

635
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,000
It's not clean here.

636
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,880
Did you hear that?

637
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,280
Sister?

638
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,560
But I never thought that

639
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,680
it was poisonous.

640
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You want to harm me.

641
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Could it be...

642
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,120
This is what I found

643
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,400
in the abandoned yard.

644
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,280
Sir.

645
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
I have an idea.

646
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,520
I don't know if it's right.

647
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,400
But I don't have any evidence.

648
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,680
If the leader didn't lie,

649
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,280
he checked the whole Spring and Autumn Class

650
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,080
and didn't find the singer.

651
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
If it's not because he's hidden,

652
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,600
then we are going in the wrong direction.

653
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,600
We knew there was a singer.

654
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,640
So we set the target on the leader.

655
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,280
Not only because he's a good singer,

656
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,720
but also because he's a man.

657
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,440
But the kid said

658
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,240
the singer was a sister.

659
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,320
I've checked.

660
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,400
There were only three women in the Spring and Autumn Class.

661
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,760
One was a fireman's aunt.

662
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Two were apprentices.

663
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,800
One of them performed in the first performance.

664
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,480
She performed with Yun Zheyue.

665
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,280
The rest

666
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,720
didn't have any clue.

667
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,120
There was no mention of her

668
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,520
in the file.

669
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,520
There was no difference between the people who were related to her.

670
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,680
It's like there's no such person.

671
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,560
A person can make two sounds.

672
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,120
A man and a woman can't change.

673
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,880
It's a trap.

674
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,120
The murderer hid it so well.

675
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,880
It's hard to guess

676
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,880
who's behind this case.

677
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,520
It's easy to catch the murderer.

678
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
But we can't move the person behind it.

679
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,480
Zhou Xianyi is corrupting the officials.

680
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,040
He's dead in prison.

681
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,680
I think we can tell His Majesty

682
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,320
to end this case.

683
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,680
If we can think of a good way

684
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
to let the murderer take the credit,

685
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,680
that would be the best.

686
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,120
Sir, do you know who the murderer is?

687
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,640
Yes.

688
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,560
He used the needle to kill someone?

689
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,240
How long did he practice that?

690
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,560
How clear is the sword in his hand?

691
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
But there's no evidence.

692
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,000
If so,

693
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,920
I think you should perform another show.

694
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
Another show?

695
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,000
The ghost of the ghost

696
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,360
lure the snake out of the cave.

697
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
Maybe she's dead,

698
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,680
but the ghost has no clue to where it is now.

699
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,480
Boxu,

700
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,000
do you think the murderer is the murderer?

701
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,840
There are still things to be checked out.

702
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,200
Everything is in the boxu to be checked today.

703
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,040
This way please.

704
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,520
Minister Lu.

705
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,920
Hai Yan.

706
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,840
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

707
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,320
Minister Wei likes to come to see you.

708
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,840
It's badly injured,

709
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,400
let's see if His Majesty during the next time

710
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,160
can fulfill the same feeling.

711
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,620
Will his적으로

712
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,080
need to treat the Lord

713
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,960
as if his body was my lihtlz?

714
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,340
Sure.

715
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,140
Didn't Lord Lu invite us to come here to watch the show?

716
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,140
Why is this stage so decorated?

717
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,340
Lord Wei, this is a new show that I've been thinking of these days.

718
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,340
That's why, I especially invited you to comment on it.

719
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,740
You must really appreciate it.

720
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,740
Miss Shangguan, eat some green beans.

721
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,340
I just tasted it. It's not bad.

722
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,540
How about you try this blackberry?

723
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,340
It's sour and sweet. Girls will like it.

724
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,940
You...

725
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,940
It fell.

726
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,940
Miss Shangguan, I think you don't look well.

727
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,340
Are you not feeling well?

728
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,140
How did you get so well? What's going on?

729
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,940
I don't know.

730
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,940
Why did Yang Bukui notice me?

731
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,940
I'm fine.

732
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,140
Miss Shangguan, are you still mad at me?

733
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,540
Even if you're busy, you should rest.

734
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,740
Oh, right. Whenever the food doesn't look good,

735
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,340
I'll make him a bowl of soup to replenish his energy.

736
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,140
How about I go back and make you a bowl and send it to the gang?

737
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,140
Yang Bukui has a heart. I'm really fine.

738
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,140
Then... that's good.

739
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,540
Didn't we already calculate that there will be thunder tonight?

740
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,340
Why isn't he letting go? I'm so tired.

741
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,940
I don't know.

742
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,140
Didn't we already calculate that?

743
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,940
Jump. Jump. Run.

744
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,740
May I ask you, Sir Lu, what is this song you're singing?

745
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,940
Why am I getting more and more confused?

746
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,340
Sir Wei, please calm down.

747
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,340
These past days, because of Zhou Xianyi's case,

748
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,340
I really have a headache.

749
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,340
Yesterday, I happened to meet an old Taoist from Mount Mao.

750
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,340
He showed me his family skills.

751
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,540
I'm always so eager to learn.

752
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,140
So, please come and witness it together.

753
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,740
What family skills?

754
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,140
Yin Ghost Summoning Soul.

755
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,940
Yin Ghost Summoning Soul.

756
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
They're coming.

757
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,940
Open the door of heaven and open the door of hell!

758
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Yin Ghost Summoning Soul.

759
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,740
I, the son of the Beast, am here to return your soul.

760
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,780
Green😂

761
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:30,940
BUG

762
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,940

763
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,820
I order...

764
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,660
Who are you?

765
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,380
Coming from Suqing掉es right in Mingyue Lake.

766
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,940
They have fallen apart and gone home.

767
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,220
Yunzhi advisory board.

768
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:57,820
That's right.

769
00:42:59,460 --> 00:42:59,860
Oh dear.

770
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,220
Outside the mountain,

771
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,740
I can't beat the fate.

772
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,140
Close your eyes, I can see your face.

773
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,220
Open your eyes, the north is quiet.

774
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,100
The sword is full of sky.

775
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,860
In the mortal world,

776
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,980
who has conquered

777
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,220
the world is silent,

778
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:26,020
then theivalent

779
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:34,020
I saw your white hair on that day.

780
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,020
We spent our years together.

781
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:44,020
In a blink of an eye, a thousand years have passed.

782
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,020
I'm sorry.

783
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,020
I'm sorry.
