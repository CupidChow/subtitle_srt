Even behind his back,

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,800
there is a stronger master who controls everything.

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Dayang, you know me better.

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Eat.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Aren't you late?

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Why haven't you eaten yet?

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
My mom.

65
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,400
She asked me to go on a blind date.

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Blind... date?

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't laugh.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
I... I don't want to.

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Whose child is so unlucky

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and so lucky?

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Third child of the family.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Third child of the family?

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Why are you laughing?

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
Third child of the family...

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,400
That...

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
This is good news.

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
The Yi family is a family of scholars.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
After you go there,

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
you can save a lot of money.

80
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
You should marry them.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,800
Save money for your brothers.

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,000
Although I don't have money,

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can live a comfortable life.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
The sons of the Yi family

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,600
are always talking about it.

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,400
If I go there,

87
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
they will make me suffer.

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
If you don't want to marry,

89
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
just tell your mom.

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Dayang,

91
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
how about

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I tell my mom

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,200
that I'm yours?

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Mr. Xia,

95
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
you... you are so ungrateful.

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Besides,

97
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
you can't be so unfair to yourself.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Really.

99
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm not.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
I'm not.

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm not.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
Really.

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Dayang,

104
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
you are wrong.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Although you call me grandpa,

106
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,400
I'm still your sister.

107
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
My sister is in trouble.

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I should help her.

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,200
You are right.

110
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
But

111
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I know you.

112
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,000
When you are in trouble,

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you are my sister.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
When you are not,

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
you are my grandpa.

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
How about this?

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You...

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
I'll be your assistant.

119
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
In front of your mom,

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll pretend to be your friend.

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I won't take more from you.

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,400
Ten cents a day.

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
How about it?

124
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Ten cents a day?

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
You are so smart.

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
You are so smart.

127
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Even if you ask me for help,

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I won't agree.

129
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,400
You are the only one who can't take it.

130
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
Who can?

131
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Ten cents is more.

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
You can't buy food and goods

133
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
or buy anything.

134
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
You can't buy anything.

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Well...

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,200
Yang Yue, Six Gate.

137
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Yuan Jin Xia, Six Gate.

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Greetings, Lord Lu.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Greetings, Lord.

140
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Where is Yang Bo?

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
My dad is not feeling well.

142
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
He is resting in the warehouse.

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Please come with me.

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Yuan Jin Xia,

145
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,800
you are the Six Gate's assistant.

146
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Why did you

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
take the cup for Lu?

148
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Why did you write it so smoothly?

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Old Master Xiao Ke.

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Go remind Huang Yu

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to send the contract

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to the Governor of Jiliao

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
before he is appointed.

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Send me the picture

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
of Qingming that you promised me.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm a little impatient.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, I'll call someone to urge him.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Tell him

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that I have a way

160
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to make him

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to be promoted.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I have a way.

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, you are so fond of him.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I will definitely

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
transfer your words

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to Huang Yu's ears.

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let him send the picture

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
to you in the shortest time.

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Drink.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you, Old Master Xiao Ke.

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Father.

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Lord Lu.

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm a disabled person.

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Please forgive me for being rude.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You are welcome.

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Lord Lu, please.

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Lord Lu, please sit.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You two go out.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Elder.

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Lord Lu, please wait.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Father.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you okay?

183
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Before it gets dark,

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I want you to do

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
what you can do

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to the people on this ship

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and the people on the ship.

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Master.

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Father.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Please take care of it.

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Go.

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Please excuse me.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Lord Lu.

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My son is a mischievous boy.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Please forgive me.

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Elder.

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Please sit.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you, Lord.

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You are still listening.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
My father once mentioned

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that in the Imperial Guards,

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
no one could keep track of you.

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It was a good thing.

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now, there are people

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
who can keep track of you.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Is your father okay?

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He is still an old man.

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He is always talking.

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I tried to persuade him many times,

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
but he never listens.

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your father is a man of backbone.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How could he be easily convinced?

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Every time my father is free,

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
he will remember

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
many things that happened before.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He has been hoping that

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
you could go back and help him.

220
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I will be your healer.

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I will never forget it.

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But I'm afraid that

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't repay you in this life.

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I am old and disabled now.

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have lost my talent.

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I can only spend my time in the government office.

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I have no other ideas.

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Elder.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is not urgent.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You don't have to make such a hasty decision.

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This trip to Yangzhou

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
will depend on your guidance.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You are welcome, sir.

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't dare to.

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
By the way,

236
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
my father asked me to say something to you.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The deceased...

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Elder.

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I won't disturb you.

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I will leave now.

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Take care, sir.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I...

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My father asked me to say something to you.

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The deceased...

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Master was a guard in the past.

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He was under the command of Lu.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You don't know about it, do you?

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know why.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I never heard my father mention it.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I heard from Lu that

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the commandant expected master to go back to the guards.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It seems that he is very loyal to master.

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why did he leave back then?

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Find a chance to test him.

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Father is always cautious.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Do you think he can say it?

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't think so.

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So, the people of the six gates

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
like to eavesdrop on other people's strengths.

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Master Lu.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Lord Yang said you were naughty.

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It seems that you are not.

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you think he will tell father

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
about us eavesdropping on them?

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Although he is annoying,

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
he won't tell others about it.

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Does Lu know

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
why master left back then?

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think so.

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's go to pay our respects to master Lu.

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You know that there are tigers in the mountains.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why do you want to go to the mountains?

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't want to be a tiger.

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I want to be a tiger's son.

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you don't like his position, I will go.

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I...

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Something is going to happen.

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Master.

279
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Master Lu.

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Master Lu.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He turned around and said something.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Master, are you okay?

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You are not caught by me, are you?

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Besides playing hunting,

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know if Lord Yang knows

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that you are a root bug and a trouble maker.

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What do you think?

288
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Master.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Although I eavesdropped on you,

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
it's not good.

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I just heard that

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Lu's commandant

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
wanted him to go back to the guard

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
because he values master's talent.

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But master didn't agree.

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I also think

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
it's a shame that master stays in the Six Forts.

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a pity.

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If the guard really needs master,

300
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I will go to sleep.

301
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You want to be a monster?

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm a monster.

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't see master's talent.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If you don't,

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
you can go to sleep.

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why are you looking for me?

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well...

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Of course I have to look for you.

309
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You have to tell me

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
how master left the guard.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then I can find a way to persuade master.

312
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You can ask your master directly.

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, no, no.

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Master, you don't know.

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
According to master's personality,

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
he doesn't tell me.

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Maybe he will punish me to go to Yangzhou.

318
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's so miserable.

319
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So?

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What does it have to do with me?

321
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes, it does.

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Master Lu.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
To be honest,

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I have a problem

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
besides helping master.

326
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Once this curiosity is stimulated,

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
if I don't understand what's going on,

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
it's all wrong.

329
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I am at least

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
a little assistant to master.

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What if I'm not at ease

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and affect master's investigation?

333
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's not good, right?

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Be careful.

335
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Curiosity

336
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
will kill you.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Master,

338
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
if you don't tell me,

339
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I really can't help you.

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Master,

341
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
it's okay if you don't want to tell me now.

342
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll wait for you to tell me.

343
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll wait for you to tell me.

344
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll wait for you to tell me.

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's okay.

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll wait for you to feel good.

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Besides,

348
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
if you have any orders,

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
just tell me.

350
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll wait here.

351
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Just call me when you need me.

352
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Be careful.

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Curiosity will kill you.

354
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not a little wild cat.

355
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm a wild cat.

356
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Master,

357
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Master Liao Wenhua is here.

358
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Father,

359
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I know you like jade.

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I made you

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
a different jade today.

362
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Father,

363
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
look at it.

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is it as beautiful as a rose?

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When you send things,

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
you'll be able to see the beauty.

367
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm not a little wild cat.

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm a little wild cat.

369
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What's the matter?

370
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Father,

371
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
look at what you said.

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That...

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There is something.

374
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Father, you know that

375
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
my son was born in the southeast.

376
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He has been worried about the people of his hometown

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and has been trapped in the desert for years.

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He always thinks about

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
doing something for the people of his hometown.

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I heard that

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the imperial jade has been transferred to the capital of Jiliao.

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Then he has been in a lack of

383
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the capital of the southeast.

384
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I wonder if you have a choice.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm thinking about it.

386
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Father,

387
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I've already made up my mind

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to support you

389
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
with these little wishes.

390
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Thank you for your help.

391
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm so hungry.

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm so hungry.

393
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Wait!

394
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Brother,

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm so hungry.

396
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't have time to prepare food.

397
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Can you give me this food?

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can go and prepare another one.

399
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Thank you.

400
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Sir,

401
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I've prepared some snacks for you.

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And tea.

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Would you like to eat some and drink some?

404
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you need it,

405
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can send it to you.

406
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're really not hungry?

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The cake smells good.

408
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Sir,

409
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
would you like some tea?

410
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It smells so good.

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Would you like some tea?

412
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sir,

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
wait.

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What's going on?

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He took my tea.

416
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't know if I should agree or not.

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is there any other way to please him?

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Sir,

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
have you had lunch?

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
How about I give you a basin of water

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and wipe your face?

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's okay if you don't want to wipe your face.

423
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
How about I give you some water

424
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
to warm your feet?

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The moisture in the boat is very strong.

426
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's good for your body.

427
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Or you want to eat some melon seeds?

428
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'll prepare some for you.

429
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you thinking?

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Sir, say something!

431
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What can I do for you?

432
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's a cockroach in the room.

433
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Help me catch it.

434
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes.

435
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Sir, you go to the wind chimes first.

436
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
When I've cleaned up the cockroach,

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll go to invite you.

438
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Cockroach.

439
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Get down.

440
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Sir.

441
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Do you know your mistake?

442
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't know what I did.

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You went against the rules

444
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and disrespected your teacher.

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're just a little

446
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
six-door carpenter.

447
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How dare you ask

448
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
about my past to the Lu Jinli?

449
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're not well-behaved.

450
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

453
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I was too considerate.

454
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But Lu Yi...

455
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
How dare you!

456
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You can't call the name of Lu Jinli

457
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
as you like.

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It seems that I've been too impolite to you.

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's why you're so ungrateful.

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Tonight, you'll kneel here

461
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and reflect on yourself.

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Dad,

463
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I've been making Jin Xia kneel here.

464
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's not appropriate.

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's the only way

466
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
she'll know what she did wrong.

467
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Or else she'll make a bigger mistake.

468
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Dad,

469
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
the boat is wet because of cold.

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If Jin Xia kneels here for a night,

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
she'll be ill.

472
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Dad,

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm also wrong

474
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
for not taking good care of Jin Xia.

475
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you want to punish me,

476
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
punish me.

477
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Then write a letter of repentance.

478
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Give it to me tomorrow morning.

479
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Sir.

480
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Thank you, dad.

481
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't say it.

482
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Come on.

483
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Get up.

484
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Does it hurt?

485
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's numb.

486
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Be careful.

487
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's numb.

488
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's numb.

489
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's numb.

490
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Be careful.

491
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's numb.

492
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This Lu Yi is so despicable.

493
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
One day,

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll step on him

495
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and vent my anger.

496
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Keep your voice down.

497
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Are you satisfied?

498
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The Imperial Guards

499
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
are known to be ruthless.

500
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If you were to do something like this,

501
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
you'd be dead by now.

502
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think you're

503
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
reasonable.

504
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Dang Yang,

505
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
who are you?

506
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm your man.

507
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If I hadn't just pleaded for you,

508
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
you'd still be kneeling there.

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'd rather kneel there

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
than write a letter of repentance.

511
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I knew it.

512
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Writing is the biggest punishment for you.

513
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I can fight and quarrel with you.

514
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If you want me to write

515
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
those old-fashioned letters,

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'd rather kill myself.

517
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Fine.

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I've thought it over for you.

519
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Wait.

520
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You knew I'd be punished?

521
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Here.

522
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'll read it.

523
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You write it.

524
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm just writing.

525
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Prince.

526
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't forget you.

527
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Sir!

528
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You're so stubborn.

529
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You even found a way to get me.

530
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You even found a way to get me.

531
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Give me some money.

532
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't forget you.

533
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No, no, no.

534
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't forget you.

535
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What are you writing?

536
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What am I writing?

537
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Prince, I don't forget you.

538
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Do it again.

539
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Prince.

540
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't forget you.

541
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There's an cockroach in the room.

542
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Help me find it.

543
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Cockroach.

544
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Why isn't there any?

545
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
No.

546
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No.

547
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's so dark here.

548
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
There's no ink.

549
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I can't see any book or ink.

550
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think the cockroach must have been stolen.

551
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's clearly a trap.

552
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No, no.

553
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Why did you write it wrong again?

554
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What are you writing?

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Tell me.

556
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He treats me as a servant for a day.

557
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's fine.

558
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
He doesn't tell me why my master left the Imperial Guards.

559
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
He even said bad things about me in front of my master.

560
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
He asked me to wear shoes and write something like this.

561
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You're a bad person.

562
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You're a bad person.

563
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I won't call you Yuan Jinxia.

564
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Please be quiet.

565
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Sanfu.

566
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Sir.

567
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Get rid of them.

568
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're bothering me.

569
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Wait and see.

570
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Wait.

572
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Wipe this table for me.

573
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yes.

574
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yuan Jinxia.

575
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Who is it?

576
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You two, go after them.

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes.

578
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yes.

579
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hurry up and report to the Lord.

580
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yes.

581
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You two, go over there.

582
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

583
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You go over there.

584
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes.

585
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm worried that we won't be able to find him.

586
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's weird.

587
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Why isn't there anyone?

588
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm worried about you.

589
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're the one who's worried about me.

590
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You're the one who's worried about me.

591
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You're the one who's worried about me.

592
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Why are you here?

593
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Let's go.

594
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Wait.

595
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What do you want?

596
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
General's birthday cake is missing.

597
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And the whole ship is full of you guys.

598
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I suspect that the birthday cake was stolen.

599
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's related to you.

600
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Do you have any evidence?

601
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Not yet.

602
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You don't have any evidence to say anything?

603
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Why are you here?

604
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Because of my intuition.

605
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Search.

606
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yes.

607
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Wait.

608
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
On the ship,

609
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
everyone is a member of the palace.

610
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Let's have a talk.

611
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'll tell you later.

612
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You two, go after them.

613
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes.

614
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Let's have a talk.

615
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's not good to hurt He Qi.

616
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I've heard that the Central Guards of Zheng State are on the right side.

617
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
General Yu Yang Mo is on the border.

618
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He killed five Mongolians.

619
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And he dared to attack.

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
No wonder the old saying goes,

621
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
a bear is a bear.

622
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A bear is a bear.

623
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
How can you mention the Central Guards of Zheng State?

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Arrest him.

625
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes.

626
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll cut you.

627
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Your Highness, let's go.

628
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Go after them.

629
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes.

630
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Lord.

631
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This girl won't let us search the house.

632
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
She not only insulted the general,

633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
but also dared to fight with us.

634
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
She hurt two guards.

635
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
She's not a girl.

636
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
She's a girl.

637
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
She's a girl.

638
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
She hurt two guards.

639
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I suspect Sheng Cheng Gang.

640
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
They stole her.

641
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Joke.

642
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You said I stole her.

643
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I said you're a thug.

644
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Arrest them.

645
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yes.

646
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Go.

647
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Jin Sha.

648
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Arrest them.

649
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yes.

650
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Stop.

651
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Who are you?

652
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You dare to attack the court officer?

653
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Court officer?

654
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I've got a lot of blood

655
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
from court officers.

656
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You...

657
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Who are you?

658
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Who are you?

659
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Jin Yi Wei's guard, Lu Yi.

660
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
This...

661
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Jin Yi Wei's commander is Lu Ting's son?

662
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Lu Ting's son?

663
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
He's not useless at all.

664
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
He can scare people, right?

665
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Hurry.

666
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Take the knife away.

667
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'll take it.

668
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Manager Lu.

669
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They didn't listen to the search.

670
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
They even hurt my guards.

671
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I just want to catch the thief.

672
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm not suspicious.

673
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't tell me the truth.

674
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You came to search my room without any reason.

675
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Don't play tricks on me.

676
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You're not as good as them.

677
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Sheng Cheng Gang has a lot of people.

678
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
His warehouse is so small.

679
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
How can he hide?

680
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You should ask him.

681
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Why did you say

682
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I stole your Sheng Cheng Gang?

683
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Before the ship was launched,

684
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
you two were so sneaky.

685
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Be careful.

686
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes.

687
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You saw Sheng Cheng Gang's eyes.

688
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It wasn't you who stole it.

689
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It was someone else.

690
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You're kidding.

691
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't even know

692
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
what's in your box.

693
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's just your lie.

694
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Who can believe it?

695
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You...

696
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Without solid evidence,

697
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
how can you frame us?

698
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You're right.

699
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So, Wang Can Jiang

700
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
is so guilty.

701
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
My subordinate is not sensible.

702
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
He will discipline me in the future.

703
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Can you let him go?

704
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Can Jiang.

705
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Wang Can Jiang.

706
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You may not know me well.

707
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm a weird person.

708
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
As long as he's mine,

709
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I can beat him

710
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
or kill him.

711
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Mine?

712
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But if others

713
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
dare to touch him,

714
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm afraid it's hard

715
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
to control my temper.

716
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Misunderstanding.

717
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Misunderstanding.

718
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm not good at managing things.

719
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm reckless.

720
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
If you're worried about me,

721
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
please forgive me.

722
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
When did you lose Sheng Cheng Gang?

723
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
After silver-stone II.

724
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
When silver-stone II was changed to silver-stone II,

725
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the boxes were still there.

726
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Take me to the crime scene.

727
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
This way, please.

728
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Sir, you're...

729
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Go with me.

730
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Dayang,

731
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
about Sheng Cheng Gang's disappearance,

732
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
you tell master.

733
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'll go with Mr. Lu.

734
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay.

735
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Sir, please.

736
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
No life-saving effect.

737
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Just a short coma.

738
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
What did they eat

739
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
during the battle?

740
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
All the food on the ship

741
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
was the same.

742
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
They changed the fishing rod after dinner.

743
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
They didn't eat anything else.

744
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
How many boxes

745
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
of Sheng Cheng Gang?

746
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Eight boxes.

747
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Eight for long,

748
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
six for wide,

749
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and two for tall.

750
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
How did you know?

751
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I saw it when I got on the ship.

752
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Even if I didn't see it,

753
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I can guess with the most basic trace.

754
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You're covered with so much oil.

755
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I don't know if I can guess it.

756
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What's wrong with the oil?

757
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm afraid that

758
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
it's not good for your health.

759
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's not good for your health.

760
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's not good for your health.

761
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm afraid that

762
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
these calligraphy works

763
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
are being used by the ship.

764
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So,

765
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I suggest that

766
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
my chess player

767
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
use wax

768
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
to cut the calligraphy out of beeswax.

769
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Because those calligraphy works

770
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
are very expensive.

771
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's not good for your health.

772
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I can't tell.

773
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You're so meticulous.

774
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
This...

775
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's so slippery.

776
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Sir,

777
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
please go to gather all the guards

778
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
to check the situation.

779
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
This...

780
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Guards.

781
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Take them back to the ship.

782
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yes.

783
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Sir,

784
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I can tell you

785
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
my theory.

786
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
First,

787
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
from these scratches,

788
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
the movement of the box

789
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
must be very big.

790
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's so big that

791
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
it means that

792
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
the thieves are not afraid of anything.

793
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
How can you be sure

794
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
that these scratches

795
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
are made by the thieves

796
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and not by the guards?

797
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
The direction is different.

798
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The scratches are different.

799
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Take a look.

800
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Second,

801
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
these guards are very stable.

802
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
There are no traces of any movement.

803
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And I just saw

804
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
these...

805
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
The footprints are

806
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
the footprints of the guards.

807
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No one has ever

808
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
entered or left the room.

809
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This means that

810
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
the thieves who stole the birthstone

811
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
are very familiar with the guards.

812
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Otherwise,

813
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
they wouldn't be

814
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
put in the door

815
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
without any protection.

816
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Do you think

817
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
it's Wang Fangxing

818
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
who wants to

819
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
steal the birthstone?

820
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The thieves are calling for the thieves.

821
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Sir,

822
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Mr. Huang personally

823
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
sent you

824
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the picture of Qingming.

825
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Sir,

826
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
please have a look.

827
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Thank you.

828
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's really

829
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
a piece of cake.

830
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Good.

831
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Mr. Huang,

832
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
you did a good job.

833
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Mr. Xiao Ge,

834
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
everyone knows

835
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
that you got this picture.

836
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Everyone

837
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
wants to come

838
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and see it.

839
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's right.

840
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's better to see

841
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
the good things than the bad.

842
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Let's enjoy it together.

843
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

844
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Manager Lu,

845
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
my guards are here.

846
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Let me do it.

847
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The guards of the State of Zheng

848
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
all look like they are the spies.

849
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
In fact, they are all fake.

850
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Their feet are not fake.

851
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Their bodies are made of fertilizer.

852
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Wait.

853
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Brother, you did a good job.

854
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Thank you.

855
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You are welcome.

856
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It seems that the storm is coming.

857
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Master.

858
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Are you okay?

859
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm fine.

860
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Hurry up.

861
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Go to have a meal.

862
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You guys,

863
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
follow me.

864
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yes.

865
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Take master back to his room.

866
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Hurry up.

867
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Go.

868
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Dad, be careful.

869
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Master, be careful.

870
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Call the food down.

871
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yes.

872
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Hurry up.

873
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Call the food down.

874
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yes.

875
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Hurry up.

876
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Hurry up.

877
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Call the food down.

878
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yes.

879
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Hurry up.

880
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Call the food down.

881
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Guards,

882
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
turn off the fire.

883
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Hurry up.

884
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This way.

885
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yes.

886
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
This way.

887
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Ghosts.

888
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Ghost.

889
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Ghost.

890
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Ghost boat.

891
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Ghost boat.

892
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Ghost boat.

893
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The ghost boat is coming.

894
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Hurry up.

895
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Ghost boat.

896
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,280
The ghost ship!

897
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,560
The ghost ship!

898
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,400
The ghost ship!

899
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,600
The ghost ship!

900
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,480
The ghost ship!

901
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,400
The ghost ship!

902
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,600
The ghost ship!

903
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
The ghost ship is here!

904
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,400
The ghost ship is here!

905
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,160
My lord, the ghost ship is here!

906
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,160
What ghost ship?

907
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,880
My lord, 700 years ago,

908
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,040
this water is the border of the backland of the Houlang.

909
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,720
Zhu Yougui was assassinated by his subordinate Feng Ting'e.

910
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,240
Zhu Yougui's immortal anger

911
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,600
was destroyed in this water.

912
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,080
It will appear once every few years.

913
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,520
Every ship he meets

914
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,720
will be cursed.

915
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,960
I heard that the ghost ship appeared last time.

916
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,360
The blood was all over the water.

917
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,080
My lord, let's turn back quickly.

918
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Otherwise, we can't run away.

919
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,600
My lord.

920
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,960
My lord!

921
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,480
My lord!

922
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,880
The ghost ship will devour the living

923
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,480
and poison the ghost ship!

924
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,840
My lord, be careful!

925
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,960
My lord!

926
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,440
My lord!

927
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,160
Sanfu.

928
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,880
My lord.

929
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,920
Put the ship down first.

930
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,880
Fix the ship's body.

931
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,400
Yes.

932
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,120
The ghost is gone.

933
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,600
Hurry up!

934
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
Bring the rope on the ground here!

935
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,920
Go help him!

936
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,480
Hurry up!

937
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,760
Put the hat down!

938
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,480
Yes!

939
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,520
Hurry up!

940
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,480
Be careful!

941
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,280
What's going on?

942
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
I suddenly turned myself.

943
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,320
We can't even control the river.

944
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,320
The ship seems to have seen a ghost.

945
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,760
The ghost ship is attacking us.

946
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,120
Everyone, pull the rope!

947
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,960
My lord.

948
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,920
My lord.

949
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,880
My lord.

950
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,840
My lord.

951
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,640
My lord.

952
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,080
What should we do now?

953
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,880
We should go to the ghost ship.

954
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,480
Ghost ship?

955
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,680
I'll go with you!

956
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,480
I'll go with you!

957
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,120
Stop, my lord!

958
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,880
My lord, what are you doing?

959
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,200
You really want to go there?

960
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,400
My lord.

961
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,760
