Uncle.

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,640
Listen.

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,840
It's a matter of life and death.

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm just a good grandson.

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
You can do it or not.

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,920
Uncle.

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,280
Be good.

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,960
No.

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,160
Uncle, don't go.

68
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,320
No, uncle.

69
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,240
You...

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,240
Why am I doing this?

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,120
My lord,

72
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,600
drink the medicine.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,680
It's not easy to get the medicine.

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
You'll be fine after drinking it.

75
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
My lord, open your mouth.

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,200
My lord.

77
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,040
What should I do?

78
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,440
What should I do?

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,160
My lord, you should drink the medicine.

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,840
My lord.

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,520
My lord.

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,440
Take this to him.

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,240
Make sure he drinks it all.

84
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,720
Don't waste time.

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,040
My lord.

86
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,200
My lord.

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,160
Isn't it just for the medicine?

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,920
It's just for the meat.

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,760
My lord, life is more important.

90
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,880
5 days ago

91
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,200
The 88 days seemed like quite a lot,

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,800
but I did more.

93
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,360
5 days.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,800
That's great.

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,660
Beautiful.

96
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,780
I'll draw you the Jestra warped sword at the Hotel.

97
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,660
Good.

98
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,900
You tried to find the struggle,

99
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,980
but failed.

100
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:34,000
So that can be daran

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,280
It hurts.

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,760
It hurts.

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I almost fed you, but you still bit me.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,120
You're so cold.

105
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,960
It hurts so much, my little girl.

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
But it's good that you can take the medicine.

107
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,360
7 weeks ago

108
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
Why does Jin Xia's poison

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,820
I saw that the poison tirk was weakening.

110
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,940
It's gonna be convulsions soon.

111
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,360
If this continues,

112
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,340
it's just a diversionary action.

113
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,260
That Jin Xia

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,160
will lose for sure.

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,320
Wait a minute.

116
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,080
I think Dr. Ling's medicine

117
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
can't ещеng the poison.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,280
This is Desolation Poison.

119
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,200
It's very nóiable.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,920
I wouldn't die here

121
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,080
Hold on. Hold on.

122
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,560
Miss Yuan.

123
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,040
You're here.

124
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,920
Sister Shangguan.

125
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,000
I brought you some food.

126
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,120
Thank you.

127
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,200
What's wrong?

128
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you not feeling well?

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,640
No.

130
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
Maybe I have a cold.

131
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,400
Sit down. Sit down.

132
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,560
What's wrong with your mouth?

133
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
I'm fine.

134
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,040
I haven't eaten meat for days.

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,960
I want to eat meat, so I bit myself.

136
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,160
Why are you doing this?

137
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,760
Where's Dayang?

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,040
She's cooking soup for you in the back of the room.

139
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
She made this, too.

140
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
Dayang knows me well.

141
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,360
She knows what I want.

142
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
You're so close.

143
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
I envy you.

144
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes.

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,160
We've been brothers since we were kids.

146
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,600
Of course.

147
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,760
Have you ever thought about being together?

148
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,400
No.

149
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I wouldn't.

150
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
It's impossible.

151
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm like this.

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
I'm like a brother to her.

153
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,360
As a woman,

154
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,320
I can't stand her.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
I won't say it.

156
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,440
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,480
I'll go check on Xie Xiao.

163
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,720
He said he'd make you medicine.

164
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,440
Enjoy your meal.

165
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
Thank you, sister.

166
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,520
Don't die before you meet your end.

168
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,960
Goodbye.

169
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Hang in there.

170
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,960
Hang in there.

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,800
Kid.

172
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,000
You're awake.

173
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,160
Senior.

174
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,880
Don't talk.

175
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,960
Have a good rest.

176
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,720
Sir.

177
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,920
Sir, you're awake.

178
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,400
Girl.

179
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,320
Are you tired?

180
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,760
She should be fine now.

181
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,480
Uncle.

182
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,560
Sir is awake.

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,640
Doctor Ling said

184
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,320
if sir wakes up,

185
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,640
he'll break through the Ghost Gate.

186
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
You're lucky.

187
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,360
You still have a long life.

188
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,640
Okay.

189
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Not like me.

190
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,640
Not like you?

191
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,000
I mean not like me.

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm a little sick.

193
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,160
Maybe one day

194
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,080
I'll be promoted

195
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,520
after I work.

196
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,000
You girl.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,160
Uncle.

198
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,920
You can't curse yourself.

199
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,960
You were not like this before.

200
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,480
Look at your face.

201
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
What's wrong with my face?

202
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
It's whiter than a ghost.

203
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,640
I won't talk.

204
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,360
You didn't sleep well last night.

205
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
You must be tired.

206
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,880
Hurry up.

207
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,720
Go back.

208
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,640
I'll take care of her.

209
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm fine.

210
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
I'm really fine.

211
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,520
I'll stay here.

212
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,960
Come on.

213
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,600
Have a bowl of porridge.

214
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

215
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,960
Uncle.

216
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,040
More soup.

217
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,960
Okay.

218
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,800
You're so tired.

219
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
You're right.

220
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,520
Come on.

221
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,200
Sir.

222
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,240
Are you hungry?

223
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,040
Have some porridge.

224
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,040
What's wrong with your mouth?

225
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,760
This?

226
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Yesterday,

227
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,880
when I was going to drink water,

228
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,960
I accidentally

229
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,840
hit a big stone.

230
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,000
It's easy to cough here.

231
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,280
You're funny.

232
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,920
Funny.

233
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,480
It's funny.

234
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
It's not because of you.

235
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
Uncle.

236
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,440
What are you talking about?

237
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
Nothing.

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,120
I heard it.

239
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,160
Come on.

240
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,840
Have some porridge.

241
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
What did you hear?

242
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,800
I heard that I fell.

243
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,160
Come on.

244
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,240
Have some porridge.

245
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
Drink it when it gets cold.

246
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,520
Uncle.

247
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,480
Hurry up.

248
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Here.

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
It's good that you're awake.

250
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,120
There are pickles here.

251
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,720
Uncle.

252
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,040
Don't take too much.

253
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,080
I want some light food.

254
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,240
Okay.

255
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,920
Light food.

256
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,680
Okay.

257
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,640
Okay.

258
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,160
Ling.

259
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,000
Dr. Ling.

260
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,800
You're much better.

261
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Have a look.

262
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,120
How is it?

263
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,480
It's much better.

264
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,200
I can eat now.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,520
It seems that this detoxification prescription

266
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,920
has a good effect.

267
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,800
Really?

268
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,960
Then I'll take it.

269
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,760
Okay.

270
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Thank you.

271
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,360
Thank you.

272
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,280
Thank you.

273
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,040
Thank you.

274
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,800
Thank you.

275
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,600
Thank you.

276
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,480
Really?

277
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,240
Then you're safe now.

278
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,600
It seems that

279
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,120
I've got my life back.

280
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,280
Great.

281
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,840
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

282
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,960
I'll remember your kindness forever.

283
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
She's saved.

284
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
You don't have to flatter me.

285
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,760
Now that she's awake,

286
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,960
she can walk around the room.

287
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,040
But there are many poisonous snakes nearby.

288
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,520
You'd better not go anywhere.

289
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I know.

290
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
Uncle.

291
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,320
Dr. Ling is a great doctor.

292
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,400
I didn't lie to you, right?

293
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,160
You have to listen to me in the future.

294
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,360
But when you take care of her,

295
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,120
you should take care of yourself.

296
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
Don't worry.

297
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,120
I'll take care of myself.

298
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,200
Uncle.

299
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,280
You should go back and have a rest.

300
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,600
Of course I can take care of her.

301
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,400
Stop talking nonsense.

302
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,160
You go back and have a rest.

303
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,680
I'll take care of her.

304
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,560
You go.

305
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,400
Go back.

306
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,040
My child.

307
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,720
Dr. Ling is looking for you.

308
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,480
Me?

309
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,440
It's great that you're awake.

310
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,600
As you said,

311
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm not short-lived.

312
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,880
It's cruel, right?

313
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,440
It's too cruel.

314
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,400
You beg me to forgive.

315
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,080
Please give up your life.

316
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,680
I need it.

317
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
It's a great defeat.

318
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
I'm even afraid to talk about it with you.

319
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,080
Goodbye, master.

320
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Where is the minister?

321
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
He is on duty today.

322
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Yuanfang,

323
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
I haven't been here for a while.

324
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Did anything new happen?

325
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
The governor is in need of this.

326
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,160
His Majesty has appointed a man to supervise the investigation.

327
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Isn't he going to be the minister of the Ministry of War,

328
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
supervising the investigation,

329
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
and supervising the imperial censorate?

330
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
This matter was recommended by Liao Wenhua.

331
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I heard that Liao Wenhua didn't ask for your opinion beforehand.

332
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Really?

333
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
It seems that Zhou Xianyi's case

334
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,160
is not enough to warn Liao Wenhua.

335
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Is there anything else?

336
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
The Ministry of Revenue has been having difficulties

337
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
with the implementation of the Yanzheng contract in Changlu,

338
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
so they asked me to send a minister

339
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
to implement the Yanzheng contract.

340
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Who are you going to send?

341
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm waiting for you to come back and discuss it.

342
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Okay.

343
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Before I went to Yangzhou,

344
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I asked you to display the Qingming and Shanghe pictures

345
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
and hang them on the hall.

346
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Why didn't you do it?

347
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
I did it.

348
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
But after the picture was shown,

349
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
the central watchman said that there was a problem with the picture.

350
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
He wanted to talk to you.

351
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
A problem?

352
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Yes. That's what the central watchman said.

353
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Okay.

354
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
When I'm done with my work,

355
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
find someone for me.

356
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes, sir.

357
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Dayang,

358
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
what's your case?

359
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I... I saw that the chief of Shangguan

360
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
didn't eat much in the morning.

361
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
So I prepared some snacks

362
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
and sent them to him.

363
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
You're so loyal.

364
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
You used to be the chef of my master.

365
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Now that sister Shangguan appears,

366
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
I'm the only brother who can resist the war.

367
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
No.

368
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
I didn't forget you.

369
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,160
I made you some snacks yesterday.

370
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Can I eat this?

371
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Yes.

372
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
How's Mr. Lu?

373
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
He's awake.

374
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
He drank all the porridge he made.

375
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
He has a good appetite.

376
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
It seems that his condition has improved.

377
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Yes.

378
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Dr. Ling's medical skills are really amazing.

379
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
It's a pity that he always hides in the old forest

380
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
and hides talents.

381
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Yes.

382
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
By the way,

383
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
I made porridge for you in the kitchen.

384
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I think you don't look very good.

385
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I put red dates in it.

386
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
I think you're not very good.

387
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm sorry.

388
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
I'm not very good.

389
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I put red dates in it.

390
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
And some medicine to replenish qi.

391
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Drink it.

392
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
What's wrong?

393
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
What's wrong with your face?

394
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Who bullied you?

395
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Dayang.

396
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
You're so nice to me.

397
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm touched.

398
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Don't be touched.

399
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Drink the porridge.

400
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
It's time to cool down.

401
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I'm busy giving snacks to Miss Shangguan.

402
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
I won't talk to you anymore.

403
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Everyone has different ability to bear.

404
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
If there's really a problem,

405
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I can only say it's an effort.

406
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
But I can't guarantee that

407
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
he's not a life-threatening person.

408
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Jinxia.

409
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Dr. Ling.

410
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Don't talk.

411
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
You'll get hurt.

412
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
When are you going to tell him?

413
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
I won't tell him.

414
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Please help me to keep my secret.

415
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
It'll be fine after I'm done with the poison.

416
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Right?

417
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
I'm sorry.

418
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I'm sorry.

419
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm sorry.

420
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
I'm afraid it's not that simple now.

421
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
What do you mean by that?

422
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Your clothes are dirty.

423
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
It's okay.

424
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
I'll just wash it.

425
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
It's hard to wash the blood.

426
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Come with me.

427
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
I promise to keep your secret.

428
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
If you don't want to be discovered,

429
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
come with me to change your clothes.

430
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Let's go.

431
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
This dress

432
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
has been in the box for years.

433
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I didn't expect it to be used now.

434
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Did you wear this for me?

435
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Yes.

436
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
I'm sorry.

437
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Did you wear this for me?

439
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
This dress is so beautiful.

440
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
I borrowed it from you.

441
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
You should wear it carefully.

442
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
I'll be careful.

443
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Dr. Lin, you're so nice.

444
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
You're like my aunt.

445
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
You're familiar with me and my aunt.

446
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Which one is closer to you?

447
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
A girl can't be a little bit reserved.

448
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
How can she get married in the future?

449
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Okay.

450
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
I'll be more reserved.

451
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Look at your hair.

452
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
It's dirty and messy.

453
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Wait.

454
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Eggs.

455
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Did you give it to me?

456
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
It's for the baby.

457
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
This is for washing your hair.

458
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
It's for girls.

459
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Hair is very important.

460
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
You should take good care of it.

461
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
So you usually use this to wash your hair?

462
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
No wonder your hair is black and shiny.

463
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
It's like a hair band.

464
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
But if I use this to wash my hair,

465
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
my mom will say I'm a loser.

466
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
She will beat me to death.

467
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
You should keep it.

468
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Okay.

469
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Stop talking.

470
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Go and wash your hair.

471
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
No.

472
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
My skin is rough.

473
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
It's too dirty.

474
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Girls

475
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
don't have a lot of personality like you.

476
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Okay.

477
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Go and wash your hair.

478
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Go.

479
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
I'll wait for you.

480
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Go.

481
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Go.

482
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Remember to wash your hair with warm water.

483
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Be careful.

484
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
You may burn your head.

485
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Okay.

486
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Dr. Lin

487
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
can I call you auntie Lin?

488
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
You look so close.

489
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Okay.

490
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
I'm sorry.

493
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
I'm sorry.

494
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
I'm sorry.

495
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm sorry.

496
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm sorry.

497
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I'm sorry.

498
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
I'm sorry.

499
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
I'm sorry.

500
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Did I see it wrong?

501
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Why does it look like that?

502
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Aunt Lin.

503
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Aunt Lin.

504
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
What are you thinking about?

505
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Nothing.

506
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I just saw you in the mirror.

507
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
It reminded me of an old friend.

508
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Old friend?

509
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Is that so?

510
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Aunt Li, you just said

511
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,160
that it's not that easy to

512
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
clean my body's poison.

513
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
That means

514
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
I'm about to die?

515
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
This poison is in your body.

516
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
It won't be like his illness.

517
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
All the poison will be triggered.

518
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Instead, there will be pain in the heart.

519
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
The pain of heart attack.

520
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
I thought

521
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
this kind of illness

522
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
would only be triggered in two days.

523
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
But I didn't expect

524
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
that the poison would spread too fast in your body.

525
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
I'm afraid that you can't survive three days.

526
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
But

527
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I will try my best to protect you.

528
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
I know.

529
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
It's just death.

530
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Everyone will experience it.

531
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
It's just that it will be too late.

532
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Aunt Li, thank you for the clothes you gave me.

533
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
I'll send it to you later.

534
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
I'll go and see if the medicine is ready.

535
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
I'll bring it to him when it's ready.

536
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Go.

537
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Why is there such a person

538
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
who wants to die in this world?

539
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I don't know.

540
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
I just want to be with you.

541
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
I just want to die.

542
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Jinxia,

543
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
you are so frank.

544
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
You are really liked.

545
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Even if there is only one chance left,

546
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,160
I will also

547
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
take you back from the hands of the wild king.

548
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Three days.

549
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I'm going to die in three days.

550
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Yuan Jinxia,

551
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
you still have a lot of things to do.

552
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
What were you thinking back then?

553
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
In order to save the wild king, you hurt your own body.

554
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
You are too impulsive.

555
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
What should I do now?

556
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Yuan Jinxia.

557
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Yuan Jinxia.

558
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
I don't know if I can make it now.

559
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
I'll just find Lin Yi

560
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
and let him get rid of the poison in my body.

561
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
What about the wild king?

562
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
He wants to die and live.

563
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
What does it have to do with me?

564
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
I'll be fine if I'm alive.

565
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
I'm too impulsive.

566
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I'm too impulsive.

567
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm too impulsive.

568
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
I'm too impulsive.

569
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
I'm too impulsive.

570
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
I'm too impulsive.

571
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm too impulsive.

572
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm too impulsive.

573
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
I'm too impulsive.

574
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm too impulsive.

575
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I'm too impulsive.

576
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Sir,

577
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
take the medicine.

578
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
You changed clothes?

579
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
My clothes got dirty.

580
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Dr. Lin lent me this.

581
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
I didn't expect it to be quite suitable.

582
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I've never seen you wear such clothes.

583
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
You look different.

584
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Really?

585
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Sir,

586
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
although this dress was made a few years ago,

587
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
you still look different.

588
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Although this dress was made a few years ago,

589
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
the fabric must be very expensive.

590
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Dr. Lin must have been a rich man.

591
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
People say that people depend on clothes.

592
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
You look like

593
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
you're a girl.

594
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
But I'm not used to it.

595
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Sir,

596
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
if I'm not here one day,

597
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
will you be sad?

598
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
What do you mean by not being here?

599
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Aren't you here right now?

600
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
I mean,

601
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
maybe,

602
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
what if I'm not here?

603
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
I'm not used to it.

604
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm not used to it.

605
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm not used to it.

606
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm not used to it.

607
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Maybe, what if?

608
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
What if

609
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
you can't see me again?

610
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Are you hiding something from me?

611
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
No, no.

612
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
How dare I lie to you?

613
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
No.

614
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Sir,

615
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
please take your medicine.

616
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
I won't bother you.

617
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Wait.

618
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Maybe,

619
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
I will.

620
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
What's wrong with your mouth?

621
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
It's not because of you.

622
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Say it.

623
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
But when you take care of him,

624
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
you should take care of yourself.

625
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Don't worry. I will take care of myself.

626
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Sir,

627
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
if I'm not here one day,

628
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
will you be sad?

629
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm not used to it.

630
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm not used to it.

631
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
I'm not used to it.

632
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I'm not used to it.

633
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
If I'm not here one day,

634
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
will you be sad?

635
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
What's hiding from me?

636
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Why do I have

637
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
a bad feeling?

638
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Jinxia.

639
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Jinxia.

640
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Jinxia.

641
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
What's wrong with you?

642
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
Why do you feel uncomfortable?

643
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Jinxia.

644
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Jinxia.

645
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Jinxia.

646
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Jinxia.

647
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Jinxia.

648
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Jinxia.

649
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Jinxia.

650
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Jinxia.

651
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Jinxia.

652
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
What's wrong with you?

653
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
I have a stomachache.

654
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
It doesn't hurt now.

655
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
I thought

656
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
something bad happened.

657
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
I'm fine.

658
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Nothing bad happened.

659
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
I'm fine.

660
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Don't say that.

661
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
I've done it for you.

662
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm just worried about you.

663
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
You've been running around for days.

664
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Why are you tired?

665
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm as strong as a bull.

666
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
I never feel tired.

667
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Xie Yuan.

668
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Where do you think

669
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
people go after they die?

670
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Why do you ask this question?

671
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm just curious.

672
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
You've been running around for days.

673
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
You must have thought about this question.

674
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
What's wrong with you?

675
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
If I do a lot of bad things,

676
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
I'll go to hell.

677
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
If I don't do bad things,

678
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
I'll go to reincarnation.

679
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Reincarnation?

680
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Maybe.

681
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I haven't died.

682
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
How can I know?

683
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
What do you want to do

684
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
in your next life?

685
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
In my next life?

686
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I'll be a wind and a water.

687
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
I won't be a man anyway.

688
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
It's good to be a man.

689
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I haven't done enough.

690
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
In my next life,

691
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
I'll ask Lord Yan

692
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
to give me a good birth.

693
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I'll have both parents and family.

694
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I'd better be

695
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
a little cook.

696
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
I won't be a cook.

697
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
I'll be a cook next year.

698
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
My life is so perfect.

699
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
You don't have to wait for the next life.

700
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
You can't be a financial person in this life.

701
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
You can be a financial woman.

702
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Just marry me.

703
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Xie Xiao, although I

704
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
want to beat you,

705
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
it's so good

706
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
to be your friend.

707
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Why are you so sad all of a sudden?

708
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
But I still thank you.

709
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Although I

710
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
don't just want to be your friend,

711
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
you should go first.

712
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Let me be alone for a while.

713
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
I'll be quiet here.

714
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Listen to the sound of the wind and birds.

715
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Don't love my Yan here.

716
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
You just finished writing it.

717
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
You're crossing the river to break the bridge.

718
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Okay.

719
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
If you want to be alone,

720
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I'll disappear.

721
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
If you want someone to accompany you,

722
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
I'll show up immediately.

723
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Go.

724
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Then I'll disappear.

725
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Jinxia, I'm leaving.

726
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Go.

727
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
What if there's no next life?

728
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Lin'er.

729
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Senior, sit down.

730
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Senior,

731
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
what do you want from me?

732
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Lin'er, I know

733
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
my medical skills are better

734
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
than yours.

735
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
I'm not a good person.

736
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm not a good person.

737
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
I know my medical skills are better than yours.

738
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
But I can see that

739
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Jinxia's body is already strong.

740
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Her body is getting worse day by day.

741
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Tell me the truth.

742
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Can you cure this poison?

743
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
I used Jinxia as a drug.

744
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Because I have a way to cure her

745
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
snake poison.

746
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
But I didn't expect that

747
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Jinxia's blood flow

748
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
is faster than usual.

749
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
It's faster than usual.

750
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
It's faster than usual.

751
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
Now I know

752
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
that the poison in Lu Yi's body

753
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,160
needs her blood as a drug.

754
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
What I'm worried about is

755
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
after Lu Yi's poison is removed,

756
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
it's too late to cure her poison.

757
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Now,

758
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
if the snake poison stays in her body for one more day,

759
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
it will be more dangerous.

760
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,160
The snake poison has begun

761
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
to eat her husband.

762
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
After that, she will die

763
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
because of the snake poison.

764
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Tell me.

765
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
What should we do now?

766
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
I'm looking for

767
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
the medical book left by her master.

768
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
I hope I can find a way to cure Jinxia.

769
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Okay. I'll help you.

770
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Master Lu,

771
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Dayang,

772
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Xie Xiao,

773
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Shu,

774
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
Aunt Lin,

775
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
and Shangguan.

776
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Don't blame me

777
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
for not saying goodbye.

778
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
I'm dying.

779
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Please make it clear.

780
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
I don't think I can live

781
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
until tomorrow.

782
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm sorry.

783
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
I'm a simple person.

784
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
I can't help

785
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
to say goodbye to you.

786
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Dayang,

787
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
tell master

788
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
to let him down.

789
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
If I have a next life,

790
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
I will still choose to be his apprentice.

791
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Finally, I can't live

792
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
without you.

793
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Finally,

794
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
I need you to help me

795
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
to dig out the private money

796
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
under the big stone

797
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
in the room of my house.

798
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Tell my mother

799
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
I don't want

800
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
to say sorry to her.

801
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I haven't written a will.

802
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
It's a bit much.

803
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Don't mind me.

804
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
I won't mind you

805
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
in the future.

806
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
You have to live a long life.

807
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Otherwise,

808
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
I won't let you down.

809
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
Yuan Jinxia,

810
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Liu.

811
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Impossible.

812
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Yuan Jinxia is like a cow.

813
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
How could she die?

814
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Doctor Lin,

815
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
what's going on?

816
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Let me tell you.

817
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
This thing

818
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
is related to the blue jade

819
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
that Lu Yi was poisoned.

820
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Jinxia let her

821
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
poison her body

822
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
to save Lu Yi.

823
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
She used her own blood to save Lu Yi.

824
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
I thought

825
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
after Lu Yi recovered,

826
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
her tongue could be cured.

827
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
But I didn't expect her body

828
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
to be so special, with a lot of toxins.

829
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

830
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Sir Lu,

831
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
after working with you,

832
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
we often

833
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
have different opinions.

834
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
But from you,

835
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
I've learned a lot.

836
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
You saved me.

837
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
I'm grateful.

838
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
I saved you.

839
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,160
I don't need your gratitude.

840
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
I just love money.

841
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
I want money till I die.

842
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
I hope you can help me

843
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
to apply for a pension

844
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
for saving your life.

845
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
So my mother

846
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
can live a good life.

847
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
I'll give you your name card

848
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
and sword

849
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
at the door.

850
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
I hope you

851
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
can live a good life.

852
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
If Jinxia dies,

853
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
you'll be the victims.

854
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
You'll be the victims.

855
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Jinxiu, what are you doing?

856
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
Calm down. Let go.

857
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
How can I calm down?

858
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Jinxia is still unconscious.

859
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
How can I calm down?

860
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
The most important thing now

861
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
is to find Jinxia.

862
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
What if she has an accident?

863
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
We'll split up to find her.

864
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Let go.

865
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Let go.

866
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Let's go.

867
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Let's go.

868
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Jinxia.

869
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Jinxia.

870
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
The seven chains of death

871
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
I'm so scared.

872
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,920
Jinxia.

873
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,080
But I'm an orphan.

874
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,160
Where should I go?

875
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,200
Where should I go?

876
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,240
Jinxia.

877
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,760
Jinxia.

878
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,360
I'm afraid you may niece yourself to Sect Leader Wei.

879
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,320
Because I don't want you to die,

880
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,760
our sect

881
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,320
will never forgive measures to prevent crippil Culture.

882
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,480
They say

883
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,860
that flowersurers

884
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,300
who�v pierce their stage

885
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,280
can1

886
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,680
fight to protect the rarelyhalos,

887
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,800
콧 everything

888
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,500
to protect the vermilion

889
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,680
as long as they face the hem of technology.

890
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,640
And

891
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,160
I may convince

892
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
to fight with the people

893
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,520
to send afraid them on the battlefield.

894
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Where are you?

895
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,120
Girl.

896
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,560
Jinxia.

897
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,920
Girl.

898
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,800
Jinxia.

899
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,720
Take a look at them.

900
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,400
Did you have an affair in a while?

901
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,800
Your sapphire is too crystal clear.

902
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,200
I need some other things.

903
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,320
Do you have work to deal with along the way?

904
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,760
Isn't it for me?

905
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,440
Do you need me to do, too?

906
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,280
You still want to see the mountains?

907
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,280
Of course.

908
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,440
Isn't your house mine?

909
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,720
I need your assistance

910
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:27,160
I'm lost in the lonesome rain and the chaotic intersection.

911
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,160
The wind howls and the boat sails.

912
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,160
My heart is empty.

913
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,160
Thousands of miles of ambush come and go.

914
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Who is born out of the world?

915
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,160
The fate is hard to compare with.

916
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:53,160
When I close my eyes, I can see your face.

917
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,160
When I open my eyes, I can see the cold back of the mirror.

918
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Who has conquered the world?

919
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,160
No sound.

920
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,160
The dark clouds rise.

921
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,160
The fate turns.

922
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,160
I see the changes in the world.

923
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,160
It's like parting.

924
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,160
It's too sad to part.

925
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:34,160
I remember the day when I met you.

926
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Your white hair was like a white snow.

927
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,160
We spent our years together.

928
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:51,160
In the twinkling of an eye, a word was said.

929
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
The Long Ballad

930
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Episode 18
