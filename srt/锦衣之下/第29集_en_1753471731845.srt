What are you looking at?

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,760
Still running around?

60
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,320
No one to worry about you?

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
Be obedient, you know?

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
What are you looking at?

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
Is what I said wrong?

64
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,080
It seems that Yuan Bu Kui

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,240
has been very fond of the subordinate.

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,160
He...

67
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
Sir...

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,640
Are you Lord Lu?

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
What?

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,200
Do you need me to prove it to you?

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,840
You're fine!

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,880
When did you recover?

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
Before I went to Master Yuan Ming's room,

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,240
I had recovered.

75
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,040
It seems that Yuan Bu Kui

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,880
likes to take advantage of me

77
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,840
when I'm sick.

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,080
No, no, no.

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,560
I dare not. I dare not.

80
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm just worried about your safety.

81
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,920
But you're so good at pretending.

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Sir, you're fine!

83
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,120
I'll tell Lin Yi and the others.

84
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,760
Wait.

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
Don't tell anyone about this.

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,880
Why?

87
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
There's no such reason.

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Okay.

89
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,240
Another face of Yan Wang.

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
But he's cute when he was a kid.

91
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,600
What are you talking about?

92
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,160
I said you were cute when you were a kid.

93
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
But speaking of which, Sir,

94
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,040
do you remember who poisoned you?

95
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,800
You want me to

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,680
do nothing

97
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,400
for you?

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,280
You know who I really am?

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,520
I only

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
want to tell you the way.

101
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,000
Your internal strength

102
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,280
is really powerful.

103
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,880
You're only acting now.

104
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
This beast who is so familiar with the world

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
is pretending to be a master of high rank.

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
I'll go and kill him right now.

107
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
Come back.

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't be so impulsive.

109
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,240
Listen to me.

110
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,520
Xiao Lu Yi.

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
Are you up?

112
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,360
Cooperate.

113
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,280
Xiao Lu Yi.

114
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,000
It's time to take your medicine.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,880
Xiao Lu Yi.

116
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,400
Come here.

117
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,720
It's time to take your medicine.

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,760
How does he feel?

119
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,560
He just woke up.

120
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
He's not in a bad mood.

121
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,320
Come on.

122
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,520
Drink it.

123
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,080
Come here.

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,440
Come here.

125
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,480
Don't move.

126
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,280
Don't move.

127
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,680
Open your mouth.

128
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
Thank you, Yuan Yuan.

129
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,880
Let me feed him.

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,840
It's okay.

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,400
Xiao Lu Yi is the best.

132
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,560
He can drink it all in one go.

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Right?

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,400
Drink it.

135
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Hurry.

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,040
Thank you, Yuan Yuan.

137
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
I can't touch the tiger skin.

138
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,280
I can only pray for him in my heart.

139
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,200
Open your mouth.

140
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,120
Drink it.

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,480
It's not good.

142
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,120
Take it down.

143
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,760
What do you mean, Lu Yi?

144
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,040
Take it down.

145
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,200
Don't feed him.

146
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,200
Take it down.

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,240
Let me.

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,520
It hurts.

149
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,960
Are you okay?

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,200
Go away.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
Okay.

152
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Thank you, Young Master.

153
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Lord Lu is a child now.

154
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
Why are you angry with the child?

155
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,240
What should we do now?

156
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,720
The murderer didn't catch it.

157
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Lord Lu became like this.

158
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Who sent my master to the capital?

159
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,640
We found some poison at the crime scene.

160
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,600
And the poison can not only checking human's body

161
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,200
but can contact with the medicine

162
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,480
which can enjoy a long life or 1000 days old.

163
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,120
It can make two different types of medicine.

164
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,680
Itred.

165
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,480
It's probably immortal medicine.

166
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,360
Immortal medicine?

167
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,400
There is no such thing.

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,040
It's nothing

169
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
than some nutritional supplements.

170
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,640
But

171
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
It's fine.

172
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,340
But if you take this pill for a long time,

173
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,340
it can indeed extend your life.

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,600
It's a bit longer than normal people.

175
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Master said that he got a prescription for an old medicine.

176
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
But I'm not sure

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,540
where he got this prescription from.

178
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,240
There really is an old medicine?

179
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,540
When His Majesty values his master so much,

180
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,540
it's also because his master will make the Yan Shou pill.

181
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,240
But the people around him are dead.

182
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
He's left alone and alone.

183
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
It's fine. I'll definitely be with you.

184
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Jinxia, we'll go back first.

185
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,840
Take good care of him.

186
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,040
Tell me if you need anything.

187
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
I'll leave too.

188
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Master is old.

189
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,840
He's waiting for me to play chess with him.

190
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,040
You're going to find Master Yuan Ming?

191
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
I'll go with you.

192
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,640
I'll go too.

193
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,840
Why are you going?

194
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Play chess with me.

195
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,240
Let's go.

196
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Let's practice.

197
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,240
Playing chess is fun, isn't it?

198
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Let's go.

199
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,240
Let's go.

200
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
Brother Xie, you're so good.

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,040
Am I good?

202
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,640
You're good.

203
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Hey, do you want to learn?

204
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,840
Okay, teach me.

205
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,840
Come here.

206
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,240
Take this sword.

207
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,640
Oh, take it.

208
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,440
Put this wooden bucket on your head.

209
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
On my head?

210
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,040
Go.

211
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
Can you do it?

212
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,840
Brother Xie,

213
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,240
why don't you show me again?

214
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
I can't.

215
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,840
Open your eyes and look at it.

216
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,240
Give it to me.

217
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,440
How is it?

218
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,640
How is it?

219
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,840
It's okay.

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,040
Brother Xie, your body is wet.

221
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Let me wipe it for you.

222
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Your clothes are dirty.

223
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,240
How about this?

224
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,640
Your saliva is...

225
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
Yes, the water in the bucket is clean.

226
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,840
Come on.

227
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,640
Little rascal, you're touching me.

228
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,440
Brother Xie, what are you doing?

229
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,040
Don't run.

230
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,640
Brother Xie, you brat.

231
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,840
My sleeves are clean.

232
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,840
Let me wipe it for you.

233
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Wipe what?

234
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm doing this for you.

235
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
Brother Xie, why are you doing this?

236
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,440
Come back.

237
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,040
Ling'er, did you hear that?

238
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,640
If I'm not wrong,

239
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,440
the formula of the old medicine

240
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
is the medicine essence that was lost in the valley.

241
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
Master once said

242
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,240
that the clue was broken

243
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,040
when we were looking for the essence.

244
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,640
I didn't expect that

245
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,640
it was related to Yuan Ming.

246
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
The emperor of Shengchuan is pursuing the longevity cloth.

247
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
I wonder if Yuan Ming is willing to give it back to me.

248
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,240
He dares not to give it back.

249
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Even if he doesn't give it back,

250
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,240
I will take it back.

251
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,640
What I'm most worried about now

252
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
is that Master Yuan Ming

253
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
used the incomplete formula to do evil things

254
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
and caused trouble.

255
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,840
Master.

256
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,240
Master.

257
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,240
Stop.

258
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,440
Why did you come in without knocking?

259
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,040
I've been used to entering your room a few days ago.

260
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Please forgive me.

261
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
In that case,

262
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,840
why don't you train me

263
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,040
to be more used to it?

264
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
Help me change my clothes.

265
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,040
Something is wrong.

266
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,040
Is Master suffering from a toxic sequela?

267
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
He still thinks that I'm his maid

268
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
or his mother?

269
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,440
No.

270
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
I have to test him.

271
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,640
Master.

272
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm not a maid.

273
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm just a servant.

274
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
I'm just a servant.

275
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,840
Are you eight years old

276
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,440
or thirteen?

277
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,840
Twenty-two.

278
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,640
What's wrong?

279
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
Nothing.

280
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
It's really the father of Lord Yan.

281
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,240
No wonder Xie Yuan came to complain to me.

282
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,440
Who taught him to play with me

283
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
when I was unconscious?

284
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,440
Master, are you having an affair with Wei Ming

285
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,640
or a love affair?

286
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,640
What do you think?

287
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,240
Didn't I give it to you?

288
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
Why is it with me?

289
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,440
You asked for it yourself.

290
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
You returned it to me after I asked for it.

291
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,240
After all, it's yours.

292
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,640
I'm not going to take it off.

293
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,440
Remember.

294
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,640
You can't take it off without my permission.

295
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
Master, have some soup.

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,440
I made this.

297
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,440
It tastes good.

298
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,040
Try it.

299
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
By the way, where is Cen Fu?

300
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,240
I asked Cen Fu to investigate the related

301
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,840
related crimes before Yuan Ming gave me the medicine.

302
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,840
No wonder.

303
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,840
The day you were in the accident,

304
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,240
Cen Fu came from outside.

305
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,040
It seems that

306
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,040
he has something important to report to you.

307
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,240
It seems that he has found out something.

308
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,440
Tell Cen Fu that I'm recovering.

309
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,640
Tell him to come to me.

310
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,440
Yes.

311
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,240
Wait.

312
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,840
There's one more thing.

313
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
What can I do for you, sir?

314
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,040
Keep an eye on Yuan Ming.

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,640
Keep an eye on him?

316
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,240
He...

317
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,640
He didn't move.

318
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,440
Is he asleep?

319
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,040
Fine.

320
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I'll sleep for a while.

321
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,840
The incense is burning so slowly.

322
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,640
I wonder if Lord Lu has found the doll.

323
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
I don't know.

324
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I don't know.

325
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
I don't know.

326
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
I don't know.

327
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
I don't know.

328
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,440
You...

329
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,240
Senior.

330
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,840
It's me.

331
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,640
Good girl.

332
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Miss Yuan.

333
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,040
What?

334
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
Are you interested in the cultivation of the Great Sage?

335
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,240
Master.

336
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
My mother always says that I'm not calm.

337
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,240
She hopes that I can learn from the master

338
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,440
and cultivate my body and health.

339
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,640
I heard that the Danqing Pavilion is highly valued by His Majesty.

340
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,440
If I can get the master's guidance,

341
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,240
I'll be able to make a good person.

342
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm not sure if I can make a good person.

343
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,440
I'm not sure if I can make a good person.

344
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,440
I'm not sure if I can make a good person.

345
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm not sure if I can make a good person.

346
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
I've made it.

347
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,840
It's rare for you to be so thoughtful.

348
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,040
Then I'll teach you a few

349
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,840
techniques of studying.

350
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,840
The beginning of cultivation.

351
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,440
Sit with your heart.

352
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
Stay away from the mirror.

353
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,840
Have nothing.

354
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,640
Not aware of the object.

355
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
Self-intoxication.

356
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,440
The heart is the core.

357
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Thank you for your care these days.

358
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I was poisoned by Master Yuan Mi.

359
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
I caused some confusion in my mind.

360
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Luckily, I'm now recovered.

361
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
I didn't tell you because I wanted to

362
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
investigate the conspiracy without your protection.

363
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
If there's anything wrong, please forgive me.

364
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,440
I know you're a sly boy.

365
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,440
But it's okay. I can understand.

366
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,440
So the reason why you're here is Yuan Ming.

367
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
That's right.

368
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,440
That's why I came to the secret room.

369
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
I didn't expect you to be in the secret room.

370
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Did you find any clues?

371
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
I went to investigate Yuan Ming

372
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
because we guessed that

373
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
the prescription Master Yuan Ming had

374
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
was the long-lost medicine of our Medicine King Valley.

375
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,440
So the reason why Er Pang was poisoned

376
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,440
is because he used the long-lost medicine

377
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
that Yuan Ming had?

378
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
That's right.

379
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Uncle, auntie, did you...

380
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Sir, why are you here?

381
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
I've been looking for you for a long time.

382
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
You don't know?

383
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
You...

384
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
You...

385
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
They all know?

386
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
We all know.

387
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
That's good.

388
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
So I won't have to keep a secret.

389
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
It's hard.

390
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
You're a liar.

391
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Sir, you don't know.

392
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
I was there last night.

393
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm so tired.

394
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
You don't know how I survived.

395
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
My legs hurt and numb.

396
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
No wonder I've never seen a liar do it.

397
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I can't stand it.

398
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Miss Yuan is talking about my bad words again.

399
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Xiaolan, no, no.

400
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Dr. Lin, I've brought the medicine you asked for.

401
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Just tell me if you need it.

402
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Thank you.

403
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Lan Qingquan, come.

404
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
You're so mean.

405
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
You don't even wait for me.

406
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
So many people are here.

407
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Xiao Luyi changed into new clothes.

408
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
He's quite energetic.

409
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
I just learned a few moves.

410
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Let me show you.

411
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Thank you.

412
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Lu.

413
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Thank you.

414
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
You're so cool.

415
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Thank you.

416
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Let's go.

417
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
You're fighting back?

418
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Stop it.

419
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
He's awake now.

420
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Lu.

421
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
You're not stupid.

422
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
You're fooling me.

423
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Stop it.

424
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
What are you doing?

425
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
You're the one who's stupid.

426
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
You're the one who's fooling everyone.

427
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
What do you mean?

428
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
You spilled water on my head.

429
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
You even put saliva on my face.

430
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Okay.

431
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Lu.

432
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm not stupid.

433
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Lu.

434
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
You bullied him when he was sick.

435
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Get out.

436
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Let's go.

437
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
What a naughty boy.

438
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I heard that

439
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
fate is unpredictable.

440
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Fate is like wind.

441
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
It's not fixed.

442
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,440
It's fate to meet and to part.

443
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Love is like meeting and to part.

444
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Is it that good?

445
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Shangguan.

446
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Can you turn around and look at me?

447
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
I'll be nice to you and take care of you.

448
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
The sky is empty.

449
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Why do I look at you?

450
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Why do I laugh?

451
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Yang Yue.

452
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,440
Why do you insist on it?

453
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
I'm not stupid.

454
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
I'm not stupid.

455
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm not stupid.

456
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
I'm not stupid.

457
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm not stupid.

458
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
I'm not stupid.

459
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
I want to ask you a favor.

460
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
You must agree.

461
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
What is it?

462
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
I want you to go to Guanyi with me

463
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
and propose to Jinxia.

464
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
But Xie Xiao is guilty.

465
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
He is ashamed of Shangguan.

466
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
So he told his father

467
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
to terminate the engagement with Shangguan Xi.

468
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
From now on,

469
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,440
the marriage of men and women is irrelevant.

470
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,440
I want to make this decision.

471
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Xie Xiao.

472
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
I'm tired.

473
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Sir.

474
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
What did you find?

475
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Sir.

476
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
The case of the brothers in the capital.

477
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
It was discovered that Yuan Ming was not a Fang family before.

478
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
But a general of the martial arts world.

479
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
He was in charge of the Danqing Pavilion not long after.

480
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
He offered the Yan Shou Dan to the court.

481
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440
So someone is behind this.

482
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Yes.

483
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
I followed the order

484
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
and checked the whole Danqing Pavilion.

485
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
What's suspicious is that

486
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
we didn't find Yuan Ming's Lian Dan Fang.

487
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
And there are only a few disciples of Danqing Pavilion.

488
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
When Yuan Ming was practicing the Dan,

489
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
he forbade anyone from going around.

490
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,440
They don't know where this Lian Dan Fang is located.

491
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
I've already known the overall situation.

492
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Prepare.

493
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Tomorrow morning,

494
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
take Yuan Ming to the capital.

495
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Yes.

496
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Yes.

497
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm sorry.

498
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm sorry.

499
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
I'm sorry.

500
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I'm sorry.

501
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
I'm sorry.

502
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I'm sorry.

505
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
I'm sorry.

507
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm sorry.

509
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
I'm sorry.

510
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
I'm sorry.

511
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
I'm sorry.

512
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
I'm sorry.

513
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm sorry.

514
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
I'm sorry.

515
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm sorry.

516
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
I'm sorry.

517
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
I'm sorry.

518
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
I'm sorry.

519
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
I'm sorry.

520
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
I'm sorry.

521
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
I'm sorry.

522
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
I'm sorry.

523
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
I'm sorry.

524
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
I'm sorry.

525
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
So sorry.

526
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
I'm sorry.

527
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
So sorry.

528
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Sorry.

529
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Sorry.

530
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
Sorry.

531
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm sorry.

532
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I'm sorry.

533
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
Sorry.

534
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Sorry!

535
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
I'm sorry!

536
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm sorry.

537
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I'm sorry.

538
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Sorry, I'm sorry.

539
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Sorry, I'm sorry.

540
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Sorry, I'm sorry.

541
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Sorry.

542
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Sometimes overlooking the Until Let's meet again.

543
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I'm sorry.

544
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Sorry, I'm sorry.

545
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm sorry.

546
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
I'm sorry.

547
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Sorry.

548
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Sorry, I'm sorry.

549
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Sorry, I'm sorry.

550
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Sorry, I'm sorry.

551
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Sorry.

552
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
What's wrong?

553
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,360
Nothing.

554
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,400
Why do you keep staring at me?

555
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,680
Because you look like a man.

556
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
You look good.

557
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,040
You just found it out now?

558
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,600
Maybe I'm not used to it

559
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,080
after I become an adult.

560
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:16,440
I can't see you even if I blink.

561
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Bad news!

562
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
Bad news!

563
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,560
Bad news!

564
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
What's wrong, Lan Pianzi?

565
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,400
Tell me.

566
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,040
Third...

567
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,760
Third Young Master.

568
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,880
Third Young Master is missing.

569
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,560
What?

570
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,400
Let's go and check it out.

571
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,000
Go.

572
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,280
Go.

573
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,760
Look.

574
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,960
He's gone since this morning.

575
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,440
Have you searched other places?

576
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Yes.

577
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,040
Otherwise, how can you say he's gone?

578
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,920
Third Young Master doesn't look like Yu Han.

579
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
It's empty.

580
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,160
It seems like he left.

581
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,200
He ran away?

582
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
Why did he leave at this time?

583
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
I...

584
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
What did you find?

585
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,280
I don't know what it is.

586
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,680
Some grey powder.

587
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,480
I remember I saw this in Lin Yi's room.

588
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,640
Yes.

589
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,040
The thing that Doctor Lin mentioned about the elixir.

590
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Where's Master Yuan Ming?

591
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
He's gone.

592
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
He's gone.

593
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
He's gone.

594
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
He's gone.

595
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
He's gone.

596
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
He's gone.

597
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
He's gone.

598
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
He's gone.

599
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
He's gone.

600
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
He's gone.

601
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
He's gone.

602
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I don't know either.

603
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,040
I didn't see him since this morning.

604
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,040
He should be sitting in the hall at this time.

605
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Come with me.

606
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Third Young Master.

607
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,840
I never thought that

608
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
you've already discovered my secret.

609
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Then I have to send you to the heaven myself.

610
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
If I do,

611
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,840
I have to go to the Lotus City immediately.

612
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,640
No one can ruin my big plan.

613
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Master.

614
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,240
You guys.

615
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Third Young Master.

616
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,640
How did you know that this place is big?

617
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
You're soft-hearted.

618
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,040
For my big plan,

619
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,040
I spared your life because you're the imperial guard.

620
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
For your physical strength,

621
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,240
you've bewitched the elixir soul.

622
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,440
You've made me feel guilty for many years.

623
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,840
The way to kill the elixir of the Pavilion of Pure Purity

624
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,240
is to give out poisonous elixir.

625
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,440
Now, all the evidence is here.

626
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,240
What else do you have to say?

627
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
What's going on?

628
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Senior.

629
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,640
In my whole life,

630
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,040
I've been addicted to elixir.

631
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,440
In any elixir,

632
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
there's only a tiny bit of poison.

633
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Yes.

634
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
This is a house that we've been looking for

635
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,440
for a hundred years.

636
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,040
A house that's old and well-kept.

637
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,840
This is my house.

638
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,440
This is my house.

639
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,240
What are you doing?

640
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,040
Senior Lan.

641
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Listen to me.

642
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,440
He's afraid that things will go wrong

643
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,840
and he'll kill someone.

644
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Are you crazy?

645
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,640
Are you out of your mind?

646
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,440
Look carefully.

647
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,240
That's our master.

648
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,640
How could he kill someone?

649
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,240
You must be lying to me.

650
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,240
It's impossible that our master killed him.

651
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,440
I'm not lying to you.

652
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

653
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Come.

654
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
It's all my fault.

655
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
It's all my fault.

656
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,240
I was too scared.

657
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,840
I was too timid.

658
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
But

659
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
I didn't have any evidence.

660
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,840
Even if I told you,

661
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,640
you wouldn't believe me.

662
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,640
I was afraid that our master

663
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,840
would kill me

664
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,240
when I found out his secret.

665
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
I pretended to be innocent

666
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,440
and then I went to the palace.

667
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,240
I really couldn't do anything.

668
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,840
We wanted to find a chance to leave Danjing Pavilion.

669
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
But our master

670
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,040
was always by my side.

671
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,840
Until

672
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,640
the night when Xiao Xin died.

673
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,840
If I had told you earlier,

674
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
he wouldn't have died.

675
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,640
If I had told you earlier,

676
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
he wouldn't have died.

677
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,640
It's all my fault.

678
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,640
Nonsense.

679
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,640
I don't believe it.

680
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
It's true.

681
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Master.

682
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Master.

683
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,840
Explain it to them.

684
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,440
Explain it to them.

685
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Tell them

686
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,640
that you didn't kill him, right?

687
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Tell them

688
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
that I believe you.

689
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,640
They will believe you too.

690
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,040
Tell them.

691
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,640
Third Uncle was right.

692
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
I killed him.

693
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,440
I killed him.

694
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,840
I killed him.

695
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,040
I killed him.

696
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,840
I killed him.

697
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,840
Who let them find out my secret?

698
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,240
In order to prevent them from telling you this,

699
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,640
I had to deal with them.

700
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Xiao Lan.

701
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,040
He...

702
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
He killed him.

703
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,640
He killed them.

704
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,240
It's a long story.

705
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
It's a long story.

706
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,440
You are a human.

707
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,240
You killed innocent people so brutally.

708
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,640
It's a long story.

709
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
The emperor was

710
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,240
asking for immortality.

711
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,540
As long as my immortality

712
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,840
is done,

713
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
I will be

714
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,240
above all of you.

715
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,640
I will live with heaven.

716
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,040
Do you really think

717
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,440
there is any immortality in the world?

718
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
I tell you.

719
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Yes.

720
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,240
There is.

721
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,840
But the elixir

722
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,440
hasn't been used yet.

723
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,040
But I tell you.

724
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,840
The two prescriptions

725
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
they left me

726
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,240
will be true.

727
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Xiao Xi.

728
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Xiao Xi.

729
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Xiao Xi.

730
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,840
Xiao Lan.

731
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Xiao Lan.

732
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Xiao Xi.

733
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm sorry.

734
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,840
Xiao Lan.

735
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I'm sorry.

736
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,440
I'm sorry.

737
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,840
I'm sorry, Xiao Xi.

738
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
I shouldn't have brought you to Danqi River.

739
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,640
I shouldn't have brought you to Danqi River.

740
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
I'm the one who caused you to die.

741
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Xiao Lan.

742
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,640
I'm the one who caused you to die.

743
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,240
Xiao Xi.

744
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,640
Xiao Lan.

745
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,040
It's not right.

746
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,440
Xiao Xi.

747
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm going to die with you!

748
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,840
Zi Fu.

749
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Let's go take a break.

750
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,440
Yes.

751
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,700
It's still difficult for me to go home,

752
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,520
I can kill all hope and break with Nevertheless.

753
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,080
Come here.

754
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,520
The other half of my shout.

755
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,720
Come over here.

756
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,000
You aren't in charge of killing or destroying people,

757
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,040
how could you protect this?

758
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,840
This is not about immortality at all.

759
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,720
Nonsense.

760
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,060
Official.

761
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,840
Official.

762
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,300
Please give the pill back to me, OK?

763
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Yuan Ming.

764
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:49,400
Who gave you the drug crit

765
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,440
and the imp jsem.

766
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Who touched it?

767
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,440
Give me the pill first.

768
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Give it to me.

769
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
If you don't tell me,

770
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,360
I'll crush the pill.

771
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,280
No, no, no.

772
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,520
I'll tell you.

773
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,400
Let me think about it.

774
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,080
The pill.

775
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,960
Who?

776
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,200
Who touched it?

777
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,360
It's her.

778
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,520
She touched the pill.

779
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,440
You.

780
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,160
It's her.

781
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,680
There's no one else except her.

782
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
It's her.

783
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,120
I...

784
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,520
I didn't.

785
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,520
I didn't.

786
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,120
Sir.

787
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,640
It must be this lunatic.

788
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,120
He thinks he can't protect himself.

789
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,760
He wants to make me his back.

790
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,320
I've never touched the pill for the emperor.

791
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,040
Lin Yi.

792
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,320
Look at this.

793
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,400
This is Tian Nanxin powder.

794
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,880
It's poisonous.

795
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,520
Where did you get it?

796
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,520
Master Sanshou's room.

797
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,360
Are you going to tell me now

798
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,040
or will you tell me in the imperial prison?

799
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,040
Please spare my life.

800
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,320
Please spare my life.

801
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,240
I...

802
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,800
I really didn't know

803
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,360
there was poison in it.

804
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,720
It was a month ago.

805
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Someone drew a heavy spell

806
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
and asked me to put this pill

807
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
in Master's single furnace.

808
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,160
I was already in a bad mood.

809
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,560
But I never thought

810
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,920
I would hurt the emperor.

811
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,080
I deserve to die.

812
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,880
You ruined my life.

813
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,320
You're so ungrateful.

814
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,080
Guards.

815
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,480
Yes.

816
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,440
Take him back

817
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,680
and draw the portrait.

818
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,120
Yes.

819
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,120
Sir.

820
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,320
Sir.

821
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,120
Please give me the pill.

822
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,560
Please.

823
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,080
Yueming.

824
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,680
There's no medicine

825
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,840
that can make you live forever.

826
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,640
I hope you can go back to your original self.

827
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,200
Sir, no.

828
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,680
Don't go back to your original self.

829
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,680
No.

830
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,280
No.

831
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,720
My medicine.

832
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,080
Let me go.

833
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,200
Sir.

834
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,200
Sir.

835
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,640
I know.

836
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I know there's no medicine in the factory.

837
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,280
I'll kill you all.

838
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,640
No.

839
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,200
Guard Yan.

840
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,000
Miss Zhai.

841
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,120
You're in a hurry.

842
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,240
Is there anything important

843
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,160
that you want to tell me?

844
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,640
You want us to find Lin Ling

845
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,960
and take her back to the capital.

846
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,440
Lin Ling?

847
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,880
The female doctor of Feng Ling'ao?

848
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,760
Since I served you,

849
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
I've never seen you

850
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
send Guard Yan out

851
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,120
to find a female doctor.

852
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,960
It seems that this Lin Ling

853
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,600
is very important to you.

854
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,520
I don't know about you.

855
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,400
But since you told me to do it,

856
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,240
we just need to do it according to the order.

857
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,120
Don't ask too much.

858
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm afraid you won't like it.

859
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,560
Thank you for your advice.

860
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,800
I'll remember it.

861
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,240
Go and find out

862
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,720
where she is now

863
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,360
and who she is with.

864
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,720
Once everything is arranged,

865
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,120
we'll act.

866
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,560
I'll send someone to find out.

867
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,840
Guard Yan, don't worry.

868
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,800
Thank you, Miss Zhai.

869
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,880
She's dead?

870
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,880
That three-leafed beast just drew a circle

871
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,880
and killed it with a cold arrow.

872
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,680
I'm afraid it's too late to go after it.

873
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,240
Please punish me.

874
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Father! Father!

875
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,640
From Lord Xu's recommendation of the original name to His Majesty,

876
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,920
to the poison of the elixir that His Majesty took,

877
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,800
the person behind it

878
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,440
is useful.

879
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,520
You mean

880
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
you've figured out who ordered it?

881
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,520
You'll know it in detail.

882
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
If you really want to harm His Majesty,

883
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,280
why bother

884
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
to add the poison of the elixir

885
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,160
to the poison of the elixir?

886
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,080
If the person who poisoned it

887
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,200
wasn't for His Majesty,

888
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,680
why...

889
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,880
After the case,

890
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,720
someone will be out of favor.

891
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,320
And someone

892
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,360
will be more loyal.

893
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,680
Zifeng,

894
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,320
ask someone to

895
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,760
give this letter to my father tomorrow.

896
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,000
He'll know

897
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
how to report to His Majesty.

898
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,960
Yes.

899
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,320
What about you, Your Excellency?

900
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,320
I'll go to Hangzhou.

901
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,800
What are you going to do there?

902
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,720
Someone came to tell me about

903
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
Mao Haifeng and Zhailanye's infirmary.

904
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,520
If I don't go to investigate,

905
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,960
it's not good, right?

906
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,800
I'll go with you.

907
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,760
Dear, here's your tea.

908
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,160
Okay, thank you.

909
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,640
Take care.

910
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,840
Okay.

911
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,320
I'm leaving.

912
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,920
Alright.

913
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,440
See you tomorrow.

914
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:38,880
Okay.

915
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,640
Boss.

916
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,520
Thank you.

917
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,640
You don't know that I can eat for you so we won't talk.

918
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
My wife doesn't allow me to be wasn concealed.

919
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,760
Also, my brother doesn't want to study喜歡不喜欢

920
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,320
as well as love what he wants.

921
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,640
Zhang USHANG and Li KANGE

922
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,880
want to know about this.

923
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,320
Also, I can help you prove and attack him.

924
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,280
Brother,

925
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,600
I have never seen Zhang USHANG

926
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,560
being easily dared to kill the younger brother.

927
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,040
I'll go find Xie Xiao.

928
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,240
I'll go find Jin Xia.

929
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,560
My father isn't here today.

930
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,680
I must bring him back safely.

931
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,800
Are you sure you're only going to find Miss Yuan?

932
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,200
You don't have any other intentions?

933
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,600
I...

934
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,600
I'm sure I'm going to...

935
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,320
find Miss Yuan.

936
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,040
We're adults now.

937
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,120
Don't do anything childish.

938
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm not going to find Miss Yuan.

939
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,560
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

940
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,800
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

941
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

942
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,560
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

943
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

944
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,400
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

945
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,800
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

946
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,200
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

947
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,600
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

948
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,800
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

949
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,200
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

950
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,400
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

951
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,600
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

952
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,800
I'm going to find Jin Xia.

953
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,000

Can't compare with fate
