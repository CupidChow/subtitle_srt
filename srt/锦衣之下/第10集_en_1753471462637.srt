46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,320
I just sad

47
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
feeling down

48
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,080
or nothing

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,880
without saying things

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
please stay with me

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,160
I know that once I get to the bottom of it, I will be...

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Sir, it's your turn.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Changsheng, my cousin's memory is not good.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
I can't remember the words.

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Let me do it again.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,160
I want to be a good woman.

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,160
I want to be a good dream.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I want to be a good woman.

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,160
I don't know how to say it.

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Sister, I think about it.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,160
It's all Xu Xian's bad luck.

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,160
If we meet again, I will definitely forgive him.

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:43,160
I only found out today that only Qing is sincere to me.

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:53,160
How about you and me becoming friends and go to Qingcheng together?

65
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Let me be your wife.

66
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:10,160
I will be content with Qing.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
You...

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Changsheng.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I don't understand.

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Where did you sing?

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Bai Shecu. Qing and Bai Shecu.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Bai Shecu?

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Why don't I remember that Bai Shecu sang like this?

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
I made it up.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Why don't you ask Bai to find Xu Xian?

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Xu Xian is weak and timid.

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
A monk provoked his wife to be put under the thunder tower.

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Such a stupid person doesn't deserve Bai Suzhen.

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Good point.

80
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,160
But don't let the teacher hear it.

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
She is the most particular about the lyrics.

82
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
It's hard to confuse.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Then we will have to rely on Changsheng to take care of it.

84
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
In the future, we will help each other.

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
By the way, Changsheng.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,160
What kind of show do we usually rehearse in the Spring Festival class?

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,160
All of our performances are here now.

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Let me see.

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
But the teacher often makes some new parts.

90
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Let's see.

91
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Wu Zetian, Ye Zhu Lin.

92
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Why isn't there the first incense?

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Isn't the first incense the most popular show in the Spring Festival class?

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,160
How do you know about the first incense?

95
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
No one mentioned it for years.

96
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,160
We also heard about it.

97
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,160
The most popular show in the Spring Festival class is the first incense.

98
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Changsheng.

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Changsheng.

100
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Leader.

101
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,160
I will go lighten the clothes.

102
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Leader.

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Young people.

104
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Don't be too curious.

105
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,160
In the Spring Festival class, don't ask anything you shouldn't.

106
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
You must be careful and careful.

107
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Do you understand?

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Yes.

109
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
What you should do now is to practice the basic skills.

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Once you have the basics, you will have a chance to perform.

111
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Okay.

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Thank you, leader.

113
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
We will practice hard.

114
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Keep practicing.

115
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Yes.

116
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Yang Yang Zhe Jin.

117
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Kong Gu Fu.

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
I will go.

119
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
He must have something to do with it.

120
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Lang Yan.

121
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,660
We'll see.

122
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,060
All these years,

123
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,340
I think you must be mad at me.

124
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,300
You're still blaming me for what happened that year.

125
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,300
Without Yun Zheyue,

126
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,620
how can she be a shadow?

127
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,020
Yun Zheyue is a shadow?

128
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,420
Who?

129
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,540
Is there such a thing as side effects?

130
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,100
No.

131
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,140
Yes, I...

132
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,940
What?

133
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,700
I...

134
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,220
When we are together,

135
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,340
we can see every single thing.

136
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,980
And how would you be tired of her?

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,460
By her side,

138
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,340
I would die.

139
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,300
from someone so expensive?

140
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,980
prototyping

141
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,180
something

142
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,700
tell me

143
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,500
what is it about

144
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,140
you

145
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,700
Do you take me by surprise?

146
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,740
yes

147
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,660
then

148
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,700
how long is this

149
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Baby

150
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,300
I don't know

151
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,940
take me

152
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,260
where does the snake !!

153
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,260
It is alive

154
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,180
I said

155
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,180
I think she's the one who's scared.

156
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,180
You...

157
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,780
Are you scared?

158
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,380
Alright.

159
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,380
Let's get down to business.

160
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,380
Get up.

161
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
You said you saw the leader

162
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,380
go to the abandoned house in the suburbs at midnight

163
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,580
to pay respects to the deceased.

164
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,380
I also heard him talking about

165
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,380
the shadow of the moon and the clouds.

166
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
He also brought this.

167
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,380
I think he's the one who's scared.

168
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,580
The Wanderer's Abyss?

169
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,380
My Lord.

170
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,780
When I was checking the files,

171
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,780
I found some problems.

172
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,580
Normally, the records of cases

173
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
will be the origin of the case

174
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
and the motive of the murder.

175
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,980
The cause of the deceased's death

176
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,180
are all recorded clearly.

177
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,580
But none of these files are written.

178
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,780
It's just a simple explanation of the deceased.

179
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,180
That is, the previous leader

180
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,180
was the dead of the God of Diao.

181
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
The blood book of the deceased

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,380
admitted that he was the murderer

183
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,980
of Yun Zhe Yue.

184
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,580
After the death of the leader of the Spring and Autumn Class,

185
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,380
the class was scattered.

186
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,380
It was at that time

187
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,980
that the new leader bought the class.

188
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,380
He acquired all their plays.

189
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,380
After that, he went to school everywhere.

190
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,180
But he never returned to Yangzhou.

191
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,180
The first box

192
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,380
is the famous work of the Spring and Autumn Class.

193
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,380
After he acquired the class,

194
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,380
he never opened the shop.

195
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,580
A businessman

196
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,180
will never do a loss-making business.

197
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,780
What a coincidence!

198
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,180
They didn't come back for long.

199
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,780
Zhou Xian Yi died.

200
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,380
It can't be.

201
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,780
Is it really the soul that never leaves?

202
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,180
If there is really a ghost,

203
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,580
we can't find Zhou Xian Yi.

204
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,780
Come with me to the Romance House.

205
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,180
Yes.

206
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,180
The dead must be here.

207
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,580
Take it away.

208
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,580
The Romance House

209
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,780
Sir,

210
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,580
are we really going in?

211
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,380
I'm afraid.

212
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,380
I didn't know before.

213
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Then I knew

214
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
that since the Spring and Autumn Class was scattered,

215
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
it was abandoned.

216
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,380
I also heard that

217
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,180
many people came into this garden

218
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,180
and saw...

219
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,580
some dirty things.

220
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,780
They couldn't get out.

221
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,780
When they found out,

222
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,580
they had to take off their clothes.

223
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,980
Later, this place couldn't be sold.

224
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,380
It even became a ghost place in Yangzhou.

225
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,180
Then you

226
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,580
shouldn't come out now.

227
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,980
Some things are suspicious.

228
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
After Yun Zhe Yue died,

229
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,780
he didn't bury it in the cemetery.

230
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,980
He buried it here.

231
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,580
I want to know

232
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,380
the connection between him and Zhou Xian Yi.

233
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,180
The autopsy must be done.

234
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,180
Let's go.

235
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,980
It's not good to follow a lunatic.

236
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,380
Sir.

237
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,780
The class leader was worshiped here yesterday.

238
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:13,980
With the

239
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,000
Let go.

240
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,480
Stop turning yourself away.

241
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,400
I don't know that either.

242
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,020
Liang Yu was always planning on making privileges for the State attention for her Net Trap Marc boundary.

243
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,380
Looking at the people,

244
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,720
I hope Pan Xiao as well.

245
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,600
So,

246
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,040
You and the others we did hide the missing Personnel in Ahhh!

247
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,820
That is so lonely.

248
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,880
I understand.

249
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,000
Can he still do this?

250
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:10,880
Yun Zhe Yue's

251
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
He was born with a strong spirit and was born as a human.

252
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
That's why he's called Yun Zhe Yue.

253
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
What does this have to do with me?

254
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
It's said that Yun Zhe Yue raised a little ghost.

255
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Raised a little ghost?

256
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Sir, don't believe it.

257
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
I heard that there are five corpses in Xian Luo.

258
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
They're all the same body.

259
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
They practiced their bodies to make oil

260
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
and then put it in the container they prepared.

261
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
You put in some gold and sell it.

262
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
The container has five doors and eight doors.

263
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
This doll is one of them.

264
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
And I also heard that

265
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
they can help people to transfer to another place.

266
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
But if they're not careful,

267
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
they'll be turned against by the little ghost.

268
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
The ghost god can't believe it.

269
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Then how to explain it?

270
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
He suddenly sang a song in such a short time.

271
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Isn't this doll the best way to explain it?

272
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Behind this room should be the theater.

273
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Sir, don't be afraid.

274
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
That theater is the scene of the case.

275
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
If we go there,

276
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
we can't say anything bad will happen.

277
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
I also met a bloodless one.

278
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
I also met a bloodless one.

279
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
I also met a bloodless one.

280
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I also met a bloodless one.

281
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I also met a bloodless one.

282
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
I also met a bloodless one.

283
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I also met a bloodless one.

284
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
I also met a bloodless one.

285
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
I also met a bloodless one.

286
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
I also met a bloodless one.

287
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I also met a bloodless one.

288
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I also met a bloodless one.

289
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I also met a bloodless one.

290
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
I also met a bloodless one.

291
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
I also met a bloodless one.

292
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Sir, let's go!

293
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
It's way too scary!

294
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Changhhh, Qiiiiii

295
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Great.

296
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Great.

297
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Great.

298
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Great.

299
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Great.

300
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Great.

301
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Great.

302
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Chang...

303
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Qi...

304
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Qing...

305
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Qing...

306
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Dong...

307
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Han...

308
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Han...

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Sir, did you see that?

310
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Great.

311
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
This...

312
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Quiet.

313
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Watch the play.

314
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Han...

315
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Qing...

316
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Qing...

317
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Great.

318
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Great.

319
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
The first song is the best one I've ever heard.

320
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
So this is it.

321
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Great.

322
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
The first song.

323
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Then that person...

324
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
A murder case like Chunxi's a few years ago.

325
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
The victim is this kind of person.

326
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Without Yun Zheyue, how can he be the king?

327
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
It's Yun Zheyue.

328
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Could it be that he's really a ghost?

329
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I can see some dirty things.

330
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
What's going on?

331
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
What's going on?

332
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Boss Yun.

333
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Boss Yun.

334
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Boss Yun.

335
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Boss Yun.

336
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Boss Yun.

337
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Boss Yun.

338
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Yun Zheyue.

339
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Yun Zheyue.

340
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Sir.

341
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
He's dead.

342
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
If he's really Yun Zheyue,

343
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
he must have lost his life.

344
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
No.

345
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
He just died.

346
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Look at my hand.

347
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
And he...

348
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Where's the blood?

349
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Sir, we're really ghosted.

350
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
We can't stay here for long.

351
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Let's go.

352
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
This...

353
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Where is this?

354
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
This is...

355
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
This is...

356
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Where is this?

357
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Sir.

358
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Where is this?

359
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Where are we?

360
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Sir.

361
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
We're screwed.

362
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
June's snow.

363
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
It seems like there's a big injustice.

364
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Sir.

365
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
You can't even walk well.

367
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
What else can you do?

368
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Sir, you should believe me now.

369
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
You must have seen a ghost.

370
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
There's no ghost in this world.

371
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
It's just a mental breakdown.

372
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
You don't believe in anything.

373
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Then what do you believe?

374
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I believe in myself.

375
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Sir, you're really confident.

376
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I don't have that much confidence.

377
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I really can't see Yun Zheyue clearly.

378
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Dad.

379
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
It's time to take the medicine.

380
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Dad, I just asked Doctor Shen.

381
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,880
He said your leg was well received.

382
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,880
He also said that we should go to the clinic in a few days.

383
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
He'll give you a check-up.

384
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:53,480
I'm just a small

395
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
How could I have such treatment?

396
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Yes.

397
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Thanks to Mr. Lu's arrangement this time.

398
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Yun.

399
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
You should be careful.

400
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
You should behave well.

401
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
As long as we don't break the agreement.

402
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
He won't make it hard for us.

403
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
His heart is warm.

404
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
There must be a reason for his heart.

405
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,880
When did Jin Yiwei do the loss?

406
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Yes.

407
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Where's Xia?

408
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,420
He went to the

409
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
It's been a day since he came back.

410
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Yes.

411
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
He should be back by this time.

412
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Uncle Yang.

413
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Miss Shangguan.

414
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Xi.

415
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Why are you here?

416
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
What's up?

417
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Master knows that you have a leg bone fracture.

418
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,880
He said you were not comfortable in the station.

419
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
He asked me to take you back to the gang to rest.

420
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
I'm a rough man.

421
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm not used to being taken care of every day.

422
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Go back and tell Master Xie.

423
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
I appreciate his kindness.

424
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Uncle Yang.

425
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
No need to rush to answer.

426
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
You can think about it.

427
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
This.

428
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
This is the soup I made for you.

429
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
You try it.

430
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Thank you, Xi.

431
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
You're welcome.

432
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Delicious.

433
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm sweating.

434
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Uncle Yang.

435
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I won't bother you.

436
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
I'm leaving.

437
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Dad.

438
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
I'll see Miss Shangguan off.

439
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Okay.

440
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
You see Xi off.

441
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Okay.

442
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Take care.

443
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
I'll be right back.

444
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Okay.

445
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
About the things in the gang.

446
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Please think about it.

447
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
I'll tell my brother.

448
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Just send it here.

449
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Miss Shangguan.

450
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
What?

451
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Anything else?

452
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Zhou Xianyi's case.

453
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
The government suspects that it has something to do with you.

454
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
That one hundred thousand bribe.

455
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
It's related to the safety of the people of Yangzhou.

456
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
So if you really took it away.

457
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
I don't care what you're doing.

458
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I hope you can turn around.

459
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
After all, those people are innocent.

460
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
You're innocent.

461
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
You're not suspecting me.

462
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
You're just making me a criminal.

463
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
I...

464
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Believe it or not.

465
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
I didn't take the money.

466
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
I didn't kill the person.

467
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
I...

468
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Stupid.

469
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
No way.

470
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
That book again.

471
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Is this a ghost eye?

472
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I can't walk anymore.

473
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Take a break.

474
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Why is it so good?

475
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
It's so cold.

476
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
We won't die here, right?

477
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Sir.

478
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
If I die because of the credit.

479
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Remember to give my mother the money to make up for it.

480
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
And...

481
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
If I die because of the credit.

482
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
I'll die.

483
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I'll die.

484
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
You're good at talking.

485
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
To be honest.

486
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,880
You're not half annoying.

487
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
You have a bad temper.

488
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
You're arrogant.

489
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
You're stubborn.

490
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
If you don't change your temper.

491
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,880
No girl will like you in the future.

492
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
But...

493
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm happy to work with you.

494
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,880
I was the first one to run out when I met something in Lushan Gate.

495
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,880
But now you're with me.

496
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,880
I feel so relieved when I feel the world is falling down.

497
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
You mean...

498
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,880
You mean you can be lazy when you're with me, right?

499
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Although you always order me.

500
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,880
But I feel much more relaxed when I work with you.

501
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I...

502
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Yuan Bukui.

503
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Yuan Bukui.

504
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Yuan Bukui.

505
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Yuan Bukui.

506
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Yuan Bukui.

507
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
It's so cold.

508
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Why is my clothes still so dirty after a long time?

509
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
This snow.

510
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Yuan Bukui.

511
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Yuan Bukui.

512
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Wake up.

513
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Yuan Bukui.

514
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,880
I'm afraid I'm in the netherworld.

515
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
You want to die.

516
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I'm afraid Lord Yan doesn't want to accept you.

517
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
I was wrong.

518
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
The secret is out.

519
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I didn't hear anything wrong.

520
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm sorry.

521
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm sorry.

522
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm sorry.

523
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm sorry.

524
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm sorry.

527
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
I'm sorry.

528
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
I'm sorry.

529
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm sorry.

530
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm sorry.

531
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Do as I say.

532
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Why are we back here?

533
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Weren't we in the netherworld just now?

534
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
We've been here all the time.

535
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
We've never left.

536
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
How come?

537
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
That feeling was so real.

538
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
I was almost...

539
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
It's probably the reason for the wind chimes.

540
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
It will make people hallucinate.

541
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Every time you enter a room,

542
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
the wind chimes will ring.

543
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
It's just that the sound is very loud.

544
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
It's not easy to cause people to notice.

545
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,880
It will make people hallucinate unconsciously.

546
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Hallucination?

547
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,880
It's the first time I've seen such a sophisticated way to hallucinate.

548
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,880
It's definitely not easy to make people hallucinate.

549
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Hallucination?

550
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Sir, let's just go.

551
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Let's go.

552
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Let's go.

553
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Leave this place.

554
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Don't stay here.

555
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
It's too scary.

556
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Let's go.

557
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Let's go.

558
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Hurry.

559
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Sir, let's just go.

560
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
Leave this place.

561
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
It's too scary.

562
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Without Yun Zhe Yue,

563
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
how can there be Hallucination?

564
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
After Yun Zhe Yue died,

565
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
he didn't have the purpose of being buried here.

566
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
He just buried him here.

567
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
Don't worry.

568
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
This is the master's memorial tablet.

569
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
We still have things to complete.

570
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
I almost lost my life.

571
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I'm so scared.

572
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
I'm scared.

573
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
I'm scared.

574
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
I almost lost my life.

575
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
I don't care.

576
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Sir, you don't go.

577
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Then I'll go.

578
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Sir.

579
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Sir, be careful.

580
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Sir.

581
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Sir.

582
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
The murderer is really the...

583
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Sir.

584
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Sir.

585
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Sir.

586
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Sir, don't scare me.

587
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Hurry.

588
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
What are you doing here?

589
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
Sir, there's a ghost.

590
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
He was still here just now.

591
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
Can you stop being suspicious all day?

592
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
No, I really saw it.

593
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Where did you go just now?

594
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
To get the evidence.

595
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Where else can I go?

596
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
I saw the ghost.

597
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Where else can I go?

598
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm still very happy to work with you.

599
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Now I feel like the sky is falling down.

600
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Someone is coming to help me.

601
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Take it.

603
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Later, find someone to bury the body.

604
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
I'm not coming.

605
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
I'm not coming.

606
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
If you don't come, I'll come.

607
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm not coming either.

608
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
It's you.

609
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
It's so scary.

610
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
It's not scary.

611
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
No.

612
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Why do you think it's not scary?

613
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Let me help you with the tea.

614
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Minister.

615
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
What should we do?

616
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
His Majesty went all mad.

617
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Now the Ministry of作弊 wants to get the tr acht back.

618
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Otherwise, I wasn'tар.

619
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
Isn't it not the time yet?

620
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,480
But the whereabouts of this divorce contract...

621
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
What are you worrying about?

622
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,960
Since it can guarantee you the position of Minister of Works

623
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,960
it can also guarantee you that you are safe and sound this time.

624
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,160
Besides, I am also a member of the Ministry of Works.

625
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,760
How could I put myself in danger?

626
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm worried that His Majesty will blame me.

627
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
He will drag me into trouble.

628
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,640
You can go back and wait for the transfer of the divorce contract.

629
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
I'll take my leave then.

630
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,840
Find Qiorsan's correct주는

631
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,360
Who made someone hallucinate by using the soul-and-mind tricks in your Chang Lynn?

632
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,280
Why did he need this?

633
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,680
By now, beef with Sang Zhen is determined

634
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,960
the killer who tried to kill being Joł Nancy and Zhou Xianyi is the same person.

635
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,200
But what have they got to do with it?

636
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Why did you kill them?

637
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,720
This is the last time

638
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,080
I sing the first part for you.

639
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,440
Maybe this note

640
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,280
can explain Yun Zheyue's death.

641
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,920
Sing for him?

642
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,960
Could it be...

643
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,880
Didn't you say

644
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,840
such a big change

645
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,040
happened in such a short time?

646
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,320
Is it strange?

647
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,200
If he's looking for a replacement,

648
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,640
it's all clear.

649
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,520
So it's not a little ghost.

650
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,200
It's someone else's voice.

651
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,320
What did I see

652
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,960
in that little ghost?

653
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,400
What little ghost?

654
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,320
Nothing.

655
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,640
Sir,

656
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,920
is the murderer you're guessing

657
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
the same as me?

658
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,560
Go check it.

659
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,680
Yes.

660
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,720
Feier truly doesn't know

661
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,040
that she will die the same day.

662
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,000
Perhaps the murderer

663
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,840
knows that Mr. Jade

664
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,840
will die

665
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,560
the same day in another death.

666
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,840
Mr. Jade,

667
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,000
how about you?

668
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,320
Mr. Jade,

669
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,960
you don't know

670
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
that Mr. Jade

671
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
killed someone?

672
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,040
No one knew happy days

673
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Tell them I have returned to the palace for once.

674
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,280
I tried to discuss and make their manipulating having invited disciples in,

675
00:38:47,520 --> 00:39:05,600
also helped put down Hurry and nove is named as inconvenient

676
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,920
Such a misunderstanding

677
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,080
Be Stephens'.

678
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,880
What~~~

679
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,080
in fact,

680
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,160
look carefully,

681
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,840
preserved even after the blood markers not spotted.

682
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,720
Look carefully!

683
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,200
No!

684
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,360
Doesn't it say

685
00:39:50,360 --> 00:40:10,740
手 With some

686
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,460
hands

687
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,320
Hand

688
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,820
Thanks

689
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,420
At once

690
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
The one who was descend

691
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,240
would have come out

692
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,560
alive

693
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,460
when they fell in vanguards

694
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Why thank you, Brother Sha? We are all brothers.

695
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Senior Sister, actually you don't need to give those two boxes of birth steel to Lu Yi.

696
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,460
The first rule set by the chief is to keep the letter.

697
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,460
This is the primary duty of the person in charge of managing the household affairs.

698
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,460
You and my father are both very good at this.

699
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,460
Anyway, I can't beat you.

700
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Brother Sha, your leg injury hasn't healed for two days. Why are you so anxious?

701
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
Why are you so anxious? Are you leaving tonight?

702
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,460
If I don't leave now, I'm afraid I'll get you all involved.

703
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,460
Besides, I heard that Zhou Xianyi's case,

704
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Wu An Gang has been listed as the most suspicious suspect.

705
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,460
If they find out that I'm hiding here,

706
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,460
then it will be harder for you to clear the crime.

707
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,460
I'd better leave early.

708
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Where are you going?

709
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,460
Where there is a fat sheep, I'll go there.

710
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
You know that.

711
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Come.

712
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,460
Please.

713
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
Brother Sha,

714
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,460
thinking about how we robbed those gold and silver treasures from the pirates,

715
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,460
and then gave them to the people,

716
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,460
there are only two words in my heart that can describe it.

717
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,460
That is, to sing.

718
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,460
How about I follow you around the world

719
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,460
and do a hidden and hidden act of being a hero?

720
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,460
No need.

721
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,460
The chief of the old gang is old.

722
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,460
Besides, the Wu An Gang can't always be managed by the chief of the upper level.

723
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
After all, it's a woman.

724
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,460
Men have to be responsible for the heavy burden.

725
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Brother Sha, you're right.

726
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,460
Heavy burden can't be carried by women.

727
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,460
Junior, you...

728
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,460
Senior, I've seen you deal with a lot of things in the gang.

729
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,460
I've thought about it a lot, too.

730
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
So I decided to come back to deal with the help.

731
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,460
That's great.

732
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,460
The chief will be very happy to hear it.

733
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,460
Okay.

734
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,460
I'll look forward to it.

735
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,460
The Wu An Gang can expand its power range under the supervision of the chief of the Xie Gang.

736
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,460
It can take over the whole grassland.

737
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,460
It's a big deal.

738
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
Come, I'll toast you two.

739
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,460
God, look how hard it was for me this time.

740
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,460
I beg you to bless me.

741
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,460
I'll make it through this time and catch the murderer as soon as possible.

742
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,460
I hope I can save enough money to find my real parents as soon as possible.

743
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,460
I'll be able to help you.

744
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,460
I'll be able to help you.

745
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,460
I'll be able to help you.

746
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,460
I'll be able to help you.

747
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,460
I'll be able to help you.

748
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,460
I'll be able to help you.

749
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,460
Instead of praying here,

750
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,460
why don't you think about how to find a substitute?

751
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,460
Sir.

752
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,460
What's wrong?

753
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,460
Did you hear what I just said?

754
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,460
