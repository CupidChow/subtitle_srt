of Handan.

46
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,800
Zhou Xianyi, 28, ZhejiangWuXingOFFICIENT.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,840
After the death of the late Zhou,

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,040
he was found to have stolen the money from the repair shop.

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,320
He was buried in the grave and was taken in the grave.

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,400
Lord Zhou,

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,560
is there any meaning to this?

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,560
Lord Zhou, do you still remember

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
that three years ago,

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
we had a one-sided agreement?

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,600
At that time, Lord Zhou was in the Ministry of Revenue.

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
He was a high-ranking official.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
Although he was a strict official,

58
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,040
he was quiet and unspoken.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,320
He didn't have any eye for it.

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,480
But he left me a deep impression.

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,280
Lord Liu, what's your opinion on this matter?

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
This matter...

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,040
Lord Yu.

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
Lord Yu.

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,600
Lord Liu.

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
This matter is not going to be solved today.

67
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,800
Lord Huang, please sit down.

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,680
It's great.

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,600
It's great.

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,320
It's great.

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,920
Yes.

72
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,880
I remember Lord Zhou

73
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,880
because of a pair of boots.

74
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,480
The winter is cold and the moon is bright.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,400
The snow is thick.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
The official wore

77
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
not a pair of leather boots,

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,480
but a pair of sheep's boots.

79
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,760
I don't remember

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,400
that it was a pair of boots.

81
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,880
What Lord Zhou wore

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,240
was a pair of old leather boots.

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
I guess

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,880
there was a lot of blood in it.

85
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
It's a matter of the public

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
to know whether the official is poor or not.

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,680
But most officials

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
have their own ways

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,320
to get more money.

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,200
It's really hard to find someone

91
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,080
who can be poor like Lord Zhou.

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,400
You are Lu Yi, Lu Jingli.

93
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,680
Lord Zhou, do you remember

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,920
that I was ordered by His Majesty

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
to investigate the case of the repair of the money and corruption.

96
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,400
If Lord Zhou has any grievances,

97
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
it's okay to tell him.

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Do you believe me?

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,400
I only believe my eyes.

100
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,440
Your eyes may not be real.

101
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
I did use the repair money.

102
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
You admit it.

103
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,040
Where are the official money?

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,760
If I say

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,600
I only took 10,000 official money

106
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
and gave them all back,

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
as for the whereabouts of the lost official money,

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
I don't know.

109
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,240
Lord Lu, do you believe me?

110
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
That day, I deliberately took people away

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
and sneaked into the bank.

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
But later,

113
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
because of some reasons,

114
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,560
I didn't use the 10,000 official money.

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
I went back to the bank

116
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,360
and let go of the official money.

117
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
At that time,

118
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,760
all the official money was still there.

119
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm sure that

120
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,760
all the official money was still there.

121
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Who knew

122
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,160
when Lord Lu gave the order,

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,960
all the official money was gone.

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,760
Why did you use the 10,000 official money?

125
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,560
It's a serious matter.

126
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
I

127
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
I

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
have my own difficulties.

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,960
I hope you can understand.

130
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,760
Since you know the relationship is serious,

131
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
you should tell us.

132
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,760
So that we can help you clear your name.

133
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,160
Now, both the witness and the witness are here.

134
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,160
It's hard to judge

135
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
by your face.

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
It's said that the Imperial Guards are cruel.

137
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,560
The punishment in the imperial prison is more complicated.

138
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
Lu Jingli must have listened to me

139
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,760
and didn't beat him severely.

140
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm already very grateful.

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,960
It's just a rumor.

142
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Our Imperial Guards are not brainless.

143
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
When should we release them?

144
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
When should we punish them?

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,360
We know it well.

146
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
Maybe Lord Zhou's difficulty

147
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
is the key to our case.

148
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
Sir, do you believe what Zhou Xianyi said?

149
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Do you believe it?

150
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,760
There are too many people who are shameless and heartless.

151
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
So I only believe the evidence.

152
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,760
Yuan Bukai is a smart person.

153
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,760
The bank of Yangzhou is not far from here.

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Let's go and have a look.

155
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,160
Okay.

156
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,560
Sir, the footprints are a bit complicated.

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
There are many people who are here, but they are all officials.

158
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
If all the officials are here,

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,960
is Zhou Xianyi telling the truth?

160
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,960
Think about it.

161
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,960
If the 100,000 taels of silver is really what Zhou Xianyi is talking about,

162
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,160
it's not good to waste time and effort

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
just because he is the only one who is here.

164
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,760
He admitted

165
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
that he stole the 100,000 taels of silver.

166
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,560
That means

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,960
he has the ability to transfer the silver secretly.

168
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,360
If you want to know if he is telling the truth,

169
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
you have to figure out

170
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
why he stole the 100,000 taels of silver.

171
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,960
Let's go.

172
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,360
Where are we going now?

173
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,160
I'm hungry.

174
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Let's eat something.

175
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Wait for me, sir.

176
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,960
Sir, wait for me.

177
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,560
Sir,

178
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,560
do you usually eat so simply?

179
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,560
Eating is just filling your stomach.

180
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,960
Is there any problem?

181
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,160
No.

182
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm just thinking that

183
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,760
you high-ranking officials must pay attention to your meals.

184
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,960
Do you usually eat such small restaurants?

185
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,760
It's not necessarily delicious.

186
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,160
It's not necessarily delicious.

187
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Here comes the noodles.

188
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,560
Yangzhou shrimp dumplings.

189
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Enjoy.

190
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
The smaller the stall, the more authentic the taste.

191
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,960
Try it.

192
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
It's the local specialty.

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Okay.

194
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,960
Fresh cabbage.

195
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
One more bowl, please.

196
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,760
Okay.

197
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,360
I've been eating fast since I was a kid.

198
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Sir, don't mind me.

199
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Please enjoy.

200
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,560
I just was afraid that I'd order extra food for your bowl.

201
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Sorry, madam,

202
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
I've ordered everything myself.

203
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
The meal is ready.

204
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
What?

205
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,280
I have to trouble

206
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,080
my works for you by labor.

207
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,720
I'll make them KFC clean.

208
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,760
You'll be fresh if you prepare the dishes.

209
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
It's embarrassing.

210
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
I've added the ingredients in the bowl.

211
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,960
Your tears are falling.

212
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,160
Boss, hurry up.

213
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,360
I'm almost there.

214
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,760
Boss.

215
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,160
Sir, there's still a bowl of noodles left.

216
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,760
Noodles are here.

217
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I'll be right there. I'll eat a few more bites.

218
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
I won't waste any more.

219
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,960
Wait for me.

220
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,560
Okay.

221
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Sir, I've found out that after Zhou Xianyi received 100,000 taels of silver,

222
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,560
it was handed over to Wu Anbang.

223
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
So when the silver was sent to the bank,

224
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
Shang Guanxi and Xie Xiao were there.

225
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,560
Wu Anbang?

226
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
But there's no name on the bank account.

227
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,560
But this money is not appropriate for the people to send it to the bank.

228
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
It seems that Zhou Xianyi is afraid that the money hasn't been sent to Yangzhou yet

229
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,560
and it's already been robbed and locked up.

230
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,560
That's why he asked Wu Anbang to help with the transfer.

231
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
There are so many banners in Yangzhou,

232
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,160
but Zhou Xianyi insisted on sending it to Wu Anbang.

233
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,360
It seems that their relationship is not simple.

234
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
The Money in Yangzhou

235
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,160
You didn't tell me in advance that you were here.

236
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm sorry for not welcoming you.

237
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,160
You're too kind, Master Shang Guan.

238
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,160
I think that you came here for Zhou Xianyi.

239
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,960
Since you asked me so many questions,

240
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,360
I won't be so picky.

241
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,960
That's right. We came here for Zhou Xianyi.

242
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:37,160
It was the Gui Gang that sent the money to the bank in Yangzhou, right?

243
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,160
That's right. It was Bi Gang that sent it.

244
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,160
But the money was sent by the government.

245
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Bi Gang didn't enter the bank alone.

246
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,360
They left the government after they were transferred.

247
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Master Lu, are you suspecting us?

248
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,960
Before we found out about this case,

249
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,960
anyone who had been paid the money was suspicious.

250
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
We sent a lot of money to the bank.

251
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,360
Now the money is lost in the bank.

252
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,960
Are you going to blame us?

253
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Don't worry.

254
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
We're just doing what we're told.

255
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,360
We have to investigate the money one by one.

256
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,960
Where are you two when Zhou Xianyi was arrested?

257
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,760
Can anyone prove it?

258
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,560
When Zhou was arrested,

259
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,960
Xie Xiao and I were at the port of Wu An Gang to collect the goods.

260
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,760
The brothers of Wu An Gang can prove it.

261
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,760
Okay.

262
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,960
Since Chief Shangguan can prove his innocence,

263
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
we'll take our leave.

264
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,960
We won't see you off. Please.

265
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Goodbye.

266
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,160
Goodbye.

267
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,360
I told you not to send this money.

268
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,960
Look, you're making trouble.

269
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,360
The Day of the Boundless Love

270
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Did you find anything on Chief Shangguan?

271
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,960
I found that the sachet he had

272
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,360
looked very similar to that of Zhou Xianyi.

273
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,760
Even the scent is the same.

274
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,360
Are you sure?

275
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,160
Just a sachet can't be a proof, right?

276
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
I'm not sure.

277
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,920
Tell me, then.

278
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Is there anything special about this sachet?

279
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,720
These two sachets are really delicate.

280
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,320
They are used for embroidery, embroidery, and carving.

281
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
The most difficult part is the carving.

282
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
It's also the most unique.

283
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,320
The person who made this sachet must be a female palace maid.

284
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,120
These two sachets are really similar in style and technique.

285
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
I suspect that they are from the same person.

286
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Go and check where this sachet came from.

287
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Okay.

288
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Is this fine?

289
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
It's fine.

290
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
Master, the medicine is ready.

291
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Drink it while it's hot.

292
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Okay.

293
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Father, be careful.

294
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Master, these past few days,

295
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
I've been investigating Zhou Xianyi's case with Sir Lu.

296
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
I couldn't take care of you.

297
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
How are you?

298
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Does your leg still hurt?

299
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
It's been a few days.

300
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
It doesn't hurt anymore.

301
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
You know my personality.

302
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Even if it hurts, I won't be able to take care of you.

303
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,080
By the way, how's Zhou Xianyi's case?

304
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,080
Zhou Xianyi insists that he doesn't know the whereabouts of the 100,000 taels of silver.

305
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,080
I suspect that this has something to do with the Wu An Gang.

306
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Wu An Gang?

307
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
What are the suspicious points?

308
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Sha Xiu, Zhulian, and Xie Xiao

309
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
stole the birthday cake of the State of Zheng's Central Guards.

310
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,080
It's clear that they are familiar with the stolen official's belongings.

311
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Moreover, the person who sent this batch of silver is from Wu An Gang.

312
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,040
It's not that they are greedy for the silver.

313
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
I also found an important point.

314
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Zhou Xianyi's sachet and Shang Guanxi's sachet

315
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
are from the same person.

316
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
You mean that

317
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,040
there's a possibility that Zhou Xianyi and Shang Guanxi

318
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
have some kind of collusion?

319
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Not necessarily.

320
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
This is just my speculation.

321
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I have no evidence.

322
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
But, Master,

323
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
you and Chief Xie are very close.

324
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
If it's really from Wu An Gang,

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Master, you...

326
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Don't worry about me.

327
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You can investigate this case as you like.

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If it's really from Wu An Gang,

329
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I won't let you handle it.

330
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
With you here, I know what to do.

331
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Master, your leg really doesn't hurt.

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You don't eat so many snacks here.

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You just look at me like this?

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Have one.

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I know you like me since you were little.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But you don't have to look at me like this.

337
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Tell me honestly.

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Did you take that batch of silver?

339
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yuan Daxia,

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you are too insulting my personality.

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I took those illegal assets of the corrupt officials.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I took them all.

343
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I took those illegal assets of the corrupt officials

344
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
to get rich and to be poor.

345
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
The 100,000 is for the benefit of the people.

346
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
I won't take it no matter how muddled I am.

347
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
You swear?

348
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I swear.

349
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Okay.

350
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Then,

351
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
about the construction of the dam,

352
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
do you owe me a favor?

353
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
I thought it was a big deal.

354
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
It turned out to be a favor.

355
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Tell me.

356
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
How do you want me to pay you back?

357
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
You want to marry me?

358
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I don't object.

359
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I'm not kidding.

360
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I think the relationship between Shangguan and Zhou Xianyi

361
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
is not that simple.

362
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
What do you mean?

363
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
I don't understand.

364
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Shangguan has a sachet

365
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,920
that is exactly the same as that of Zhou Xianyi.

366
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Sachet?

367
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,880
I never take those things.

368
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Do you suspect

369
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
that I have something to do with the theft of official money?

370
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I believe in you.

371
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I will never do such a thing.

372
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
After I interrogated Zhou Xianyi with Mr. Lu,

373
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
I'm sure that the sachet on Zhou Xianyi

374
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,880
is the same as that of Shangguan.

375
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I'll help you find out.

376
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,840
Do you dare to be gentle?

377
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
You...

378
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
There's a hole here.

379
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Could it be a dog hole?

380
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
If I knew it, I would have practiced my martial arts.

381
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Anyway, nobody saw it.

382
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
I'm afraid that I can't find it.

383
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,840
I'll go to find it.

384
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm so scared.

385
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
I'm scared.

386
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm scared.

387
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm scared.

388
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm scared.

389
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
I'm scared.

390
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I'm scared.

391
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Sir, why are you here?

392
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Where do you think I should be?

393
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
How dare I make a guess about your whereabouts?

394
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
You're here.

395
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Come with me to investigate the case.

396
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Sir,

397
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I don't know if I should say it or not.

398
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I think I should say it.

399
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Although I'm a constable,

400
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm also a girl.

401
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
In the middle of the night,

402
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,760
I'm willing to offend you.

403
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,760
But I'm afraid that I'll hurt your reputation.

404
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I'll leave first.

405
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,760
It seems that I have to find Yang to explain it to you.

406
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
I can't take you with me in the investigation.

407
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,760
I'll talk about the compensation later.

408
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
If you don't mind,

409
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm willing to wait for your order.

410
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,760
It's not good to be alone.

411
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Don't hurt my reputation.

412
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Sir, I was just joking.

413
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,720
You're a womanizer for the court.

414
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
You're a man with a good character.

415
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
You're a man who doesn't make trouble.

416
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Others can't say anything.

417
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
You guessed it wrong.

418
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
I'm not a man who doesn't make trouble.

419
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm not like you.

420
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
I'm not interested at all.

421
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Come on.

422
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Sir, we're from the Guan family.

423
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,720
It's not good to break into a famous house.

424
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Then, Yuan Bukai,

425
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
why are you in the dog hole

426
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,720
in the private house in the middle of the night?

427
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Then...

428
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Are you not good at making a contribution?

429
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
You can't come up.

430
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
No.

431
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
That's not a dog hole.

432
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Thank you, sir.

433
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Actually, I'm good at it.

434
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Yang Chengwan's contribution

435
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,680
was very few in the Imperial Guards.

436
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
I didn't expect his apprentice

437
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
to be so different from him.

438
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Sir, you're wrong.

439
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm not bad at making contributions.

440
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
But this building is a little high.

441
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
I'm so tired.

442
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Sir.

443
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Hurry up.

444
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Go.

445
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Sir, go.

446
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
It's just a cat.

447
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
What's there to be afraid of?

448
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Cat?

449
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Why is the cat here?

450
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Is this cat

451
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
raised by Zhou Xian?

452
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Because he misses his master,

453
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
he keeps staying in the small building.

454
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
I'm so tired.

455
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Let me rest for a while.

456
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
I'll go to rest.

457
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Go.

458
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Let's go.

459
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,640
Hurry up.

460
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Hurry up.

461
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Hurry up.

462
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Hurry up.

463
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Hurry up.

464
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Hurry up.

465
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Hurry up.

466
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Hurry up.

467
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Hurry up.

468
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Hurry up.

469
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
It seems that Zhou Xian

470
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
has a lover in Yangzhou.

471
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Sir.

472
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
This should be the spice.

473
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
There are...

474
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,040
...mustard seeds and cloves.

475
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,240
Go over there and take a look.

476
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,640
Sir.

477
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,840
Look.

478
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,640
This Zhou Xianyi is still a foodie.

479
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,640
What do you mean?

480
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,240
What do you mean?

481
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,440
These are all used to make rouge.

482
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Look.

483
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Wrap the diced and mixed spices in silk cotton

484
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,840
and put them in warm wine.

485
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,440
Soak them for one to three days.

486
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,040
Then pour the wine into the cow's blood.

487
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,840
After the fire is on, put it in the clear wine.

488
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,640
It will make the color of the oil paper white.

489
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Finally, use silk cotton to filter the oil paper.

490
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,040
Pour it into the bowl to cool it.

491
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
If you put it in the pig's dung,

492
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
it will be red pure paper.

493
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,840
If you don't put it in the pig's dung, it will be fine.

494
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,240
It will be a smooth surface paper.

495
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,440
You know a lot.

496
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
This is a prescription written in the book of the Qin Ming medicine.

497
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,440
I have tried it before.

498
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,240
I wanted to make some rouge and sell it.

499
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,240
But the price is too high and I can't call for a price.

500
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
I have to do it.

501
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,840
It's a lot of work to make some money.

502
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
Go to the wardrobe over there and take a look.

503
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Is there any clue?

504
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,840
Senior Sister, it's been a long time since we drank together.

505
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,040
We have to drink well today.

506
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,440
Okay.

507
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,840
Come.

508
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,240
Come.

509
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Do you remember the night you left three years ago?

510
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,240
You have been taking care of Wu An Gang for the past three years.

511
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,040
You have worked hard.

512
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,440
It's not hard.

513
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,040
As long as I see you come back, it's worth it.

514
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,840
Senior Sister, you never brought anything from a girl's house.

515
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,640
Why did you learn to bring it?

516
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Are you talking about this?

517
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Lan Ye gave me this.

518
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Lan Ye? Who is Lan Ye?

519
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,440
Zhai Lan Ye.

520
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,040
After you left three years ago, I found out about him on the Shou Xi Lake.

521
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,240
He is a man with a sad fate.

522
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,040
If Lan Ye hadn't persuaded me,

523
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,240
I wouldn't have known how to become a big and small figure of Wu An Gang.

524
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,840
Senior Sister, you have worked hard. I'll give you a toast.

525
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,640
Sir.

526
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,840
I'm here to see you.

527
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Sir, look.

528
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,840
The official uniform is broken.

529
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,640
It seems that Zhou Xian Yi's salary

530
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,240
is used to buy the rouge material.

531
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Making rouge is a very common process.

532
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,640
But he still has to do it himself.

533
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,840
He is really hard-working.

534
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,240
Sir, do you think his lover

535
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,240
is the one who made the sachet?

536
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,440
It's very possible.

537
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,840
How is the sachet I asked you to check on Guan Xi?

538
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,240
Sir, don't worry. I'm already checking.

539
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,440
I'll know in a few days.

540
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Episode 2

541
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,440
Sir, is there a ghost in this house?

542
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,240
Why is it so windy when I come out?

543
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,840
I'm sorry, Sir.

544
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,040
I didn't mean to. I must...

545
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,440
Don't touch it.

546
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Isn't it just a broken bracelet?

547
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,440
Is it worth it?

548
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,440
Zhai Lan Ye.

549
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Isn't that sachet a broken bracelet?

550
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
It's not a broken bracelet.

551
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Zhai Lan Ye?

552
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,040
Isn't that sachet a token of love that Sister Shang Guan made for Zhou Xian Yi?

553
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,040
No. Sister never does the work of a woman.

554
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,640
Then what about Zhai Lan Ye?

555
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,240
She is Sister's best friend.

556
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,240
She used to live in the house in the east of Yangzhou.

557
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,840
I heard that she moved out recently.

558
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,040
I don't know where she went.

559
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,640
I told you already.

560
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,040
Sister will never do such a thing.

561
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,640
Then according to what you said,

562
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,440
the person who has a special relationship with Zhou Xian Yi is not Sister Shang Guan.

563
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
It's Zhai Lan Ye.

564
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Where can we find her?

565
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,640
On the boat.

566
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,640
She is Yangzhou's horse-bearing woman.

567
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,040
I heard about it.

568
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,440
That is another kind of human-bearing business in Yangzhou.

569
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,640
The famous horse-bearing woman in Meixi is the daughter of a poor family.

570
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,840
When she reaches the age of seven or eight, she will be adopted by her mother.

571
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,440
Then she will learn how to play chess and calligraphy and cook.

572
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,040
And all the teachings they teach are about how to become a concubine.

573
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,640
Anyway, I don't like this kind of thing.

574
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,040
I also heard that this kind of horse-bearing woman is smart and smart.

575
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,440
If a smart person is a smart person,

576
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,640
the Yang family will teach her to play the zither, play the zither, write, and draw.

577
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,440
Play the zither, play the zither, play the zither, and play the double-decker.

578
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,840
In terms of memory, besides teaching them how to dress up and make a good fortune,

579
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,640
there are even more clever people who will let them follow the map of Ruyi Army.

580
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,440
Learn how to play the zither.

581
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,240
Don't you like it?

582
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,640
Hey, Yuan Da Xia.

583
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
You actually know so much.

584
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,440
Of course. Ruyi Army wants to have a whole trip there.

585
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,040
Huh?

586
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
You actually like this?

587
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,440
That is for the case of Xiao Ye.

588
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,640
It's fine if it's for the case. You don't have to hit me.

589
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
What else do you want to ask?

590
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,440
It seems that you know quite a lot.

591
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Say it. What else is related to Zhai Lanye?

592
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,640
You only asked me about the sachet, not about Zhai Lanye.

593
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,240
I...

594
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,040
No, no. Yuan Jin Xia, why do you always hit people?

595
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
Didn't I already tell you that a man's head can't be hit?

596
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,240
Xiao Ye doesn't have that much patience. Say it.

597
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,640
Say it.

598
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,840
Why are you so anxious?

599
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Senior Sister said that

600
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,240
a few months ago, Zhai Lanye met Zhou Xianyi in the lake of Fanzhou.

601
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,640
She played the zither, two cups of egg tea, and chatted for a few words.

602
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,840
She then led Zhou Xianyi to be his girlfriend.

603
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,840
If Zhou Xianyi is so obsessed with her, why didn't she just marry her?

604
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Zhai Lanye is a good man.

605
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,440
If you want to marry her, you must add 10,000 taels of silver to the Yang family.

606
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,640
If you want Zhou Xianyi to bring out so much money, how can she bring it out?

607
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,840
If I say that I only brought 10,000 taels of silver and gave them all back.

608
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,440
So that's how it is.

609
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Zhou Xianyi admitted that he used 10,000 taels of silver,

610
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,840
but he just wouldn't tell me about that.

611
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,040
I already told you so much.

612
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,840
How can you answer...

613
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,840
If you dare to touch me again, I'll beat you up!

614
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,840
When you've thought of how to thank me, come find me. I'm leaving.

615
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,440
Hey!

616
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,440
Sir!

617
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Why did you come in to knock?

618
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,840
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were changing clothes.

619
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,840
I just have something important to report.

620
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,440
What is it?

621
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Sir, I've already found out why Zhou Xianyi used that 10,000 taels of silver.

622
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,640
He's doing it for a horse.

623
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Horse?

624
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,440
His name is Zhai Lanye. A few months ago, Zhou Xianyi fell in love with him.

625
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,440
But if he wants to marry him, he has to give the Yang family 10,000 taels of silver.

626
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,640
Zhou Xianyi is very diligent.

627
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,240
He even sold his hometown to raise money.

628
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,440
Looks like he's still a hero who can't beat the beauty.

629
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,440
As far as I know, as long as the weather is good,

630
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Zhai Lanye will take him to the lake to get married.

631
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Arrange a boat for me.

632
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,040
Send out the news that I'm going to the lake.

633
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,440
Tell them that it's a noble gentleman from the capital.

634
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,240
Do you know what to do?

635
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,040
I've already thought of a way to get married.

636
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,240
Tomorrow, come with Yang Yue.

637
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Yes.

638
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,440
Sir Lu, but...

639
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,840
What is it?

640
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,040
The boat needs money.

641
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,840
But my hands are weak.

642
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Can you give me some money?

643
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,240
When this is over, we'll take it together.

644
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,840
How can I make a boat without money?

645
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,440
With your ability, it's not easy to get some money.

646
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,240
Thank you for your compliment. Goodbye.

647
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,320
It's time for you to go.

648
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,440
OK, goodbye.

649
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,440
God, goodbye.

650
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,840
Xia Yan, your dziocy is so cute.

651
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,320
Why can't I be happy to hear that?

652
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,280
Are you praising me?

653
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,680
Were you praising me just now?

654
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,280
I...

655
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,200
Yes.

656
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,960
Yes?

657
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,040
Am I happy?

658
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,880
I'm so happy!

659
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay, okay.

660
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,800
What's wrong with you?

661
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,720
Here?

662
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,040
You don't understand.

663
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,920
This is called disguise.

664
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,240
Otherwise, with my appearance,

665
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
I won't look like a servant

666
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,920
if I don't wear any makeup.

667
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,120
It's like...

668
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
Your hair is like this.

669
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,760
You're talking nonsense!

670
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
You're talking nonsense!

671
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,840
Xiao Qiao,

672
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,120
I'm telling you, you're getting more and more annoying.

673
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,680
I...

674
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,800
You're so annoying!

675
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,720
Are you done?

676
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,400
I'm telling you.

677
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,720
Drink.

678
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,120
I'll go.

679
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,840
Go.

680
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,160
Please enjoy.

681
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,040
Officer Yuan,

682
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,240
you have to look like a servant

683
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,880
even if you're a maid.

684
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,480
If you act like this,

685
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,480
you'll be easily caught.

686
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
Please enjoy, sir.

687
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,360
Sir, is this okay?

688
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,680
It's normal.

689
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,160
Your complexion

690
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,840
is really...

691
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,920
My complexion

692
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,400
is a little bit worse.

693
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,840
But it's for the case.

694
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,080
Please take it.

695
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,160
It's useless.

696
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,320
Just be happy.

697
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,320
I wonder if Zha Lanyan

698
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,200
will come out to play on the lake next day.

699
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,360
If he doesn't come out,

700
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,440
the money will be wasted.

701
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,240
But eat something.

702
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,160
Why don't you eat?

703
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,760
You eat well.

704
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,640
Zha Lanyan's boat seems to have arrived.

705
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,320
What should we do now?

706
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,400
Okay.

707
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,600
It's really him.

708
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,920
I've asked around.

709
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,480
Zha Lanyan is good at playing pipa.

710
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,760
He's here.

711
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,840
Get on the boat.

712
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,600
Okay.

713
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,040
Good.

714
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,680
Who's boat is so heavy?

715
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,840
How can you get on my lady?

716
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,120
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm really sorry.

718
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,840
My master said

719
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,040
he wanted to board the boat

720
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,480
and apologize to your master.

721
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,320
No one can see my lady.

722
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,280
Gui,

723
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,680
don't do this.

724
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,080
Please ask the young master on the boat

725
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,680
to apologize to your master.

726
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,640
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,400
I'm sorry.

729
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,160
I'm sorry.

730
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,960
I'm sorry.

731
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,240
Please ask the young master on the boat

732
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,280
to apologize to your master.

733
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,840
Yes.

734
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,880
Please.

735
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,200
Wait a moment.

736
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,160
My lord,

737
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,360
as you expected,

738
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,960
he agreed so quickly.

739
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,720
You've been in the six mountains for so long.

740
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,360
Think about it.

741
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,080
Does he want to see me more

742
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,640
or I want to see him more?

743
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,160
I can't tell.

744
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,640
What did you say?

745
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,360
My lord, you're wise.

746
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,760
Please, my lord.

747
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,920
Who are you?

748
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,280
How dare he attack my lady?

749
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,040
This is so Jackson to be flattered.

750
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,040
He fled after checking up on a foreign guest.

751
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:46,960
Come now.

752
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,520
Morning.

753
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,320
Please come in.

754
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,940
Welcome.

755
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,800
Thank you for wandering around.

756
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,800
I'm fine. Thank you for your concern.

757
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I'm new to Yangzhou.

758
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I'm here to watch the scenery of Shouxi Lake.

759
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I heard the sound of the moon on your boat.

760
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
I'm so eager to know it.

761
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I like to play instruments.

762
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
I'm sorry for your embarrassment.

763
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
I wonder if we're lucky enough

764
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
to hear you play a song.

765
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
You're a guest.

766
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm embarrassed.

767
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I'm sorry.

768
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
The sound of the boat's whistle.

769
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
The heart is blank.

770
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
A thousand miles of ambush.

771
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Who is out there?

772
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,800
It's better than fate.

773
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,800
I can see your face when I close my eyes.

774
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Open your eyes and see the cold scenery.

775
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
The sword is full of sky.

776
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Who has conquered the world?

777
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
No sound.

778
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
The sound of the boat's whistle.

779
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,800
The fate is changing.

780
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
It's a change of heart.

781
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I want to say goodbye.

782
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,800
It's too sad to say goodbye.

783
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
I miss you.

784
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
I miss you.

785
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
I miss you.

786
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,800
The day I met you.

787
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
I'm fine.

788
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,800
We spent our years together.

789
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,800
I will see you in my dreams.

790
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:29,800
The End
