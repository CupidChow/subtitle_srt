Is it worth it?

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
You don't need to hide from me.

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,840
I have to fulfill some of your wishes.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Other than Shi Ruo,

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
you have no other choice.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Let's drink.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
Okay.

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Let's drink.

59
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Let's drink.

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
This is a matter of fact.

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm not going to drink.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm not going to drink.

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Yan Shi Fan is going to be put in prison.

64
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
He's still so arrogant.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
I think you'd better not come these days.

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
In case of unnecessary trouble.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I understand.

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
I have to hurry up and find that eunuch.

69
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
To save Lan.

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Your Majesty, you're going to sign me?

71
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Not yet.

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I found a person who looks like you.

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Change into his clothes and leave here.

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
We'll talk about other things after we get out of prison.

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,840
This is a crime committed by the Chu family.

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I've arranged it.

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
No one will know.

78
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Find a place to hide.

79
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
From now on,

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
I care about Lan Qing Xuan.

81
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,840
The past experience is not in vain.

82
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
You go.

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
I've made up my mind.

84
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Don't marry me again.

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Lan Qing Xuan.

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Ruyi.

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,840
This is our only chance left.

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,840
I can't have any feelings or feelings.

89
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Lan Qing.

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Otherwise,

91
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,840
the only thing in front of us is the death.

92
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
You go back.

93
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,840
All the efforts are in the hands of Yan Dang.

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
You have to be careful.

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Don't get yourself into trouble again.

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm investigating this matter according to the emperor's order.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,840
So Yan Shi Fen dare not say anything.

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
But you.

99
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,840
The emperor is still angry.

100
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
The officials under the Yan family

101
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
want to sue you.

102
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
If this continues,

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,840
I'm afraid you'll die here before you meet the emperor.

104
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
He Yan Shi Fan.

105
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
He's the one who's been scheming against me.

106
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
He's afraid of death.

107
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
I'll tell the emperor.

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll tell him to do something.

109
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,840
I'll break his easy-to-defeat.

110
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Ruyi.

111
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
You and I both know.

112
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Yan family is in the capital.

113
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
It's hard to keep a big hand.

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,840
It's not easy to get a good foundation.

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Before the first marriage,

116
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
as long as I die in their hands,

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
I can still show respect to the emperor's trust in the Yan family.

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
No.

119
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I arranged you into the palace.

120
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
I can't watch you die.

121
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
I chose my own way.

122
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
You.

123
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Don't come to see me again.

124
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
This time,

125
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Yan Shi Fan will definitely use you and my relationship as a shield.

126
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
The emperor is suspicious.

127
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,840
If he finds out that we're really related,

128
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
he won't let you off easily.

129
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,840
You can't let this go.

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
And...

131
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Keep this letter.

132
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,840
It can make the Yan family lose the emperor's trust in them.

133
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,840
It's the last thing I can do for you.

134
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
The last thing?

135
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
What do you mean?

136
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Put it away.

137
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Sir.

138
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Yan Shi Fan is here.

139
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
It's late.

140
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,840
You're still here.

141
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
You're so diligent.

142
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
You're no longer a court official.

143
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Why are you here?

144
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Aren't you afraid of the emperor's punishment?

145
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Afraid?

146
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
But I'm not a court official.

147
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
What am I afraid of?

148
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Right.

149
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,840
The Yan family is under the protection of the emperor.

150
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
They can do whatever they want.

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
That's good to know.

152
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I heard that you want to exchange the money for food.

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,840
I wonder if it's true.

154
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Did you see it with your own eyes?

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm here to ask for evidence.

156
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
How's it going, Lan Shen Xing?

157
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Can you still hold it?

158
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Yan Shi Fan.

159
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
I'm a lowly man.

160
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
I'm not important.

161
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I must be punished.

162
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Punished?

163
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
What punishment?

164
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Where is it?

165
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Lan Shen Xing.

166
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Today, I can give you a chance.

167
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
As long as you confess.

168
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Who is the master behind you?

169
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,840
I can let you stay alive.

170
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm so disappointed in you.

171
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
How can I let you down?

172
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Disgusting.

173
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Speak.

174
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Who is behind you?

175
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I'm Lan Shen Xing.

176
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm ordered to be punished.

177
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,840
You can ask me ten times.

178
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
I'll be punished.

179
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Punished.

180
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I.

181
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I'mOD

182
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:13,840
summary

183
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Judge Lu, you be the witness.

184
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
He's Palace's Grandsities by a death sentence.

185
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Lan Qingsuan.

186
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
I don't have anything to do with her.

187
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Take it away.

188
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Lan Qingxuan, what are you doing?

189
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
I've been cutting my knife for half of my life.

190
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
It's really a mountain.

191
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Don't be sad.

192
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Go to the waterfall.

193
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Okay.

194
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Don't say anymore.

195
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Don't say anymore.

196
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Don't say anymore.

197
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Zi Fu, Dr. Xiao, hurry up.

198
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Yes.

199
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
I don't need to do this.

200
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
I can't hold on anymore.

201
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,840
In my next life, we can still be brothers.

202
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:22,840
In this life, I can't see a real...

203
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
real... real... real... real...

204
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
You have to cherish it.

205
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,840
I want to be with you.

206
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I want to be with you.

207
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Lan Qingxuan.

208
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Lan Qingxuan.

209
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Lan Qingxuan.

210
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Lan Qingxuan.

211
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Lan Qingxuan.

212
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Stop.

213
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Who are you?

214
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
What do you want?

215
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
What do we want?

216
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
You're a dead eunuch.

217
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
You made us squat for so many days.

218
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Don't worry.

219
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
We're not from Yan Shi Fan.

220
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Liushan Gate.

221
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Young Master, what should we do?

222
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Get lost.

223
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Get lost.

224
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Yes.

225
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Lan Qingxuan.

226
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
You're really a good person.

227
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Come on.

228
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Give me this.

229
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Sir Lu.

230
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Sir Lu, I found that eunuch.

231
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
He admitted to being ordered to frame Lan Qingxuan.

232
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Qingxia, Lan Qingxuan...

233
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
What happened to him?

234
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Yesterday, Yan Shi Fan forced me to ask who the mastermind behind Lan Zhenren in the prison.

235
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Lan Zhenren suddenly grabbed Yan Shi Fan's knife and died.

236
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Sir didn't stop him.

237
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Please.

238
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Lan,

239
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
you should blame us for not finding that eunuch earlier.

240
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,440
Miss Yuan, you're smart and smart.

241
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,920
Lan Lan.

242
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,400
Lan.

243
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,560
You're as funny as before.

244
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
You're still funny even though you haven't seen each other for a day.

245
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,920
Miss Yuan, happiness

246
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
should be held by yourself sometimes.

247
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,040
Come on, don't drink alone.

248
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Let me toast to you.

249
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
May you be happy forever.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,920
Lan Zhenren is dead?

251
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,320
I only asked you to interrogate him.

252
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,760
I didn't ask you to kill him.

253
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,440
Why did Yan Shifan

254
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,000
go to the prison and force Lan Zhenren?

255
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,160
Your Majesty, I don't know.

256
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
When I arrived,

257
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,760
Lan Zhenren was the last one left.

258
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,600
Besides, after my search,

259
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
in the city,

260
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,800
I caught the man who ordered Lan Zhenren.

261
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
The eunuch.

262
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,360
This is the eunuch's testimony.

263
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,240
Please read it.

264
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,200
Good.

265
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
Good for you, Yan Shifan.

266
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,680
You even dared to drag my people in.

267
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,840
I'm so ashamed to see Yan Song

268
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,040
being so kind to him.

269
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,840
But he

270
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,000
is so spoiled and ungrateful.

271
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,040
Lu Qianchi.

272
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,440
You should join the Three Judicial Offices to investigate this case.

274
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,440
Lock Yan Shifan up in the house.

275
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
Before we find out the truth,

276
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,480
we can't let him go out.

277
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

278
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Go.

279
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,040
Yan Song

280
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,640
is stunned by this.

281
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,280
Don't get the dowry,

282
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,040
and wear the casket back to hometown.

283
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,920
Let him go away.

284
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
I will go without resistance.

285
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,520
Master,

286
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,480
this...

287
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,840
It's enough.

288
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,760
A young man at such a young age

289
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,640
like this

290
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,640
might be in danger.

291
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,000
balled me into quite a big trouble.

292
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Tell me.

293
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Tell me.

294
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,000
Recently, His Majesty found out about Lan Qingquan's death in prison.

295
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,800
I don't know where he got the confession of the eunuch.

296
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,560
His Majesty was so upset when he saw it.

297
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
He even ordered the Three Judicial Offices to investigate the case.

298
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,160
He even ordered to banish you.

299
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,280
Even His Lordship wants to get back to the hometown.

300
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,600
Young Master, what should we do next?

301
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,040
Lu Yi, you're so good.

302
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,280
You want to use Lan Qingquan's death to get involved with me?

303
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,400
Then I'll use Lan Qingquan's death to teach me how to be a good person.

304
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,840
The eunuch and the Taoist priest are colluding.

305
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,960
This crime can't be washed away so easily.

306
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,080
This crime can't be washed away so easily.

307
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,560
Young Master, you're so wise.

308
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,560
Without Lu Ting's protection,

309
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,280
you're just a bird that hasn't been sealed by the rain.

310
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
I'll see how you'll fly in the cage.

311
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I, Yan Song,

312
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
I, Yan Song,

313
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
greet Your Majesty.

314
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,160
You're here.

315
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,760
I

316
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
have failed Your Majesty.

317
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,160
Before I came to the capital,

318
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,360
I came to say goodbye to Your Majesty.

319
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,560
Yan Song, I've ordered

320
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,760
Lu Yi and the Three Judicial Offices to investigate Yan Shi Fan.

321
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,760
Yan Shi Fan has nothing to say.

322
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,760
He can go and tell the Three Judicial Offices himself.

323
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
You don't have to plead anymore.

324
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
I dare not.

325
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,360
Yan Shi Fan will go to the Three Judicial Offices to plead guilty.

326
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm afraid that Your Majesty

327
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,160
will be deceived by others.

328
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,160
How dare you!

329
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,960
I dare not.

330
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I'm already a guilty man.

331
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,360
When I was saying goodbye,

332
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,960
I wanted to

333
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,160
show some sincerity.

334
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,360
Tell me.

335
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,360
Yan Shi Fan told me that

336
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,160
the reason he rushed to the prison

337
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,960
was because he heard that someone was going to escape.

338
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,960
The prison is heavily guarded.

339
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,960
The man was seriously injured.

340
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,760
How could he escape?

341
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,760
The prison is heavily guarded.

342
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,360
It's hard to escape.

343
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,960
But if someone steals the day and comes to the outside,

344
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Yan Shi Fan said that when he rushed to the prison,

345
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Lu Qian Shi was there.

346
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,160
No matter how hard he rushed to the prison,

347
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,560
he wouldn't interrogate the prisoner at night.

348
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Lu Yi.

349
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,760
Why did he help the man escape?

350
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,360
I heard that Lu Qian Shi and Lan Qing Xuan had a private relationship.

351
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,560
I hope Your Majesty can investigate it.

352
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,760
Lu Yi.

353
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Master Lan.

354
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,160
Enough.

355
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,360
I have my own decision.

356
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,960
Yan Song.

357
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm here.

358
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,360
You can go back to your hometown.

359
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,560
I bow to Your Majesty.

360
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,560
What do you think of what Yan Song said?

361
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,960
Your Majesty.

362
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
I only know how to serve you.

363
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,960
I really don't know about these things.

364
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
You old fox.

365
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
What can escape your eyes in the palace?

366
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Just say it.

367
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Yes.

368
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,160
I heard that Master Lu often went to the prison to find Master Lan.

369
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,960
I thought that they had some business to do.

370
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,360
I didn't know.

371
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,560
Enough.

372
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,760
Your Majesty, please calm down.

373
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,960
Please take care of yourself.

374
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,960
Go.

375
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,160
Call Lu Yi here.

376
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Your Majesty, you can't.

377
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,760
If we call Master Lu back now,

378
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,360
if they really have a relationship,

379
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,160
it will be a big trouble.

380
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,560
What do you want?

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,760
Your Majesty.

382
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,560
If you want to know about Master Lan and Master Lu,

383
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,760
it's not difficult to know whether they have a relationship.

384
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,760
I can just go to the Palace of Spirituality secretly.

385
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,160
If they really have a relationship,

386
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,160
they will have a good relationship.

387
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,760
No.

388
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
I want to see it myself.

389
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Go.

390
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Go.

391
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,160
Great.

392
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,760
It's really a great joy.

393
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Okay.

394
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Yan Shi Fan has been grounded.

395
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Yan Song has been confiscated.

396
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,160
He is released.

397
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,960
It seems that Yan's party is going to be destroyed.

398
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,360
It's just a matter of time.

399
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Uncle Yang,

400
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,760
if you can drink, drink more.

401
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,760
Okay.

402
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,560
They talk about them first.

403
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
I talk about you.

404
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,160
You just stay.

405
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,360
In this way, Jin Xiang can still be by my side.

406
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,560
I can still see him.

407
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
Mother, I have said it.

408
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,160
I won't leave you.

409
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,560
I want to be with you forever.

410
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,560
This girl is really filial.

411
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,560
May God bless Yan Shi Fan to get retribution soon.

412
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,960
We can live a peaceful life with Jin Xiang.

413
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,360
I'm afraid Yan Shi Fan's power is really too strong.

414
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,360
Although he is grounded now,

415
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,760
but with his means,

416
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,560
I'm afraid we will be in a mess.

417
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,960
Xiao'er is right.

418
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,160
Yan Shi Fan is talented.

419
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,560
He can always play the court game with the old man.

420
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,360
If he can leave this time,

421
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,760
it's not too late.

422
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
I don't believe that no one can stop him.

423
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,760
Coming, coming.

424
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Enough, enough.

425
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Don't mention him.

426
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
You said you would mention him.

427
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,960
It's all against my taste.

428
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,760
I'll do it.

429
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,160
Shi, I'll do it.

430
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
You said you were hungry in the kitchen.

431
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
You eat first. I'll do it.

432
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,360
Give it to Aunt Yun first.

433
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
No need to be polite.

434
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,160
You have been busy all day.

435
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Hurry up and cook.

436
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,960
Come on, sit down.

437
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,960
Let's, let's, let's have a drink first.

438
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,960
Okay, okay, okay.

439
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,560
Come on, let's have a drink.

440
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,160
Okay, okay, okay.

441
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,560
Come on.

442
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,160
Okay, okay, okay.

443
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,960
Cheers.

444
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Morning, Your Highness.

445
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,960
Kid, this wine is good.

446
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
It's a little worse than the one in Yangzhou.

447
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,160
Come on, come on, come on.

448
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,960
Eat, eat.

449
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,760
It's really...

450
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,960
Little Master, you used Lan Qingxuan to eliminate Lu Yi.

451
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,160
That's wonderful.

452
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,960
Next, in this capital,

453
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,360
no one will dare to fight against you.

454
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,160
The most unappreciated thing about His Majesty is the collusion with the ministers.

455
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,760
Not to mention the Imperial Guards.

456
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,160
Lu Yi never thought that

457
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,560
Lan Qingxuan would become his last hope.

458
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,760
Without Lu Yi,

459
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,760
the Three Judicial Offices will be up to the old man.

460
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,160
In a few days, His Majesty will be clean.

461
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,960
Childe, Lu Yi has returned to his mansion.

462
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Returned to his mansion?

463
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
Didn't His Majesty blame him?

464
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,360
According to the eunuch in the inner court,

465
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
His Majesty was very angry.

466
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,560
He went directly to the Lingji Palace

467
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
to investigate Lu Yi's collusion with Lan Qingxuan.

468
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,960
He happened to run into Lu Yi, who was making the pill.

469
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
No chance to talk about it?

470
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Lu Yi?

471
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
When did he make the pill?

472
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Lu Yi really doesn't know how to make the pill.

473
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,960
But it is said that before Lan Qingxuan died,

474
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,760
he handed Lu Yi a blood test of making the pill.

475
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,960
His Majesty was angry at Lingji Palace because of that.

476
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Lu Yi's collusion with Lan Qingxuan?

477
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,160
His Majesty didn't pursue it anymore.

478
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,960
This time, he didn't kill Lu Yi.

479
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,160
What a pity!

480
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
What is Yuan Jinxia doing?

481
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
He has been investigating the case in the Six Pagoda.

482
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Lord Luo.

483
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Yes.

484
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,760
This time, it's your turn to make the decision.

485
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,560
I will follow the old man's order.

486
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Take a look!

487
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Take a look!

488
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
This one is cheaper.

489
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,360
This one is cheaper.

490
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
What's wrong?

491
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,360
Xie Yuan, do you think that man is familiar?

492
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
That man?

493
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Good luck!

494
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,160
Don't hurt me!

495
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,760
How did you find this place?

496
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
Wang Mazi?

497
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,760
Let's go and have a look.

498
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,560
Go!

499
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Go!

500
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,560
Wang Mazi, we meet again.

501
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Wang Mazi?

502
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
What Wang Mazi?

503
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,760
You must have mistaken me.

504
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,760
I am Luo Wenlong.

505
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Luo Wenlong?

506
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
You look exactly the same.

507
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,360
There are too many people who look alike in this world.

508
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
Stop pretending to me.

509
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,360
If you keep pretending to me, I will...

510
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,760
What?

511
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,360
I will kill you!

512
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Stop talking nonsense.

513
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,560
What are you doing in the capital?

514
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Where is Mao Haifeng?

515
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,760
What Mao Haifeng?

516
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,760
I have never heard of this name.

517
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,560
Is your wife and child safe?

518
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,160
I am not married.

519
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,360
How can I have a wife?

520
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Okay.

521
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,760
I don't know if you will talk like this when you go to the prison.

522
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
What do you want?

523
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Help!

524
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Help!

525
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Help!

526
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
You bastard!

527
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,560
You are a bad person.

528
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,560
Xiao Xiao, take him to the Beizhen Prefecture Office.

529
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,760
Give it to Lu Yi.

530
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Why?

531
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
He has a grudge against our Wu An Gang.

532
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,760
Why should we give it to Lu?

533
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
You are a civilian.

534
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
He is an official.

535
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Okay.

536
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
I will listen to you.

537
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
And...

538
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Talk to him.

539
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,360
I know.

540
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,760
You should smile when you see him.

541
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Is that okay?

542
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Sir, Master Xie is looking for you.

543
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Lu Yi.

544
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,760
You should thank me today.

545
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Look, who did I bring you?

546
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
He said his name is Luo Wenlong.

547
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,360
He is the last master of the Yan family, Luo Wenlong.

548
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,360
Can't you see it?

549
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,760
Wang Mazi.

550
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
You...

551
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Please don't stand here.

552
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,960
It's not your position.

553
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,360
Meng Lian, please don't stand here anymore.

554
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Luo Wenlong.

555
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,360
Do I not respect you enough?

556
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
I believe you.

557
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,360
You must be a smart man.

558
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Tell me.

559
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,160
What do you want to know?

560
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
You and Yan Shi Fan,

561
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,160
how did you get in touch with the Japanese pirates?

562
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
You are suspicious.

563
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,960
He and Mao Hai Feng,

564
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,360
the first time we were together,

565
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,560
arranged me to be by his side

566
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,760
and send messages at any time.

567
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,160
What evidence do you have to prove that you are telling the truth?

568
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,960
Under the bed in my bedroom,

569
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,360
there is a secret room.

570
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
In the secret room,

571
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,960
there are all the messages of him and Mao Hai Feng.

572
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,360
You can't know it at a glance.

573
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,560
Zi Feng,

574
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,960
go and have a look.

575
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,760
Yes.

576
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,960
Sir Lu,

577
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,560
my son has nothing to do with this case.

578
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,560
Please let them go.

579
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,960
Mr. Lu.

580
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,960
According to the testimony of Luo Wen Long,

581
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,760
we found this at his house.

582
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,160
Sir,

583
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,960
let's report to His Majesty as soon as possible.

584
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,160
Wait.

585
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
I was thinking, Yan Shi Fan is so cautious.

586
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
How could he take such an important thing

587
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,360
and take it so easily?

588
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
How could such a thing

589
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,760
be easily leaked out?

590
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,360
Here you are.

591
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:22,960
Sir,

592
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,960
you are right.

593
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,160
Although this paper has been made,

594
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,160
paper and paper will not lie.

595
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,560
The paper and paper must be made this year.

596
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,560
Look again.

597
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,560
I have been making paper and paper for my whole life.

598
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,360
What kind of tree, what kind of paper,

599
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,960
I can distinguish them all clearly.

600
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,960
So,

601
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,560
this letter is fake?

602
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,160
Yes.

603
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,560
How is it?

604
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,360
I almost fell for Yan Shi Fan's trick.

605
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,760
How could it be?

606
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,960
Didn't Luo Wen Long already admit

607
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,360
that Mao Hai Feng and Yan Shi Fan colluded?

608
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,960
But who can we think of?

609
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,360
This letter from Luo Wen Long to Yan Shi Fan

610
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,760
is all fake.

611
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
If it wasn't for Lu Yi

612
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,160
who found the paper and confirmed it,

613
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
I'm afraid this time he

614
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,760
will be caught by Yan Shi Fan.

615
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,160
Lanyan?

616
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,960
Zhai Lanyan?

617
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,560
Why is it you?

618
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,960
Zhai Lanyan,

619
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,960
since you left the harbor,

620
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
you have disappeared.

621
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,360
We thought you were a turtle

622
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,960
and hid away.

623
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
You dare not see us.

624
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,960
I dare not see anyone.

625
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,360
What a joke.

626
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,560
Okay.

627
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,960
Since you are here,

628
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
don't think of leaving.

629
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,360
Wait.

630
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Yang Yue, what do you mean?

631
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,360
Do you want to help him?

632
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
I don't want to help him.

633
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,760
I'm just thinking

634
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,160
after the battle at the harbor,

635
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,360
Zhai Lanyan disappeared.

636
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,360
Your Wu An Gang

637
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,960
has been searching for a long time in the underworld.

638
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
There has been no result.

639
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
The world is big.

640
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,560
He can find a place to hide.

641
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,760
But now

642
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
he appears in front of us in a hurry.

643
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,960
Why don't you listen to

644
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,960
what he wants to say to us?

645
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,560
Lanyan,

646
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
did Yan Shi Fan

647
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
send you here this time?

648
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
What did he want you to do?

649
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Yan Shi Fan.

650
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,560
He is really

651
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,560
good at making arrangements for me.

652
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
What happened between you and Yan Shi Fan?

653
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Where have you been

654
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,960
during this time?

655
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Master Shangguan,

656
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,160
I don't need you to bother

657
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,360
about Yan Shi Fan and me.

658
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,560
I'm here

659
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,160
to give you a big gift.

660
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,560
I just don't know

661
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
if you dare to accept it.

662
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,160
Why not?

663
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,160
May I ask Miss Lanyan

664
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,560
what kind of gift is it?

665
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Mao Hai Feng.

666
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
Mao Hai Feng?

667
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,960
Where is he?

668
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
He is outside the door.

669
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,160
It's really Mao Hai Feng.

670
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,960
He is really a crazy woman.

671
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,960
He is in your hands.

672
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
If I knew it,

673
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
I would have sent you to Lao...

674
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
Take him away.

675
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,360
And ask Lord Lu and Jin Xia to come here.

676
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
We can discuss

677
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
how to deal with him.

678
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,360
Okay.

679
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:42,760
Okay.

680
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Be careful.

681
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,560
Don't fall into Zhailanye's trap.

682
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:46,960
Don't worry.

683
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Go back quickly.

684
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,560
Okay.

685
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,360
I just heard Mao Hai Feng say

686
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,160
that Yan Shi Fan

687
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,960
gave you to him.

688
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,560
That's right.

689
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,960
Because I caught Lin Min to the Japanese pirates,

690
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,960
Yan Shi Fan was angry with me in the future

691
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,360
and gave me to Mao Hai Feng.

692
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,960
In Ceng Gang,

693
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,560
I lived a life-or-death life.

694
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Finally, one day,

695
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,160
Ceng Gang was broken.

696
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,160
I kept chasing Mao Hai Feng

697
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
and finally caught him.

698
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,160
My only purpose now

699
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,160
is to hope Yan Shi Fan

700
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
pay for what he has done for him.

701
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,080
protocols

702
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
3 days

703
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,980
Lord Hui,

704
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,760
according to Master Shangguan,

705
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
it is possible for that Yan Shi Fan

706
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
to retaliate for Zhailanye.

707
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,660
2 days

708
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,160
What happened to Luo Wen Long

709
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
just happened.

710
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,160
Mao Hai Feng was aware of it

711
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
It's too coincidental.

712
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Cen Fu, bring Mao Hai Feng here first.

713
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Sir, he's here.

714
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Mao Hai Feng, do you still remember me?

715
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Lu Yi?

716
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,160
This Zhai Lan Ye is really a lunatic.

717
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
He actually handed me over to you.

718
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
We are all old acquaintances.

719
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,160
I think you should know very well what Yan Shi Fan got from you.

720
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,160
You don't need me to go around, right?

721
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
You think I'm a fool?

722
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,160
I gave you something that saved my life.

723
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
How can I still live?

724
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
You are indeed Wang Zhi's adopted son.

725
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,160
You are indeed a good speaker.

726
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
I happen to have time today.

727
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I'll talk to you and chat with Tian.

728
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I advise you not to waste time on me.

729
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
I won't say anything.

730
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
I'm just bored.

731
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
I'm just talking to you.

732
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Why don't we talk about your adopted son, Wang Zhi?

733
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,160
When he died, you were at the port of Hangzhou.

734
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Lu!

735
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Don't try to trick me.

736
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,160
I will definitely avenge this.

737
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Avenge?

738
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,160
You can't even deal with a Zhai Lan Ye.

739
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
What revenge can you take?

740
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Mao Hai Feng, you should see the reality.

741
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,160
You don't want to kill Yan Shi Fan?

742
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,160
You don't want Wu Shou Xu to be in danger?

743
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
I do.

744
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Then let me go.

745
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
It's impossible to let you go.

746
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Look at this first.

747
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
It's impossible.

748
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
I don't believe it.

749
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Young Master!

750
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Young Master, bad news.

751
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
What happened?

752
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
What did Lu Yi do?

753
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Nothing yet.

754
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
But our men have been watching Yang Chu's house.

755
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
They are looking for the missing person.

756
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
They are looking for the missing person.

757
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
What did they do?

758
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Nothing yet.

759
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
But our men have been watching Yang Chu's house.

760
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,160
They saw Zhai and took one person in.

761
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Soon after, the man was taken away.

762
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Who?

763
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Zhai Lan Ye?

764
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Didn't you say he disappeared?

765
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Why did he appear again?

766
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
And he went to Yang Chu's house?

767
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
I don't know.

768
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,160
You!

769
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
You said he took someone to Yang Chu's house.

770
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
Who is this person?

771
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,160
According to the description, it should be Mao Hai Feng.

772
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Mao Hai Feng.

773
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Find Zhai Lan Ye and bring him to me.

774
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
And send someone to Zhao Yu.

775
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,160
We must find out what Lu Yi is doing.

776
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Yes, Young Master.

777
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Go!

778
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Lu Yi.

779
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
What's the matter?

780
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Are you sure?

781
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I think Lu Yi is really good.

782
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,160
He can get the evidence from the pirates.

783
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Are you unhappy?

784
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
No.

785
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
You can't forget Lu Yi.

786
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
You can't hide it from me.

787
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
How about this?

788
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
I like you.

789
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
If you can't, you two...

790
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Mom, stop.

791
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
What do you mean?

792
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,160
I want to be with you forever.

793
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
You are talking nonsense.

794
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
You are talking nonsense.

795
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
Mr. Lu.

796
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Do you think the memorial is more appropriate?

797
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,160
First, Yan Shi Fan and Luo Wen Long are close friends.

798
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Luo Wen Long colluded with Yan Shi Fan to collude with the pirates.

799
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,160
He gathered the pirates and made connections with the foreign countries.

800
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Second, they colluded with the robbers in the Yangtze River.

801
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,160
They recruited people and tried to rebel.

802
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Yan Shi Fan can be sent to the death cell

803
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,160
for colluding with the pirates and rebelling.

804
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,160
There is still a chance to turn the dead cell into a living one.

805
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Mr. Lu, you mean...

806
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,160
His Majesty is most disgusted with the crimes and colluding with the pirates.

807
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,160
The two crimes Mr. Xu mentioned are just collusion.

808
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,160
If they are committed again, it won't be as simple as the death.

809
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Does Lu Qian Shi have other evidence?

810
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,160
My father gave me an important information before he died.

811
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,160
It's the stone tablet Yan Shi Fan put on the ground of the battle.

812
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,160
If Yan Shi Fan doesn't want to die, it's hard for him to do so.

813
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Useless! All of them are useless!

814
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Zhai Lan Ye is now dead.

815
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Mao Hai Feng is also in the prison.

816
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,160
You don't even know what he did!

817
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
Are you useless?

818
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
Yes, I am useless.

819
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
I'm sorry, I'm incompetent.

820
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Lu Yi, what's the latest news?

821
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Lu Yi hasn't shown up for days.

822
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
We've been sending people to keep an eye on Lu's Mansion.

823
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
He hasn't been receiving any news.

824
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Where's Xu Jing?

825
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
He's just like usual.

826
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,160
He's meeting some friends.

827
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Nothing special.

828
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,160
Impossible. It's impossible to be so quiet.

829
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
Go and investigate!

830
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Yes, sir.

831
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm sorry.

832
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,160
I'm sorry.

833
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,160
I'm sorry.

834
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
I'm sorry.

835
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,160
I'm sorry.

836
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
I'm sorry.

837
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,160
I'm sorry.

839
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,160
I'm sorry.

840
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm sorry.

841
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I'm sorry.

842
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
I'm sorry.

843
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm sorry.

844
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
I'm sorry.

845
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
I'm sorry.

846
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
I'm sorry.

847
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,160
I'm sorry.

848
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,160
I'm sorry.

849
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,160
I'm sorry.

850
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,160
I'm sorry.

851
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,160
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,160
I'm sorry.

854
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,160
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
I'm sorry.

857
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
I'm sorry.

858
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm sorry.

859
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
I'm sorry.

860
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160
I'm sorry.

861
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,160
The End
