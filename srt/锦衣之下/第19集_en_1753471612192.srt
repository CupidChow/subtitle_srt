00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separated by two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see

The Long Ballad

Episode 16

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why do you say that it's caused by the palm?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
By the brain

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My grandson is amazing

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's not like me

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What should we do now?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's too hard to find the secret passage to the pirates

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have another way out

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
According to the date

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's the beginning of March

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The sea water rises in the virtual world

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And falls in the ugly world

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's the end of the world now

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The water that the sea eye connects to

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is the exit we left

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The exit of the sea water

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How to confirm where the sea eye is

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We need to use the eight-strikes thunder to infer

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,780
The front of the sky is a

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
These eight words represent eight directions

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In the eight-strikes thunder

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There is water as the path

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And in the eight-strikes thunder

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The cut is water

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The symmetrical cut is the ideal

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
These two hangings represent the whole eye

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The sea eye is the exit

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The ancient people must have a mechanism

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The wind and water are open

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Like the flood

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The dry water is closed

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
To prevent the flow of sea water

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So you look at these two directions

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is there any mechanism?

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xie Xiang, find the mechanism

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Go find it

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There is a mechanism

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So the English and the Yangs are the whole eye

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sea eye

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Gui Suer

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Which one is the sea eye?

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This way

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This way

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Jin Xia, I'm coming

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Chief Mao is really good at it

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It turned out to be Miss Zhai's big visit

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But your young master has set a date

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
To meet each other

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Chief Mao rarely comes to Yangzhou

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My young master has arranged it well

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You just need to wait for the good news

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then we will go

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will go

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will go

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will go

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will go

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I will go

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will go

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will go

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will go

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I will go

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I will go

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You just need to wait for the good news

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I came here this time

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
To remind you of something

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Please tell me

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Have you ever heard of Lu Yi?

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The son of Lu Ting, the commander of the Imperial Guards

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You are really good at the court affairs

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I am just a grass-crawler

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't be your servant

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What's wrong with Lu Yi?

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He has already been to Longdan Village

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Really?

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So what if he has been there?

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Maybe he can find out about my crazy people

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But he can't find out the secret of Suolong well

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Chief, something happened

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why are you so panic?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Suolong well has been broken

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What? Say it again

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Suolong well has been broken

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It seems that I don't need to say more

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You have already planned it

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We can't stay in Longdan Village anymore

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let all the crazy people out

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Zhong Lanyu will catch that old man

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The other people

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I won't spare any of them

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So Suolong well and this well are connected

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sir, what do you think?

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The ancients were very wise in water management

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Send the flood into the sea

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We need to use underground waterways and rivers and lakes

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In this way

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In this way, we can escape from the danger

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Black is the threat, white is the danger

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We live in the dark

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
How can we survive?

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You forgot that the dark is the shadow

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The dark is the shadow

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We choose the danger

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The so-called disaster is the end

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The disaster is the end

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Sir

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sir

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Do you like that girl?

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can see it too

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In my opinion

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This matter is quite troublesome

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She should like my Suolong well

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Isn't it quite compatible?

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Sir, you are so smart

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You just know

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't talk nonsense

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You are so disrespectful

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They are just ordinary colleagues

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Love is the most hurtful thing in the ancient times

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Wait for me

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You are so mean

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You are so mean

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'd rather rely on myself

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'd rather rely on myself

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Be careful

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Brother Lan, I'm here to save you

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are so mean

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I know you won't be mean

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Untie me

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Where are your parents?

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Untie me

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
They are still sleeping

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yesterday

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I saw my father and uncle

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Waking up a big brother

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You should go now

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Or you will be killed by Chen Jing

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wait

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let them go

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why do you wake me up?

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I saw it myself

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Brother Lan, I don't want you to die

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't worry

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't worry

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Brother Lan will not die

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I will go now

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
By the way

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't tell your parents

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Tell them you let me go

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I know

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
My hands are full

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Good brother, it's enough

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Go

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Go

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Close the door

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Give me the gun

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mom

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Find a safe place

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Find a safe place

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Go

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Thank you

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The madman is controlled by Zhu Shao

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You block it

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I will go to the one who is in charge of Zhu Shao

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Ok

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Lan Pingzi, what's going on?

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
How did these madmen get into the village?

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You ask me

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You don't give me a single one

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I ran out and met these madmen

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I almost died

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You deserve it

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Xie Xiao, I'm in a bad situation

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Go and help Mr. Lu

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm not going

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I want to protect you

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Go if you want

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I just stay with you

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
These madmen

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Only rely on the smell to recognize people

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Not to mention the emergency

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Can only be killed

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The situation is urgent

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Can only be killed

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
All the people

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Cover my nose

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everyone cover your nose

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't worry

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Uncle

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Why are you like Lan Pingzi?

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Good things like to stay until the end

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't talk about this

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you okay?

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm fine

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's good that you're fine

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Good

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Everyone, put your hands down

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's okay, it's okay

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All right

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You have clearly given it to Shen Ruo

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
How can you come out alive?

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What's going on?

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What's going on?

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What's going on?

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Team Leader Shi

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We just saved you

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Now turn around and don't recognize people

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What the hell is going on?

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What's going on?

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What's going on?

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What's going on?

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What curse

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No bad stars

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
These crazy people

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It was made by the pirates

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Lan Pingzi

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Come here

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Where are you running?

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You still want to run

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Come here

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I said you are a big man

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why are you still in a daze?

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Say it

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What they said

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is it true or false?

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Say it

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Say it

251
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Say it

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Say it

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's like this

254
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Before

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I inferred from the picture

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This Longdan Village is very evil

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If you stay for a long time, you will have a bloodbath

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's the reality

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Everyone saw it

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What about the curse you said?

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
As for this curse

262
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's what I said

263
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Bringed everyone inconvenience

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Especially the innocent people

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I am also deeply sorry

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But speaking of

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I never have a heart to harm people

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Do you say

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What you said is not a curse

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's not a curse

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Then why are my villagers crazy for no reason?

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This

273
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Say it

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Say it

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They all got poisoned

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Poisoned

278
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What poison

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Poisoned

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This poison

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
How could it be poisoned?

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Blue jade hairpin

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's from the blue mother's body

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Once a person is poisoned

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Will lose control

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Correct

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Poisoned

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why did the pirates want to poison this?

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And how do you know?

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This poison

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I made it

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Kill him

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Kill him

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Kill him

295
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Kill him

296
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let him say

297
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I was trapped in the well

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They forced me to plant flowers

299
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
To poison

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But their poison

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I didn't do it

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's not him

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Who is he?

304
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He is a hunter

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Then you tell me

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Are these people still alive?

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Correct

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is there any help?

309
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Can you save us?

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm not sure

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But you can rest assured

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I will try my best to detoxify them

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Brother

314
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Brother

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Brother

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Brother

317
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Brother

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's him

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hurry up

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's scary

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What's wrong?

322
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Nothing

323
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Hurry up

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
By the way, Shangguan

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We have been walking for so long

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You must be hungry

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Thirsty

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How about we drink some tea first?

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Eat something

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No, I'm leaving

331
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Did you hear?

332
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Something happened in Dong's water village

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What happened?

334
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Nothing

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Stop talking, let's go

336
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Master

337
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What happened?

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Nothing

339
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then why are you hiding from me?

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't be afraid

341
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Tell us everything you know

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I promise he won't hurt you

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Dong's water village was destroyed yesterday

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What?

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Say it clearly

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Master

347
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Didn't you destroy the whole water village last night?

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There are more than a hundred people in the water village

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
No one is alive

350
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is a big deal

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I guess in two days

352
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The whole Yangzhou will know

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Go

354
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Master

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Master is back

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Master is back

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Master

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Master

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Master, you are back

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Master

361
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Master

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Where is the master?

363
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
He went out and hasn't come back yet

364
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Master

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Master Shangguan

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Thank you for saving my life

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Master

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Please don't drive me out of the house

370
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm willing to accept any punishment

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Take him away

372
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He will be punished

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Thank you

374
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Wait

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you sure that I saved you?

376
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Master, you saved my life

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I will never forget it

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I mean

379
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You saw it with your own eyes

380
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I saved you

381
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
My brothers and I were trapped in a ship

382
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Suddenly I heard the sound of fighting outside

383
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
After a while

384
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's quiet outside

385
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What happened?

386
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
When we helped our brothers to pick up the goods

387
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The master has left

388
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
All the people in the boat who know the water village are dead

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Brothers

390
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hurry up

391
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Are you okay?

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hurry up

393
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hurry up

394
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go

395
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hurry up

396
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Master

397
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Is there anything wrong?

398
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Take him away

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's go

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Someone gave me a big gift

402
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What do you think?

403
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There are more than a hundred people in the whole village

404
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There is no one alive

405
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's really cruel

406
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Although I really want to move the people of Dong's water village to the end

407
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But there are more than a hundred lives

408
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I can't afford this punishment

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's go

410
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Where are you going?

411
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Dong's water village

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Master, everything is ready

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Just something happened

414
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What's wrong?

415
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The flower shop was destroyed

416
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The whole of Lanyun Village is gone

417
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You dare to ruin my good thing

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Today I will let you die without power

419
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Except that old man

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I won't leave any

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Understand

422
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hurry up

423
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hurry up

424
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hurry up

425
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hurry up

426
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There is a big blood smell

427
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Baiyu mouth should be the blood stream

428
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Who did it?

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is too cruel

430
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
so he will definitely see their prime minister from north

431
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,980
해

432
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,560
how did this wound happen, in your opinion?

433
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,200
the length and the depth

434
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,380
should be caused by a short sword

435
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,560
It is you who died.

436
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,180
Wait,

437
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
did I not tell you

438
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,320
that Lu Yi didn't tell you?

439
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,920
But Lu Yi posted such things

440
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,520
Look,

441
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,140
Were you punished by someone else?

442
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,320
How could this happen?

443
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
He can't hurt me.

444
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,360
Alright.

445
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,920
Call me if you need me.

446
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,560
You killed these people?

447
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,320
So what if I did?

448
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,000
So what if I didn't?

449
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,160
Isn't it good to have someone to avenge you?

450
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,400
You want to give me a hard time?

451
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,440
Dong Qi has been looking for you for many times.

452
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,160
The water debt of the Dong family is gone.

453
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
You should be happy.

454
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,080
I'm helping you.

455
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,200
Who wants you to help?

456
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,880
We're not friends.

457
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,760
You're a dead man.

458
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,120
Since you're caught by me,

459
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,640
go to hell with me.

460
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
Why did you lie to me?

461
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
I'm just a playboy

462
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,200
who's the most scary and the least liked by people in the troupe.

463
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,840
If I'm not Zhai Lai Ye,

464
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,400
how can I get to know you

465
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,680
and make friends with you?

466
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,920
I made friends with you

467
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
not because of my identity.

468
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,520
That's right.

469
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
I'm not a playboy.

470
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
I'm a playboy.

471
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm a playboy.

472
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm a playboy.

473
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
I'm a playboy.

474
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
I'm a playboy.

475
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
I'm a playboy.

476
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
I'm a playboy.

477
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
I'm a playboy.

478
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,400
That's right.

479
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
No matter how great I am,

480
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm just a horse in Yangzhou.

481
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,760
How can I compare myself to the leader of the Wu'an Sect?

482
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
You not only saw yourself,

483
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,600
but also saw me.

484
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
I've known you for so long.

485
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I didn't know you have such a high martial arts skills.

486
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Believe it or not,

487
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,200
I've known you the most

488
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,800
since I pretended to be a horse in Yangzhou.

489
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
The way you look now

490
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
is just like a horse.

491
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
I'm not a playboy.

492
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
The way you look now

493
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,920
is just like a horse.

494
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,520
I'm afraid you'll lose your place.

495
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,160
The leader of the Wu'an Sect,

496
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,480
is just a playboy.

497
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,600
You're just like each other.

498
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,320
Fine.

499
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,200
In your eyes,

500
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm already a ruthless person.

501
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,720
Today,

502
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,960
I'll let you go.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,720
From now on,

504
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,480
you take care of yourself.

505
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,240
Who let who go

506
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,960
is not certain.

507
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,040
Where is she?

508
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,400
Are you okay?

509
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,840
How is it?

510
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,360
Is there any cure?

511
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,520
The poison has entered the brain.

512
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's already detoxifying.

513
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,680
It's hard to recover.

514
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,160
Although it won't hurt people

515
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,960
like before,

516
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,920
but...

517
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,200
But what?

518
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,920
But it will eat you alive.

519
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,600
Say it.

520
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Is there any other way?

521
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,000
I've been addicted to the poison for more than twenty years.

522
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
But the medical skills

523
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,880
I've learned

524
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,080
are not as good as hers.

525
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,840
If she's here,

526
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,840
there might be a way.

527
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,720
She?

528
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,920
Who is she?

529
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,200
An old friend.

530
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,920
She lives in Fenglingao.

531
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,520
Fenglingao?

532
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,880
At the intersection of Yangzhou Prefecture and Zhenjiang Prefecture,

533
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,120
there's a mountain in full bloom.

534
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,000
I call her Fenglingao.

535
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,440
Someone's here.

536
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm not so sure

537
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,480
if I should break in.

538
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,560
What's up now?

539
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,560
What?

540
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,680
Quite serious!

541
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,000
Help!

542
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,400
What?

543
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,160
What's wrong with you two?

544
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,760
It's our first time.

545
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,360
He's not as Anime expert.

546
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
You are the son of the commander of the Lu clan.

547
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Who doesn't know that?

548
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
As far as I know,

549
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Chief Mao has always been active in the salt sea.

550
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
This time, he sneaked into the Yangzhou area.

551
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Our Imperial Guards didn't receive any news.

552
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Your ability

553
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
is really not comparable to the average person.

554
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I am just a pirate.

555
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
How can I be compared to the ability of Lord Lu?

556
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
In Yangzhou City today,

557
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Lord Lu is very well-versed in the Yangzhou area.

558
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,600
But you destroyed my Suolong River.

559
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:14,580
What should I do with this batch of

560
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Lu people?

561
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Don't be too much.

562
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
How dare you speak out your wild words now?

563
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I have always been very curious about Chief Mao.

564
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I heard that you have a lot of

565
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
skilled and patient people.

566
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
With the nature of Chief Mao,

567
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm afraid that there is also something to be done.

568
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
It seems that Lord Lu knows a lot about me.

569
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,600
This secret tree in the Eastern Camp is really very exquisite.

570
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
It is not comparable to the martial arts of the Central Plains.

571
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Chief,

572
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
if you spread this word,

573
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
it should be very meaningful.

574
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
It's just some tricks of the Japanese.

575
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
The Chief has never seen the common people,

576
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
but he treats it as a treasure.

577
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
If you really meet a martial arts expert,

578
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
you will suffer a great loss.

579
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Since Lord Lu is so arrogant,

580
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600

787
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,220
Jinxia.

788
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,980
Brother Xie.

789
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,340
Brother Xie. Is he okay?

790
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,140
He's fine. He's still alive.

791
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,220
He's fine. He's fine.

792
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,300
Brother Lu. Brother Lu. What's wrong with you?

793
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,620
He's poisoned.

794
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,580
The poison is quite deep.

795
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,540
It's okay to take a pulse.

796
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,780
But it's not okay to detoxify.

797
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,580
How did he get poisoned?

798
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,980
His blood is black.

799
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,500
My lord, there's poison over there.

800
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,940
I'll go find them to get the antidote.

801
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,620
Since they chose to go to the village,

802
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,460
they must have given up on this place long ago.

803
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,580
They've all left.

804
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,900
Where can we find them?

805
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,860
What should we do?

806
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,900
What should we do?

807
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
We can't just let them go.

808
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,300
We can't just let them go.

809
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:35,980
We can't just let them go.

810
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,300
What should we do?

811
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,540
I've been addicted to the poison for more than a decade.

812
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,980
But the medical skill

813
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,580
is not as good as his.

814
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,060
It's not as good as his.

815
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,420
If he's here,

816
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,380
there might be a way.

817
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,780
My lord.

818
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,220
Let's go find the old friend who Uncle Ga mentioned.

819
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,500
Lampian.

820
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,140
Do me a favor.

821
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,300
Go ahead.

822
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,580
Take Xie Xiao back to Wuwan Gang.

823
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,540
Then go to Yangzhou Guanyin.

824
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,620
Find someone named Yang Yue for me.

825
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,980
Tell him what happened here.

826
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,260
Tell him to come meet me.

827
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,700
I'll leave the mark of the six gates on the way.

828
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,100
Give him this.

829
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,740
He'll understand.

830
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,580
Okay.

831
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,180
Don't worry.

832
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,460
I'll bring your painting to him.

833
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:11,940
Thank you.

834
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,100
My lord, let's go.

835
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,300
I'll leave Xie Xiao to you.

836
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,340
Don't worry.

837
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,260
My lord.

838
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,260
The old man is caught.

839
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,940
I have to find you a new place.

840
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,900
Let me go.

841
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,940
Let me go.

842
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,300
You bastard.

843
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
Let me go.

844
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
Watch carefully.

845
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,380
Don't let this old man run away again.

846
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,780
Let's set out at night.

847
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,860
Yes.

848
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,420
Take him away.

849
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,380
Let me go.

850
00:38:59,380 --> 00:38:59,900
Go.

851
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,700
Bastard.

852
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Let me go.

853
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,260
Go.

854
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,820
Go.

855
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,500
Go.

856
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,140
Go.

857
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,860
Let me go.

858
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:29,860
Xie Xiao.

859
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,620
Senior.

860
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,340
You're awake.

861
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,020
Be careful.

862
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,820
Do you have some wine?

863
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,380
Drink some water.

864
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,980
Be careful.

865
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,060
Why am I here?

866
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,020
Where are you now?

867
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,100
I don't know.

868
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,740
I brought you home in blue.

869
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,940
What happened between you and us?

870
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,460
You brought back your drew as aeline?

871
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,900
On Luwei rivers,

872
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,340
We followed them to a village.

873
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,620
Then...

874
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,380
You can recuperate in the palace.

875
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,700
I'll report to the government.

876
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,260
The people from the government will go to find Lady Yuan and Lord Lu.

877
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,500
No. I want to go to Yuan Jinxia myself.

878
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,780
No. You can't go.

879
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,580
Why?

880
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,220
You just said that they are not ordinary thieves.

881
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,380
They are pirates.

882
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,420
If they try to frame you,

883
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,100
how can you beat them alone?

884
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,940
Senior Sister, can't you be a little nicer to me?

885
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,260
That's not what I mean.

886
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,740
What I mean is that

887
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,820
they are not ordinary gangsters.

888
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,980
We know them very little.

889
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,020
You are injured alone now.

890
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,100
What if something happens?

891
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,060
I know you care about me.

892
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,660
But I'm not a child anymore.

893
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,820
I've been out there for two or three years.

894
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,380
Yes.

895
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,660
I've been beaten, hurt and jailed.

896
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,380
But I'm standing in front of you now.

897
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,500
Senior Sister.

898
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,660
I've been wanting to ask you.

899
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,140
Do you look down on me?

900
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,140
You think I can't do anything?

901
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,340
I don't.

902
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,100
Yes.

903
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,220
I haven't made any progress these years.

904
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,780
But I'm happy.

905
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,060
You said you wanted me to be the Young Master for my father.

906
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,500
Okay. I'll be the Young Master.

907
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,660
But what does the Young Master mean?

908
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,300
They all listen to you.

909
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,100
I'm just like the painting on the wall.

910
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm just watching.

911
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,300
Now you don't even let me go

912
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,740
to the person I like.

913
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,300
Senior Sister.

914
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,380
I know you've done a lot for me.

915
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,380
But you're not my mother.

916
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,020
You're always on my side.

917
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,900
When will you be a leader?

918
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,860
Xie Xiao, you...

919
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,580
Senior Sister.

920
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,380
I really like Yuan Jin Xia.

921
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
If something happens to her,

922
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,220
I'll never be able to live.

923
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,540
Okay.

924
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,900
I know.

925
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,260
You can go.

926
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,580
Thank you, Senior Sister.

927
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,820
I'll be going.

928
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,660
I'll never let you go.

929
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,740
I understand.

930
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

931
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

932
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

933
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

934
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

935
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

936
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

937
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

938
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

939
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

940
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

941
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

942
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

943
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

944
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Open your eyes and see the cold in the north.

945
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,500
The streets are full of heaven.

946
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Who has conquered the world?

947
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:41,500
No sound, the sound of the flute is silent.

948
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,500
The fate turns.

949
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
See the change in the world.

950
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Like parting, parting is too sad.

951
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:01,500
There is a golden leaf.

952
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:07,500
I met you that day.

953
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,500
White hair written by heaven.

954
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Handwritten the journey of years.

955
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,500
Looking back to dream, can see haven jijin woods.
