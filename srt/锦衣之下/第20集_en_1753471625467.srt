00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate twice

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

Episode 16

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Senior, I've been wanting to ask you

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you look down on me?

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You think I can do anything?

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I haven't made any progress in the past few years

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I'm happy

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm happy

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You said you wanted me to be the Young Master for my father

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, I'll be the Young Master

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But what's the point of being the Young Master?

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They'll listen to you

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No matter what happens in the gang

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll just watch them like the paintings on the wall

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now you won't even let me go

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To the person I like

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Senior, I know you've done a lot for me

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But you're not my mother

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're always controlling me

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
When will I be a leader?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Xie Xiao, you

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Senior

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I really like Yuan Jinxia

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If something happens to her

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll never be able to live my life

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, I know

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can go

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you, Senior

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Young Master

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Xie Xiao, when did you come back?

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Where are Jinxia and Master Lu?

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't explain it clearly

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't worry, I'll bring Jinxia back safely

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What happened?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We broke up

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You go report to the police

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll go find someone

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Wait

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Miss Shangguan

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's wrong with you?

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Go to a place with me

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll go with you

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What?

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This wine

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
My father buried it for 20 years

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This wine can't be touched

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This wine is no longer needed

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Instead of burying it underground

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Why don't you drink it now?

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't know what's wrong with you

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But no matter how sad you are

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No matter how sad you are

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You can't just leave the house

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can't just leave the house

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't just leave the house

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You can't bring the wines that you can drink

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When you're married out

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not sad

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm just

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A little empty

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
These years

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have been waiting for her

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is it that I'm not good enough?

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is it that I'm not good enough?

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So even if he comes back

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Even if he where, I

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,400
No! You are too nice to her.

83
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,200
It's so nice that she thinks that everything is just right.

84
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I gave her everything I could.

86
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,600
Miss Shangguan, don't be sad.

87
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
You will definitely meet your husband in the future.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A hundred times better than her. A thousand times better than her!

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Wait and see.

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,300
What do you want?

91
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
After you get your husband and find your disparities,

92
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
when you get married,

93
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,900
I will go to the water to find you and give you cancer.

94
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
What if I don't marry for lifetime.

95
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,600
It won't happen.

96
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,200
There will be someone who is very good to you.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
There will be.

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
What are you doing?

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Sir, may I ask

100
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,400
if there is a brother named Yang Yue living in this station?

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Yang Yue?

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,400
The Yang Yue from the Six Gate?

103
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Yes.

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
He is not here now.

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Please go back.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
Let's come later.

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Let's go.

108
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,400
You are not the Fang Shi who sent Xie Xiao back?

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,600
It's me.

110
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
I am being asked

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
to find a brother named Yang Yue.

113
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
I am Yang Yue.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,200
What's wrong?

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
You are Yang Yue?

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's great.

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
You are so tall.

118
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,400
Let's get to the point.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am Yang Yue.

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
I am Yang Yue.

121
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
I am Yang Yue.

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
To be honest,

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Miss Yuan

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,400
asked me to bring you a message.

125
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Because the minister Lu who was with her

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
was poisoned.

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
She took minister Lu to the direction of Zhenjiang

128
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
to find a high-ranking person to detoxify.

129
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,000
By the way,

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
she also said

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,200
she would leave a mark of the Six Gate on the way

132
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
and asked you to find her.

133
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,800
This is the waist plate she gave me.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Minister Lu was poisoned.

135
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,000
This is not a joke.

136
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
I will go and tell my father.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,800
You can leave now.

138
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,600
I will go too.

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,200
Okay.

140
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Thank you for your advice.

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
It's okay.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,800
Go.

143
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,400
Go.

144
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
You didn't say you would leave us to eat.

145
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Forget it.

146
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
I hope that Lu

147
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
can come back alive.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
It's been more than ten years since I left the sect.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
It's time to go back and have a look.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
Be careful.

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
Come back to Danjing Pavilion with me.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
Forget it.

153
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
Let's go to have a meal first.

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Go.

155
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,200
My lord.

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
Hold on.

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Hold on.

158
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,400
My lord.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,600
My lord.

160
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
My lord.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,600
My lord.

162
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,000
My lord.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,600
My lord.

164
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,000
My lord.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,800
My lord.

166
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,800
My lord.

167
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,800
My lord.

168
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
Wake up.

169
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
As long as you wake up,

170
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
I will never

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
say bad things about you to me.

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,400
I will not be against you.

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
I will remember every word you say.

174
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
I will do whatever you ask me to do.

175
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
My lord, don't die.

176
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Wake up.

177
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
My lord.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Wake up, my lord.

179
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
My lord.

180
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
Wake up, my lord.

181
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,000
My lord.

182
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,000
My lord, hold on.

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
As long as we can find the hidden heart,

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
I will be saved.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
My lord, don't worry.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
I will let you live.

187
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
My lord.

188
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,900
My lord.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My lord.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,400
If I can save one's life,

191
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
I have to reach the county of Xi!

192
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,300
That can't be.

193
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,180
Then you have to Go stink

194
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,900
clean up my palace and paddy flowers.

195
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,900
Come.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm afraid that when the night falls,

197
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,200
it will all disappear and disappear.

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Sir. Sir, what's wrong?

199
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
There's no cure for the disease.

200
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,400
It's causing me to go crazy.

201
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,000
The poison is too strong.

202
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
I'll find a way to suppress the poison.

203
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
It seems that the body has been treated.

204
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,200
This is the mark left by Jinxia.

205
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
They went south.

206
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Let's go.

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Sir.

208
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Sir.

209
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Yuan Jinxia,

210
00:13:34,400 --> 00:14:00,520
you've been a

211
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm afraid that you'll catch a cold and get sick.

212
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
Why are you so nervous?

213
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Continue.

214
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Continue.

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Aren't you afraid that I'll catch a cold

216
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
and catch a cold?

217
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Okay.

218
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,200
I'll go and get some water.

219
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Okay.

220
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll go and get some water.

221
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay.

222
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll go and get some water.

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Okay.

224
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I'll go and get some water.

225
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Okay.

226
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Okay.

227
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Don't wipe it.

228
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
I'm sorry.

229
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Sir, do you have any other solution?

232
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
I have suppressed the poison.

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's good.

234
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Fill it up.

235
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,200
Hurry up.

236
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,400
Xia'er, let's go.

237
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Coming.

238
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,580
Since you have been protecting开申

239
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,320
with Grandichi φ

240
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,840
make sure

241
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,000
nobody could hurt Iceació

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,320
Do you want to

243
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,000
take Qi Zeyi away?

244
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,140
Sister

245
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,080
I can Dr Continuing

246
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,380
what's happened to monkey?

247
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,180
It's a lie

248
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,360
pushing people,

249
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,920
plenty of people

250
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,240
to be hurt

251
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,360
in the case of symptoms

252
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,360
It's because

253
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,780
too many people

254
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,060
put us in a job

255
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,840
to hold him up

256
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,340
This is Sit

257
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,100
it's an easy job

258
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,820
говоря

259
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,900
Say

260
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,680
oh

261
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,140
Oh

262
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,720
I like him too.

263
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,640
He doesn't look into the camera yet.

264
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
But he has a bad inhaling.

265
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,800
It makes me nervous.

266
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,600
What're you doing still here?

267
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,960
Stop.

268
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,320
Hurry up.

269
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,880
Hungry?

270
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,720
Give me something to eat.

271
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,040
Hungry?

272
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,200
Did you hear me?

273
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,760
Sir.

274
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,760
Speak.

275
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,400
I knew you would come just by smelling it.

276
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,760
The smell of the Imperial Guards.

277
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,640
You're a man of your word.

278
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,480
Stop it.

279
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,440
I need to eat something.

280
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,720
Sit down.

281
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,640
Sir.

282
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
What do you need?

283
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I'll prepare it for you.

284
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,560
Where did you get this jade pendant?

285
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,720
You mean this?

286
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
These are the money

287
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,200
that two guests paid for the hotel.

288
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,640
They gave me this.

289
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,640
I'm�

290
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
Today while you were out here,

291
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,880
Court Lady Hu,

292
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,640
what's the stick doing?

293
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,200
Nothing.

294
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,160
Does the Commandery Prince

295
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
keep secrets from them?

296
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,480
You are the most sure of it.

297
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,520
Are they actually's close friend?

298
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,560
But it's not like that now.

299
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,920
Forget the two of you.

300
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,600
Not bad.

301
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,760
You react fast.

302
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,920
I just want to know

303
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,160
how you found

304
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,040
we are in this inn.

305
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,520
There are my spies everywhere.

306
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,240
It's not difficult to catch you.

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,480
Catch them.

308
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,800
Don't be nervous.

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,920
Tell me first.

310
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,600
Where did you get this?

311
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,600
I made this

312
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,520
and played with it.

313
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,360
If you like it,

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,800
I'll give it to you.

315
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,360
But you have to let us go first.

316
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,640
Boss Dai,

317
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,320
we are old acquaintances.

318
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,880
Don't always fight

319
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,680
every time we meet.

320
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
It's not good.

321
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,040
I'll give you

322
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,120
this hand gun.

323
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,480
I'll give you this.

324
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,320
I'll give you this.

325
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,280
I'll give you this.

326
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,800
I'll give you this.

327
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,360
Just close your eyes.

328
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,560
Just pretend you haven't seen it.

329
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,960
I never do

330
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,920
any loss business.

331
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
So I won't let you go.

332
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,920
But if you give me this,

333
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,120
I won't kill you.

334
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,880
You.

335
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,960
Don't be impulsive.

336
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,520
Give him the hand gun.

337
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,760
Sir.

338
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,760
Give him.

339
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,720
You are so wise.

340
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,280
I've never seen

341
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,240
such a small hand gun.

342
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,840
Did you really make this?

343
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,160
There's a steel bullet inside.

344
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,400
If it's a gunpowder,

345
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,440
it's powerful.

346
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,440
Well,

347
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
let's do a deal.

348
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
You tell me

349
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,040
the production drawing of this hand gun.

350
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,280
I'll let you go.

351
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,840
I told you.

352
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

353
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,840
But I can't tell you

354
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
this method.

355
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
You are a thief.

356
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,320
If I give it to you,

357
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,400
it's a crime.

358
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
You are a thief.

359
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
You are a thief.

360
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,600
Brother.

361
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,040
There's someone here.

362
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,680
I know.

363
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,560
You're not afraid?

364
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
I'm not afraid of anything.

365
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,880
Sir.

366
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:16,960
Sir.

367
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,440
Sir.

368
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,600
Lu Yi.

369
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,440
Lu Yi.

370
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,160
Who are you?

371
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,680
Lu Yi.

372
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,800
Sir.

373
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,560
Lu Yi.

374
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,360
Don't touch me.

375
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,240
Lu Yi, don't move.

376
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,400
Sir.

377
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,440
Sir, please.

378
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,880
Nein.

379
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
Blue Fish No hammer.

380
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,680
But

381
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,320
Mr. Yuan is not like

382
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,400
the爌 people he knows.

383
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,560
The Blue Fish No hammer

384
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,920
is not the same.

385
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,640
established after poisoning.

386
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,440
He...

387
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,360
He just...

388
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,040
Just what?

389
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,840
Just,

390
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,560
his sensation

391
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,000
will maximize unlimited.

392
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,920
What do you mean?

393
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,440
Let me just explain it to you.

394
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,240
He...

395
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,280
He has seven hatreds and six desires.

396
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,560
After he's released,

397
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,040
he'll lose himself.

398
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,880
Until...

399
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,840
Until...

400
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,840
he dies,

401
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,200
he'll be angry,

402
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,280
and he'll be sad.

403
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,280
Mom!

404
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,640
I think he must be immersed in the pain.

405
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,680
Don't touch me!

406
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,680
The antidote!

407
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,000
Nui Yi!

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,640
Give me the antidote!

409
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,760
Little girl,

410
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,280
I've mentioned it.

411
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,920
There's no antidote in the Blue Jade Powder!

412
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,640
No way!

413
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
There must be a way!

414
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,120
There's a way.

415
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,920
My men are good at

416
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,760
a secret trick

417
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,560
that can cure serious diseases.

418
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,320
Although we can't cure him completely,

419
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,560
at least

420
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,680
we can make him live.

421
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,080
Right.

422
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,880
As long as you draw

423
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,040
the map of the hand-painted one,

424
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,680
I'll let them save him.

425
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,440
Save your little Qing?

426
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,040
It's okay.

427
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,440
Okay.

428
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,520
Why should I believe you?

429
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,880
Okay.

430
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't cheat them.

431
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
If you don't,

432
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,600
they'll all die.

433
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,680
I've asked them to prepare.

434
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,160
Believe it or not, you can do it.

435
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,360
Hurry up.

436
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,440
Okay, I promise you.

437
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,920
But I have a condition, too.

438
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,920
You have to send us

439
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,960
to the Zhenjiang Territory first.

440
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,800
I'll draw half of the map

441
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,280
and give it to you.

442
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,680
Okay.

443
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,720
Deal.

444
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,360
Lu Yi is really

445
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,560
a bit capable.

446
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,400
He even took the nest

447
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,680
of Mao Haifeng and Yangzhou.

448
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,240
Lu Yi is so smart.

449
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,560
He's really a man of defense.

450
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,680
Mao Haifeng has been

451
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,040
trying to win Lan Yu's favor for many years.

452
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,680
But he was ruined

453
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,880
at the last moment.

454
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,560
In your opinion,

455
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,960
is Lu Yi

456
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
a man of choice?

457
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,480
Why do you ask?

458
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,720
I've never seen you

459
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,040
care about anyone's life.

460
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,840
Even if I knew

461
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,280
he was Lu Ting's son,

462
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,040
I wouldn't care

463
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,680
about a little experience

464
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,880
because he didn't deserve it.

465
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,200
But now it's a little different.

466
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,960
He's interesting.

467
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm a little reluctant to kill him.

468
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,480
So you mean...

469
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,400
Find Lu Yi.

470
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,040
You keep an eye on him.

471
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,040
Wait for my order.

472
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,280
And

473
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,160
about meeting with Mao Haifeng,

474
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
you have to hurry up.

475
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes.

476
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,880
Where should I go?

477
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,080
Go.

478
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,840
He's going that way.

479
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,040
Let's go.

480
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,080
Don't move.

481
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,160
Someone's coming.

482
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,640
Good for you, little girl.

483
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,400
I've only been out for a few days,

484
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,560
so I can't be bothered.

485
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,880
If I don't avenge you,

486
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll let you die.

487
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
The water in the Dong family is destroyed.

488
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
It has nothing to do with Chief Shangguan.

489
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,600
Don't go so far as to blame him.

490
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,080
You little thief,

491
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
don't try to be a hero in front of me.

492
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,560
Even if it's not done by the Wu'an Gang,

493
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,880
you two have nothing to do with it.

494
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,240
What do you want?

495
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,520
I don't want anything.

496
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,840
I want you to die.

497
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,280
You die next to me first.

498
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:54,820
You should take Whip

499
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
I'll go with you.

500
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,420
You don't have the capital to negotiate.

501
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,380
Miss Shangguan, don't worry about me.

502
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,380
Hurry and leave!

503
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,380
Thief!

504
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,420
I know that you're very affectionate towards this woman.

505
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,020
But her heart is more loving than a rock.

506
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,820
Since she doesn't care about your life,

507
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,620
I'll take you in for Lord Yan.

508
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,220
So that you won't be sad in the future.

509
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
Please wait!

510
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Miss Shangguan!

511
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,220
You're such a pair of eaters.

512
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,820
It seems that she

513
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,620
doesn't have any feelings for you.

514
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,420
I'm really jealous.

515
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,420
But don't worry.

516
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,220
I'll definitely make you two

517
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,020
a pair of good-natured brutes.

518
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,620
Take her away!

519
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
Go!

520
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,420
Go!

521
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,420
Go!

522
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,420
Hurry!

523
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Go!

524
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,020
You're destined to be entangled in everything.

525
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,820
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been trapped in my hands

526
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,420
over and over again.

527
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,420
But I really don't want to kill you.

528
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,820
But you killed so many of my brothers.

529
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,020
I may be a good-natured person,

530
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,020
but I can't.

531
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
How about this?

532
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,220
You sleep with me for a night.

533
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,820
I'll make you die a happy death.

534
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,420
I hate you.

535
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,220
Why are you pretending to be a real man?

536
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,020
Brothers, let's go one by one.

537
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,820
Let the masters serve the men.

538
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Okay!

539
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,420
Thank you, Master!

540
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
Dong Xisheng!

541
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,220
How dare you touch a single hair of his?

542
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,620
I'll make you die a happy death!

543
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,820
I'll make you die a happy death!

544
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,020
I'll make you die a happy death!

545
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,420
I'll make you die a happy death!

546
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,020
I'll make you die a happy death!

547
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,620
You can't bear to do that?

548
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,420
I think you're pretty tough.

549
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,020
How about I let you try it

550
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,820
after my brothers die a happy death?

551
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,620
No!

552
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,820
No!

553
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
I want to touch him.

554
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,820
I can do anything.

555
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
What?

556
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,220
You're going to surrender so soon?

557
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,020
But I have to do it today!

558
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,620
But if...

559
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,420
If you make me happy,

560
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
I can consider

561
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,220
making you suffer.

562
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
What do you want?

563
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,420
I, Dong Jianshui,

564
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,020
have a black dog.

565
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,020
I've raised it for twelve years.

566
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,020
Every time I return to the village,

567
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,620
it's the first one to come out to welcome me.

568
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,620
But this time,

569
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,420
it and my brothers

570
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,020
will no longer appear.

571
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,020
I'll give you a chance.

572
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
Put on a black dog's chain

573
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,420
and climb over me step by step.

574
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,420
I won't let anyone

575
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
touch the woman you love.

576
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
What do you think?

577
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,020
Yang Yue, don't listen to him.

578
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,220
He's lying to you!

579
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,220
Brothers, did you hear that?

580
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,420
Chief Shangguan

581
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,820
seems to be more willing

582
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
to spend the night with us.

583
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Go and have fun!

584
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,820
Thank you, Chief!

585
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
No!

586
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
No!

587
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,820
Don't touch him!

588
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,620
Okay.

589
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,620
Sit down.

590
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,820
Wait!

591
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Yang Yue?

592
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,420
Put on his dog's chain!

593
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Yes!

594
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,820
No!

595
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
No!

596
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,020
No!

597
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Come on, Black!

598
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,220
Put on the dog's chain!

599
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Be quiet!

600
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,820
Yang Yue, no!

601
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,820
Kneel!

602
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,620
Yang Yue!

603
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
Yang Yue!

604
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,220
Come on, climb over here.

605
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,620
Climb over here.

606
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,820
Climb over here.

607
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,820
No!

608
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,220
No!

609
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Chief,

610
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,020
Black is so obedient!

611
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,220
Yang Yue!

612
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,620
Climb over here!

613
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,020
Climb over here!

614
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Climb over here!

615
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Climb over here!

616
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Climb over here!

617
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,020
Climb over here!

618
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Yang Yue!

619
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,020
You're good at climbing!

620
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Climb over here!

621
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Yang Yue!

622
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,020
Stop fighting!

623
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Yang Yue!

624
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Dong Qi Sheng, you bastard!

625
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,220
Come at me if you dare!

626
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,620
Sister Shangguan,

627
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
I advise you to stay calm

628
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
and watch the show.

629
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,620
Get up!

630
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,620
Climb over here!

631
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
Climb over here!

632
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,620
You're so happy!

633
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
No!

634
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,620
Climb over here!

635
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Get up!

636
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,620
Come on, bastard!

637
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
Come on!

638
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Kid,

639
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
continue!

640
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
Kid,

641
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
I admire your mind.

642
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Don't worry.

643
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,820
I'll take good care of you

644
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,820
and your sister Shangguan.

645
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
Then I'll send you off together.

646
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,220
You promised me that you wouldn't touch her!

647
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,220
I did.

648
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,020
Others can't touch me,

649
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
but I can't touch myself.

650
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Shameless!

651
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,820
Sister Shangguan,

652
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,420
I'll show you

653
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,820
what is real shamelessness.

654
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,780
Brother corazón.

655
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,720
Go away!

656
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,820
Move!

657
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Let go of us!

658
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,220
Move!

659
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
Chief.

660
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,020
Chief.

661
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,420
It's you.

662
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
I'm here to save you.

663
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,220
Go.

664
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
Get lost.

665
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Chief.

666
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Senior.

667
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Miss Shangguan.

668
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Senior.

669
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Yang Yue.

670
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Yang Yue.

671
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,940
Yang Yue.

672
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Yang Yue.

673
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
Miss Shangguan.

674
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
I can't die.

675
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,700
I'm just too tired.

676
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Yang Yue.

677
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
Yang Yue.

678
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,460
Go.

679
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,460
Go.

680
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Yang Yue.

681
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
Senior.

682
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,660
Why didn't you bring me with you to find Jinxia?

683
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,060
Luckily, I just came out of the village.

684
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,740
If anything happens,

685
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,500
I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life.

686
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Is that all?

687
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,420
What?

688
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
I mean,

689
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,860
you don't care about your own safety.

690
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,700
If you were the one who met Dong Qisheng last night,

691
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,660
you should have a break.

692
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm the sinner of the Wu An Gang.

693
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,820
Senior, what are you talking about?

694
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,420
I've long disliked

695
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,180
Dong Qisheng, the shameless bastard.

696
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,140
He's not capable enough to be taken in by others.

697
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,060
He's just trying to make us the Wu An Gang angry.

698
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,460
I should have killed him long ago.

699
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,740
Enough.

700
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,220
Don't disturb Yang Yue.

701
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,260
Let her go.

702
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,420
She's awake.

703
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,020
Yang Yue.

704
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
You're awake.

705
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
Miss Shangguan.

706
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Come.

707
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
It's good that you're awake.

708
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,100
It's good that you were here yesterday.

709
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Senior,

710
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
stay here and take good care of her.

711
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,100
I'll go and find Jinxia.

712
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Stop.

713
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
You can't go anywhere without my permission.

714
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Senior,

715
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,820
I'll listen to you no matter what you say.

716
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,660
But not this time.

717
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,940
Maybe Jinxia is nothing to you.

718
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,580
But to me,

719
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,020
she's the most important person.

720
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,820
You...

721
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Xie Xiao.

722
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,220
You're too hurtful.

723
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,260
When Master Shangguan came to me,

724
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,140
he said he would help you find Jinxia.

725
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,820
He never gave up on this.

726
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,140
Dong Qisheng caught us.

727
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,940
He even humiliated her.

728
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,540
She just got out of danger.

729
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,740
You're going out.

730
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,700
The five-headed flies are looking for you.

731
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,420
If anything happens,

732
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,140
how can she be at ease?

733
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,860
But Jinxia is now...

734
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,860
Enough.

735
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
Yang Yue.

736
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,100
I think it's not your turn to help me.

737
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Xie Xiao.

738
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
You're right.

739
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Yuan Jinxia is nothing to me.

740
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,380
I don't need to worry about her.

741
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,100
I'm looking for her because of you.

742
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,620
If you don't believe me,

743
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,940
you can leave.

744
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,140
Miss Shangguan.

745
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Senior.

746
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,860
Senior.

747
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Deputy Chief.

748
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,260
He'll sacrifice his life for you.

749
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,640
Since Chief has left behind the

750
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,500
Madam of the Wu Family,

751
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,540
I need to delete you.

752
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,420
What's wrong with Jinxia?

753
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Deputy Chief.

754
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,020
Ranger Xie.

755
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,700
I thought Jinxia was me.

756
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,500
Aren't I iceberg?

757
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,740
I have a chance to apologize to you.

758
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,460
Dehating Wang compartir

759
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,340
Miss Shangguan.

760
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,860
Last night

761
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,340
you are not awake at all, right?

762
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,740
What I said last night

763
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,340
Don't mind me.

764
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,140
I just feel ashamed enough.

765
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,740
I don't want to look even worse.

766
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,540
You don't have to explain.

767
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,460
I understand.

768
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,300
I still care about your life-saving needle.

769
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,740
I will never forget it.

770
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,460
Don't say that.

771
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,260
Doing all these for you is nothing.

772
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,940
You absolutely would die in taverns for me.

773
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,420
Brother Yang.

774
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,900
Brother Yang.

775
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,660
What are you thinking?

776
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,500
Last night,

777
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
You...

778
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Although I've been a cook for many years,

779
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,420
I've never hurt anyone.

780
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,420
Jinxia always said that my hands

781
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,180
are the cook's hands.

782
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,620
But I didn't expect that

783
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,340
when I cook like this,

784
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,620
I can kill someone.

785
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,540
You can't tolerate a woman

786
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,180
in the martial arts world.

787
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,900
I envy you.

788
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,180
You're not used to killing people.

789
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,260
I hope this is the first and last time

790
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,460
you kill someone.

791
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
We're here.

792
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,060
You can draw the rest of the drawings

793
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,060
for me now.

794
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
But how can I draw it

795
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,060
if you tie me up like this?

796
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,660
Bring the pen and ink here.

797
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,660
Yes.

798
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
I'll go get it.

799
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,660
What's wrong?

800
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,660
My hand was modified by Master Lu.

801
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,660
It's not the original design.

802
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,660
I can't draw it now.

803
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
How about...

804
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,660
How about

805
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,660
I ask Master Lu to come here

806
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
so that he can escape?

807
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
No, no, no.

808
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
How is that possible?

809
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Look at him.

810
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Can he run away?

811
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,180
The wind howls, the ship's sail

812
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,180
My heart is in a whirlpool

813
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,180
A thousand miles of ambush

814
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Who is out there

815
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,180
Can't compare to fate

816
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,180
Close your eyes, I can see your face

817
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Open your eyes, the north is quiet

818
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,700
The sword is full of sky

819
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:11,700
Who has conquered the world

820
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:21,020
No sound, the

821
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,020
See the change in the world

822
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:31,020
Like farewell, too deep

823
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,860
The yearning is golden

824
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:43,860
The day I met you

825
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,860
White hair from blood

826
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,860
We've been through years

827
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:56,860
A thousand years in a blink

828
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,860
The love of my life

829
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,860
The love of my life

830
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,860
The love of my life

831
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,860
The love of my life

832
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,860
The love of my life

833
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,860
The love of my life

834
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,860
The love of my life

835
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,860
The love of my life

836
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,860
The love of my life
