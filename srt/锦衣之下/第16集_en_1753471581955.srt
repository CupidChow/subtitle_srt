I'm afraid that you can't recover in three to five hours.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know how Xie Xiao is doing.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She's fine.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She'll be fine.

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You should worry about your own life.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Sir, I'm with her.

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm not afraid of her.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm afraid that she'll be in danger.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm afraid that she'll be in danger.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You should worry about your own life.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sir, I'm with them.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to skin them.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Chief.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Chief.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What are you looking at?

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm looking at the eyes of Xiao Yan.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They are indeed the soldiers of the disaster.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The soldiers of the disaster?

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
These two people can't be killed.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Master Lan.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you think about how to deal with them?

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's okay.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll do it now.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you for your practice.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Seems like he really needs to have training now.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
After everyone died,

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
there must be someone around him.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Senior Gundang.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Zhaoxia does not understand me at all.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's not like that.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,380
Cr stuck and idle

43
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,180
Ricardo wrapped in a cinder

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,100
Practice as the ideal

It's broken.

52
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Break it.

53
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,920
You're not good enough.

54
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
Don't worry, everyone.

55
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
I've already

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,440
suppressed the stars.

57
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Get up.

58
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm relieved.

59
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I'm relieved.

60
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Get up.

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,920
Master Lan, in my opinion,

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,080
I'd rather kill these two people.

63
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't talk nonsense.

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,120
There are rules in this world.

65
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,520
You can't act recklessly.

66
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,480
You're the stars of my clan.

67
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,720
You must be eliminated

68
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
to avoid future trouble.

69
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't understand.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
What stars?

72
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
How can you listen to his nonsense?

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
He's a liar.

74
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,320
Old man,

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,480
why don't you let us go first?

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
We can talk it over.

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,000
Master, please don't.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,840
These two stars

79
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,960
can't be let go easily.

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Yes, we can let them go.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
We can let them go.

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Yes, we can let them go.

83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,880
We can let them go.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,680
Master.

85
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
Master Lan, in your opinion...

86
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
No.

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
It's like this.

88
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,240
The stars in these two people's bodies

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,880
have been sealed by me

90
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,160
temporarily by the power of the heavens.

91
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,360
Now, they're just like ordinary people.

92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,160
If we kill them recklessly,

93
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,840
I'm afraid it'll cause the heavens to be angry

94
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,280
and bring disaster to everyone.

95
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
That's terrible.

96
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
What should we do then?

97
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
We can't let them go.

98
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
We can't let them go.

99
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
We can't let them go.

100
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
We can't let them go.

101
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,040
We can't kill them.

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,160
But these two people are unknown.

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,280
They broke into the village at this time.

104
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,400
Our leader might lock them up.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,040
After I bring the heavens back,

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
we'll make a plan.

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Okay.

108
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,240
Guards.

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,840
Yes.

110
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,040
Lock these two people in the woodshed.

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Yes.

112
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,320
You're a liar.

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,240
Let go of me.

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,880
Are you crazy?

115
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,480
Stop.

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,680
You're crazy.

117
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Thank you, master.

118
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
I've talked to you about this.

119
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,040
I'll take revenge for you.

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,640
Please take it.

121
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Leader.

122
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,440
Killing demons and devils is my duty.

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
If you say so,

124
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
I'll be fired.

125
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Let's go.

126
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Let's go.

127
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,440
By the way,

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I suggested you to think about

129
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,040
the leader's matter.

130
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,240
My clan has been here for over two thousand years.

131
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,040
I'll discuss with you

132
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,240
about the matter

133
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,440
when my clan is here.

134
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Okay.

135
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
It's up to you.

136
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Please.

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Please.

138
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
How is it?

139
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I found a mark.

140
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,840
But I can't see

141
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
any clear direction.

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,640
What should we do now?

143
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,040
Will they be in trouble?

144
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,440
It's my fault.

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't worry.

146
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,840
They'll be fine.

147
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
Have you heard of

148
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
the village on the cliff?

149
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I didn't see any mark

150
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,240
on the map of Yangzhou.

151
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
Sir.

152
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,240
Those pirates are so strange.

153
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,640
They disappeared when we arrived at the village.

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,040
They even lost footprints.

155
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,840
There must be demons in every place.

156
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,840
What about those crazy people?

157
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,440
Why are they so strong?

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
They're so weak.

159
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Even those who have been to the Iron-Head Palace

160
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
might not be able to defeat them.

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
And that Zhu Shaosheng.

162
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
Zhu Shao is a deity.

163
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
The crazy people are a deity.

164
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Sir.

165
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Do you think Zhu Shaosheng

166
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,640
is controlling the crazy people?

167
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm not sure

168
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,040
what happened in Longdan Village.

169
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,640
I'm not sure either.

170
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
It's cold here.

171
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Cover the blanket.

172
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,040
Thank you, Madam.

173
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
You're welcome.

174
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Madam.

175
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,840
Tell the village chief

176
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,040
that we're not bad people.

177
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
We're good people.

178
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
We can prove our innocence.

179
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,840
We're...

180
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,040
That person has been in poor health.

181
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,240
We heard that there's a rare herb

182
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,640
nearby that can cure his body.

183
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,440
We're looking for someone to lead the way

184
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
and enter this village.

185
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,040
We were attacked by the crazy people at the village.

186
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,440
Then the village chief took the villagers

187
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
and used anesthetic to knock them down.

188
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
We didn't have time to react,

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,440
so we were locked down.

190
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
I think

191
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,040
you're not bad people.

192
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
I'm the village chief's wife,

193
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,240
but it's about the lives of the whole family.

194
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I can't do anything about it.

195
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
I can help you with the painting,

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,240
but I can't help you with anything else.

197
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Madam.

198
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Do you know

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,240
how the man who went up the mountain with us is?

200
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I don't know.

201
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
Madam.

202
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
In this village,

203
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,240
is there anyone else

204
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,840
besides you?

205
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,240
No.

206
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,840
Have you seen anyone from the Eastern Camp?

207
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
The Eastern Camp?

208
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Only people from our village live here.

209
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Mother.

210
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Be careful.

211
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,240
I told you not to go anywhere.

212
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,840
Otherwise, your father will beat you.

213
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Let's go.

214
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,840
That man has been in poor health.

215
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
Sir.

216
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,040
Why did you pretend to be my wife?

217
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,240
If you don't want to show your official status,

218
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,440
then he can be like the one in the troupe

219
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,040
who played the role of a brother and sister.

220
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,840
For the sake of my wife,

221
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,640
I don't want to be a friend who takes medicine for the sake of my life.

222
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm smarter than the one who escaped from death.

223
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm smarter than the one who escaped from death.

224
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,240
You're so cunning.

225
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,240
You're so clever.

226
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Don't move.

227
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm a little tired.

228
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Lean on me.

229
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,840
Once the silver moves,

230
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,840
the silver will be enough to feed the tiger.

231
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,040
The night will be bright.

232
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
No wine.

233
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
No chicken.

234
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
No you.

235
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Zhi.

236
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,040
Little bastard.

237
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
I told you to come in.

238
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,840
Why didn't you knock the door when you came in?

239
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,440
This house belongs to our Longda Village.

240
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,640
Why can't I come in?

241
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,440
You...

242
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,840
You're not smart.

243
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
You're so arrogant.

244
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm a guest that your father paid a lot of money to invite.

245
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,840
You don't respect me.

246
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,640
Aren't you afraid that your father will beat you?

247
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,840
Don't tell my father.

248
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
I'm telling your father.

249
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
Come on. Go find your father with me.

250
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,240
Aren't you crazy?

251
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
My father said

252
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
you can't drink and eat meat.

253
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,640
I said you're a liar.

254
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,440
I want to tell my father about your stealing chicken.

255
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Well...

256
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Let's not go.

257
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
It seems that

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,440
you've never left Longda Village.

259
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,240
How do you know?

260
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Of course.

261
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,840
The person who catches the demon

262
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,040
can't drink and eat meat.

263
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,640
That's the old emperor.

264
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,240
The rules are so unethical.

265
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,640
It's been abolished.

266
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Really?

267
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Really.

268
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
As the saying goes,

269
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,440
wine and meat are always together.

270
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,440
As long as there's a blessing in the heart,

271
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,840
it will be everywhere.

272
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm a future demon-catching person.

273
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,040
Come on.

274
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
This way.

275
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,440
Come on. Come here.

276
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I...

277
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,040
I'll treat you to chicken.

278
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
How about it?

279
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,840
Because we're good brothers.

280
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Come on.

281
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,240
But...

282
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
What but?

283
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,240
This roasted chicken

284
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,440
is my exclusive recipe.

285
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
You can't eat it.

286
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Come on.

287
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Can you tell me

288
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,440
the story outside?

289
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Sure.

290
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
But...

291
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,040
about our chicken today...

292
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Don't worry.

293
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
It's our secret.

294
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Good brother.

295
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
So interesting.

296
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
It's a deal.

297
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Come on.

298
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Shangguan.

299
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,440
You've been drinking all the way.

300
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,040
You're so drunk.

301
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
You've been drinking all the way.

302
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Stop drinking.

303
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
None of your business.

304
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,040
You're drunk.

305
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Stop drinking, Shangguan.

306
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Give it back to me.

307
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Be careful.

308
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
You...

309
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
You're drunk.

310
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,040
Let me take you home.

311
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Brother.

312
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,640
Where are you?

313
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Don't worry.

314
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
He'll be fine.

315
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,840
I know you

316
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
don't like me.

317
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,840
My father and your father forced me.

318
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
But I can't hurt you forever.

319
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
You really don't know?

320
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Or you're pretending?

321
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Why can't everyone

322
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
see my love for you?

323
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
But you don't know it at all?

324
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I...

325
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Xue Xiao.

326
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
What should I do with you?

327
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
It's so hard

328
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
to be alone.

329
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
It's okay.

330
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
No matter what happens in the future,

331
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I'll be here.

332
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
You're not him.

333
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
You can't replace him.

334
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
You're not him.

335
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
You can't replace him.

336
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
You're not him.

337
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,840
You can't replace him.

338
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
You're not him.

339
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,840
You can't replace him.

340
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
You're not him.

341
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
You can't replace him.

342
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
You're not him.

343
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
You can't replace him.

344
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
You're not him.

345
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
You're not him.

346
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
You're not him.

347
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
You're not him.

348
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
You're not him.

349
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
You're not him.

350
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
You're not he.

351
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
You're not him.

352
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,840
You're not him.

353
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
You're not him.

354
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
When you get married,

355
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
you should be nice to your parents.

356
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Don't ride the wild Sparrow or you'll have handsome face.

357
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
But when I see you sad,

358
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
I almost cry.

359
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Can't you see I have a clear mind?

360
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
If you are if you don't want me to stay,

361
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Let's go.

362
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
What?

363
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
My dear heroes,

364
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
I'm passing by Miss.

365
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
I won't disturb you.

366
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
I won't disturb you.

367
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Who did this?

368
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
No, no.

369
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Hero, hero.

370
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Hero, hero.

371
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Help me, help me.

372
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
You liar.

373
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
We almost got you killed.

374
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
You liar.

375
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
You liar.

376
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
You liar.

377
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
You liar.

378
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
You liar.

379
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
You liar.

380
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
You liar.

381
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
You liar.

382
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
You liar.

383
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
We almost got you killed.

384
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Sir, let go.

385
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Let him die.

386
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
No, I can't die.

387
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
I can't die either.

388
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Hero, hero.

389
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Help me.

390
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
I promise.

391
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
I promise I won't lie to anyone anymore.

392
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
You can let go.

393
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
But you have to tell me

394
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
everything about the village.

395
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
I'll tell you.

396
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
I'll tell you everything.

397
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Help me to get the bullet.

398
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
I'm afraid of heights.

399
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
I'm scared.

400
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I'm scared.

401
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Hey.

402
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
You broke the ladder.

403
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
You wronged me.

404
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm stupid.

405
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
I came here to do this.

406
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
I broke my own back.

407
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Then why are you here?

408
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I want to run.

409
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
You want to run?

410
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Yes.

411
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
You.

412
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Stop fighting.

413
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Stop talking nonsense.

414
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Tell us.

415
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
What do those people

416
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
and the villagers

417
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
who are the victims

418
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
mean?

419
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Say it.

420
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
This village

421
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,840
is where the people of their family live.

422
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Just half a year ago,

423
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
something strange happened in the village.

424
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
The villagers

425
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
suddenly got sick.

426
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
First, they were not feeling well.

427
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Then they suddenly became strong

428
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
and started fighting.

429
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
The villagers died

430
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
because of this.

431
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
They had no choice.

432
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
So they kicked out

433
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
all the people who were crazy.

434
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
Why is that?

435
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I don't know.

436
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I don't know either.

437
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
They asked a lot of doctors to check on them.

438
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
But they couldn't find a cause.

439
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
They thought they were poisoned.

440
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
That's why

441
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
they invited me to do this.

442
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
So you told them

443
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
that you were a jinx.

444
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
I just

445
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
said it casually.

446
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
You said it casually.

447
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
We almost died.

448
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
You.

449
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
I wanted to save you.

450
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
But who told you

451
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
to say I was a liar

452
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
in front of so many villagers?

453
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Then I'll show you

454
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
how powerful I am.

455
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
You.

456
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
You.

457
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Do you know that

458
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
you talk nonsense

459
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
and are a jinx?

460
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
You are a jinx.

461
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
You are the jinx.

462
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Enough.

463
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Stop fighting.

464
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
I'm not.

465
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Are you happy now?

466
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
But

467
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I'm kind enough to tell you.

468
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
What I said

469
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
is not all false.

470
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
I found that

471
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
this village

472
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
is very deadly.

473
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
If we stay here for long,

474
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
there will be a bloodshed.

475
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Bloodshed?

476
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Don't think I'm a half-dick.

477
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm a serious man.

478
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
I really think that

479
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
this place is too deadly

480
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
based on the picture.

481
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
If we stay here for long,

482
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
we will be...

483
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
If it wasn't for the bloodshed,

484
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I would have left long ago.

485
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
You are afraid that

486
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
you will be exposed

487
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
and can't leave, right?

488
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
I...

489
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
What about the jinx?

490
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
The jinx...

491
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
I found it

492
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
based on the yin-yang gossip.

493
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
From the picture,

494
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
this place

495
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
is indeed

496
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
occupied by the jinx.

497
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
You are still talking nonsense.

498
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm not talking nonsense.

499
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
How long have you been in this village?

500
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
More than a month.

501
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Have you seen anyone

502
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
other than Sun Ming?

503
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
I haven't seen anyone

504
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
other than Shi clan.

505
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
By the way,

506
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
just now,

507
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
just now,

508
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
I thought

509
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
that I got the reward anyway.

510
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I should go.

511
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Who knows?

512
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I went out of the village

513
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
and saw several men

514
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
sneaking into the forest.

515
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
It's my curiosity.

516
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
I followed them in

517
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
and checked.

518
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Who knows?

519
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
When I went in,

520
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
those men

521
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
were pointing at me with such a long knife.

522
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
If I wasn't smart,

523
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
I would have...

524
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Where did you see them?

525
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,840
In the forest behind.

526
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
By the way,

527
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
they seemed to have

528
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
someone in their hands.

529
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Who?

530
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I told you who it was.

531
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
How could I know who it was?

532
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Could it be Xie Xiao?

533
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Who?

534
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Take us to check.

535
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
No, no.

536
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
The forest is so dangerous.

537
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
It's almost dawn.

538
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Let's go after dawn.

539
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
I'm not going.

540
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm not going.

541
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
There's no trace left.

542
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Then we can't tell

543
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
if it's Xie Xiao.

544
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Sir,

545
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
could it be that

546
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
the men found us

547
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
and followed us up

548
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
to cut the ladder

549
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
and didn't let us leave?

550
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
It's getting more and more interesting.

551
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
I don't find it interesting at all.

552
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
I just don't know

553
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
what's going on.

554
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
I just don't know

555
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
what's going on.

556
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
I just don't know

557
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
what's going on.

558
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
I just don't know

559
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
what's going on.

560
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Well,

561
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
it's so creepy.

562
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Let's go out first.

563
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Why didn't you see Lan Pian

564
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
when you were lying to me?

565
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
You're so timid.

566
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Master Lan,

567
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
where are those

568
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
crazy people now?

569
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
They usually

570
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
wander around the mountain.

571
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
You've been here

572
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
for a month.

573
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
You should be familiar

574
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
with the terrain here.

575
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Do you know

576
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
if there's any other way

577
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
to get down?

578
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
I can't know everything.

579
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Don't try to sneak away.

580
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
I'm telling you,

581
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
if you don't take us to the patrol,

582
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
I'll tell you

583
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
all the lies you've told.

584
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Oh,

585
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
you can tell them.

586
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
The villagers

587
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
are so blinded by me now.

588
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
You're just a little liar.

589
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
You can just lie to the fishermen.

590
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
You're lying to me?

591
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
You just calculated

592
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
the weather that day

593
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
and did it on purpose, right?

594
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Tell me.

595
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
What else do you have?

596
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Just tell me.

597
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
I'll break your legs.

598
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Okay.

599
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
It's already dawn.

600
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
The villagers

601
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
will find us

602
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
and find a way

603
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
to catch us.

604
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Hurry up.

605
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
We need to find a way to get down.

606
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Why can't you understand?

607
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Don't say anything.

608
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Hurry up.

609
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Okay.

610
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
I'll take you there.

611
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
You guys

612
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
don't dare to go into the water.

613
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
So many!

614
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Xie Xiang, are you okay?

615
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Xie Xiang.

616
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
It's okay.

617
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Thank god you're here.

618
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Please bless us.

619
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Please bless us.

620
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
We must not let ourselves be cheated.

621
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Xie Xiang,

622
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
are you okay?

623
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Xie Xiang.

624
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
It's okay.

625
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Thank god you're here.

626
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Please bless us.

627
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Please bless us.

628
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Miss,

629
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
what are you doing?

630
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,720
J intimate you

631
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
put on clothes in the make-up shop.

632
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Is this what you think?

633
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
A woman

634
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
must not die

635
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
by the maleddal.

636
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
I put on clothes

637
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
to weavers♥

638
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
But the merit

639
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
is fully buried.

640
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Can somebody

641
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
come up here?

642
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Thank you, please.

643
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Father, rest assured.

644
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Lord Lu is a skilled martial artist.

645
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Xie Xiao is also a trainee.

646
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,840
With them protecting Jin Xia, everything will be fine.

647
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
I hope so.

648
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Young Master, they seem to have discovered Longdan Village.

649
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I'm afraid they've already found it.

650
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
It's fine to discover a village.

651
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Have you found anything else?

652
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
I'm not sure.

653
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,840
But they followed the head of the family.

654
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
What if they discover us?

655
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Go tell him to be careful.

656
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
If it doesn't work,

657
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,840
then let's just solve it.

658
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Yes.

659
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,840
You liar! Why didn't you use that powder earlier?

660
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
What powder? It's a drug. It's expensive.

661
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
You want money or life?

662
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I want... I only have a little.

663
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,840
But I can only use it when it's important.

664
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
You're hurt?

665
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,840
It's fine. It's just a small wound. I won't die.

666
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

667
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,840
If I can't marry you, I won't rest in peace.

668
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

669
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
I see that your wound is quite deep. I'll bandage it for you.

670
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
It's fine. It's just a small wound.

671
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
It's not that troublesome.

672
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Here.

673
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Okay.

674
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Beat him!

675
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
I'll beat you!

676
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Stop!

677
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Run!

678
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Xia Yuan Yuan, get up.

679
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Your face is swollen.

680
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
It hurts!

681
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Your hand is hurt too!

682
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Don't move. I'll bandage it for you.

683
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Xia Yuan Yuan, do you know that

684
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
the knot that the captain of the old ship from the sea

685
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
used to tie the rope

686
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
is used to tie it.

687
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
My mother taught me that.

688
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Ordinary people can't do it.

689
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Just get angry with me.

690
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
You're embarrassing me.

691
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
If you don't want to get angry,

692
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
I'll beat you.

693
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
I'll beat you.

694
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
I'll beat you.

695
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
I'll beat you.

696
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
If you don't want to get angry,

697
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
you should look more angry than them.

698
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
If you can't do it,

699
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
you can come to the top of Mount Tai.

700
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
You're so fat.

701
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
They definitely can't climb up.

702
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
I'm not fat.

703
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Stop crying.

704
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
I'll beat you.

705
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
I'll beat you.

706
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Really?

707
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Okay.

708
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Xia Yuan Yuan,

709
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
do you remember this knot?

710
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Of course I remember.

711
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
I used to bandage it for you when I was a kid.

712
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
My head was tied there.

713
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
There's a big butterfly knot.

714
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Okay, don't waste time.

715
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
It's not a good place to stay.

716
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
That's right.

717
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Why are you in a hurry?

718
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Didn't you see me talking to Jin Xia?

719
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Master Lan,

720
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
is there any place

721
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
you can avoid?

722
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
I have to think about it.

723
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
You're a liar.

724
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
You can't leave a way for yourself.

725
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Say it.

726
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
I remember it now.

727
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
There's a little house over there.

728
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
I just found it the day before yesterday.

729
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
I'll take you there now.

730
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
Here it is.

731
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Sir.

732
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Sir.

733
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
We can rest here today.

734
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
You and Master Lan

735
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
go in and clean the house.

736
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
I'll find something to eat nearby.

737
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Lan Ping Zi, let's go.

738
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Clean the house.

739
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
You.

740
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Come with me.

741
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
I'm not going.

742
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
I'm injured.

743
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Didn't you say that

744
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
this injury is nothing to you?

745
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
What?

746
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
You feel the pain now?

747
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Jin Xia, what do you want to eat?

748
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Wild chicken or wild rabbit?

749
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
I'll get it for you.

750
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
Wild chicken.

751
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Okay.

752
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Forget it.

753
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
It may not be possible to get it.

754
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Just pick some fruits.

755
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
Go back quickly.

756
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Okay, wait.

757
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Why are you walking so fast?

758
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Do you know where the chicken is?

759
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
I know.

760
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Where is it?

761
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
Behind me.

762
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Does Sir Lu not see

763
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
that I'm close to Jin Xia?

764
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Did you deliberately point me out?

765
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
You're thinking too much.

766
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Sir Lu, I'm very not used to

767
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,840
you being so straightforward to Jin Xia.

768
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
She's my subordinate.

769
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
I have to do what I ask her to do.

770
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
What?

771
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Do you still love the eyes of Young Master Xie?

772
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
I've known him for more than ten years.

773
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
His business is my business.

774
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Oh, I remember.

775
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
If I remember correctly,

776
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Young Master Xie should have just proposed to be married.

777
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
I think your bad temper

778
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
is really your strong suit.

779
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
You!

780
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
I...

781
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
You're back!

782
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Wow, Xian Yue Yue, you're amazing.

783
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
You said you were playing a game,

784
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
but you really came back with a game.

785
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
What's wrong?

786
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
You're not happy to praise you?

787
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Hmm.

788
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
I didn't hit you.

789
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Oh, it's your hand.

790
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
I knew it.

791
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Look at this gold.

792
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
It's very rare.

793
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
It's a momentary death.

794
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
You didn't suffer any punishment before you died.

795
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Sir, you're good at martial arts.

796
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Enough.

797
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Stop playing with horses.

798
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Everyone is hungry.

799
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Sir, I'm going to prepare

800
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
some food for you.

801
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Just wait for the food.

802
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
I just played a little wild chicken.

803
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
What's so great about it?

804
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
I'll play a bigger one tomorrow.

805
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Okay.

806
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Then tomorrow, we'll wait for Young Master Xie

807
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
to play a bigger wild chicken.

808
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
I'll wait.

809
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Jin Xia, I'll help you cook wild chicken.

810
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
These two men are jealous.

811
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
They're more excited than women.

812
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I'll eat chicken tomorrow.

813
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Here.

814
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Thank you.

815
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Sir, you eat first.

816
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,840
You're good at

817
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
fighting with a chicken.

818
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Where did you learn it?

819
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
I'll give him this leg.

820
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Thank you.

821
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Sir, Miss.

822
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I don't know what you're called.

823
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Please introduce yourself.

824
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
I forgot to introduce myself.

825
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
My name is Yuan.

826
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
My name is Jin Xia.

827
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
This is Lu Yi.

828
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
This is Jin Xia.

829
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
This is Lu Yi.

830
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
This is Xie Xiao.

831
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
How about you?

832
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
My name is Lan.

833
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
My surname is Jin Xue.

834
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
By the way,

835
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,840
I've been thinking about something

836
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
and I'm too embarrassed to ask.

837
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Just ask.

838
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,840
I think you've always called Mr. Lu an adult.

839
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Are you from the Guan family?

840
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
I'm from the Guan family.

841
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
I'm here to investigate the case.

842
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
No wonder.

843
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
No wonder what?

844
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
No wonder you're young

845
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
and have a good horse.

846
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm a good horseman.

847
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
I'm not a good horseman

848
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
compared to you.

849
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
We're the same.

850
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
I'm a good horseman.

851
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
I'm a good horseman.

852
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
We're not the same.

853
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
We're the same.

854
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
By the way, Xie Xiao,

855
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
how did you escape from danger yesterday?

856
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
You finally remember me.

857
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Yesterday...

858
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Jin Xia!

859
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Luckily, I reacted quickly.

860
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Otherwise, it would be dangerous.

861
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
At that time,

862
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
a gust of wind blew over me.

863
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,840
It blew me back and forth.

864
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
At that time,

865
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I only had one belief in me.

866
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,840
That belief was Jin Xia.

867
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Focus.

868
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Jin Xia is a good horseman.

869
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
He's a good horseman.

870
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
He's a good horseman.

871
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
He's a good horseman.

872
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
He's a good horseman.

873
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
He's a good horseman.

874
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Focus.

875
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
Then I climbed up

876
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
with a slight move.

877
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
They chased me like this.

878
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
They chased me all the way

879
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
into the forest.

880
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Then they forced me to jump into the water.

881
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Then you'll know.

882
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Xiao Ge,

883
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
you're so lucky.

884
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
So,

885
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
you were chased by the crazy people last night?

886
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840
But those crazy people are not that bad.

887
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
They can't catch you.

888
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,840
Who said that?

889
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
That's because I'm good.

890
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,840
And I found a strange place.

891
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
What strange place?

892
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,840
I was forced into the water by them.

893
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Guess what?

894
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
What?

895
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
After I completely fell into the water,

896
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
they didn't attack me.

897
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
They didn't attack you after you fell into the water?

898
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Yes.

899
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
These crazy people

900
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840
won't attack each other.

901
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
But if it's really a windmill,

902
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
they should not be able to tell the enemy from me.

903
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Yes.

904
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
It's quite strange.

905
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Based on the current situation,

906
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
let's sort it out.

907
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
First,

908
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
suppose this is a disease.

909
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Sun Ming has been infected with this disease repeatedly.

910
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
And the characteristic of this disease

911
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
is that they are always violent.

912
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
They are not painful,

913
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
and they don't fear death.

914
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,840
We will temporarily call them crazy people.

915
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Second,

916
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
these crazy people don't attack each other.

917
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
They only attack those

918
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
who are not infected.

919
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Third,

920
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
as Xie Xiao said,

921
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
after they fell into the water,

922
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
they can't detect it.

923
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
And Zhu Shaosheng,

924
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
I suspect that someone is controlling those crazy people.

925
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Maybe.

926
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
But we haven't confirmed

927
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
if Zhu Shaosheng has any influence on the crazy people.

928
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Based on the information we have now,

929
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
the first question we have is

930
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
how these crazy people

931
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
can tell the enemy from me.

932
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
Based on the information Xie Xiao just provided,

933
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
these crazy people

934
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
can tell the same type

935
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
by smell.

936
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
They can tell the same type

937
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
by smell,

938
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
not by eyes.

939
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Smell?

940
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Many animals

941
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
can tell the same type

942
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
by smell.

943
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Direction,

944
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
shape,

945
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
or even touch.

946
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
So,

947
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
when Xie Xiao fell into the water,

948
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
these crazy people

949
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
stopped attacking him.

950
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
And as long as he comes out of the water,

951
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
everything will be fine.

952
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
It can be seen that

953
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
the water

954
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
covered the smell of Xie Xiao

955
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
and stopped the crazy people from attacking him.

956
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
So,

957
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
they stopped attacking each other

958
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
because of the smell.

959
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
What kind of smell is this?

960
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
This disease is very strange.

961
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
I've never heard of it.

962
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,840
I've never heard of it.

963
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
What's more strange is

964
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
in the dark village of the hidden city,

965
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
there are not only the Shi family

966
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
but also other people.

967
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,840
But the Shi family

968
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
doesn't know about this.

969
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
It's those pirates.

970
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Since we came up here,

971
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
we haven't seen them.

972
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
Now the rope is cut off.

973
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
This is not that simple.

974
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
Wait a minute.

975
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Pirates?

976
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
What pirates?

977
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Are they the pirates

978
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
I met last night

979
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
and the people who were sneaky?

980
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Good guy.

981
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
I haven't been in the city for a few days.

982
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
The pirates have already arrived in Yangzhou.

983
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Those bastards killed my brothers.

984
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
They are still hiding around here.

985
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
We can't get out of here.

986
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
I think these crazy people

987
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
must have something to do with the pirates.

988
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
They must have something to do with it.

989
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Think about it.

990
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
They have cut off the rope.

991
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
They don't want us to get out.

992
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
So

993
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
if this matter is not resolved,

994
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,840
we will die here.

995
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,840
I'm lost in thoughts.

996
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,840
The wind is howling.

997
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,840
My heart is blank.

998
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Thousands of miles of ambush come and go.

999
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,840
Who is born to be an outsider

1000
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,840
and can't compare with fate?

1001
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I can see your face when I close my eyes.

1002
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,840
When I open my eyes, I can see the cold in the back.

1003
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,840
The sword is full of sky.

1004
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Who has conquered the world?

1005
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,840
No sound.

1006
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,840
The secret is hidden.

1007
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
I...

1008
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
I...

1009
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,840

1012

I...

1013
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
I...

1014
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,840
I...

1015
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,840
I...

1016
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,840
I...

1017
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,840
I...

1018
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
I...

1019
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,840
I...

1020
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,840
I...

1021
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,840
I...

1022
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
I...

1023
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,840
I...

1024
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
I...

1025
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
I...

1026
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
I...

1027
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,840
I...

1028
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,840
I...

1029
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,840
I...

1030
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,840
I...

1031
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,840
I...

1032
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,840
I...

1033
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,840
I...

1034
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I...

1035
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
I...

1036
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,840
I...
