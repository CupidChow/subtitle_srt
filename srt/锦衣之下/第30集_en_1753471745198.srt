Now you really love me .

46
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,080
You finally give that love back.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,220
You finally give that love back.

48
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,260
I miss you.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,260
Do you love me?

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,000
Slut.

51
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,540
Almost lost ourosaic plans.

52
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,980
Grandmaster.

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,220
What's wrong?

54
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
I'm glad to be with you.

55
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,820
Nan Qingxuan.

56
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
So many things happened in Dan Qingge recently.

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,620
You're still interested in fishing here?

58
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Yes.

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,820
So many things happened.

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,420
I feel so peaceful.

61
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,820
It's strange.

62
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,020
Brother Lu.

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
Fish with me.

64
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
I'll treat you to fish.

65
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,420
Okay.

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
Fish with me.

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,620
I thought you treated me to live fish.

68
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,020
I'm a fisherman.

69
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Although I'm not afraid of being married,

70
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,020
I can't fish and eat by myself.

71
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,220
There's no hook in the fish with me.

72
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,820
There's no snake in the fishing rod.

73
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,620
What can I do with it?

74
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,020
Feel the water.

75
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,420
The river under the water?

76
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,420
I know my master.

77
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
He's been addicted to fishing for his whole life.

78
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,220
In order to pursue immortality,

79
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,420
he was instigated by others and was put into a trap.

80
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,620
That's why he lost his life because of a prescription.

81
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,420
Although I'm not good at politics,

82
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,420
I know the overall situation of the court.

83
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,020
If I guess it right,

84
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,620
his death with his brother

85
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,820
should be related to Yan's family.

86
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,820
In the next few days,

87
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,820
the Dali Temple will send people to investigate it.

88
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,020
I advise you

89
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,220
to keep it in your mind.

90
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,220
Don't get involved in it.

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,020
Brother Lu.

92
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,020
I have an unkind request.

93
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,620
I hope you can promise me.

94
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,820
Go ahead.

95
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,420
Dan Qingge

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,420
is in danger because of Yuan Ming.

97
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,820
But it's okay.

98
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,020
I'll prove it to Dan Qingge.

99
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,020
I'm willing to be the master of the fish

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,420
to help you move forward.

101
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,820
Lan Qingxuan.

102
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,220
You're so confident in yourself?

103
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
I have to do this

104
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,420
to deal with Yan.

105
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,700
If Bigvar is evil,

106
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,540
Your Majesty, how are you?

107
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,620
I'm alright!

108
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,940
I am fine!

109
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,020
Since Yuyuan汐 is dead early rounds,

110
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,540
I will guard our services until thecking times.

111
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,780
Very correctly.

112
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,160
Yuyuan has alibi for one years beforehand.

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,700
other than that, I have been routines ailment for a long time.

114
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,420
Why do you have to protect me?

115
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,580
Yan's forces are now in the court.

116
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,540
To shake them, we must make a deep effort.

117
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,300
His Majesty trusts Yan Ge.

118
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,900
As long as His Majesty still thinks of the benefactor

119
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,380
no one can defeat him.

120
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,540
But don't forget, Brother Lu.

121
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,420
His Majesty still respects the Dao Sect.

122
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,900
If you and I are together

123
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,220
maybe I can be your best assistant.

124
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,580
You want to enter the palace to gain His Majesty's trust?

125
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,620
If I can enter the palace and serve His Majesty

126
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,620
I can be your eyes in the palace.

127
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,900
I can't even protect myself from Yan's forces.

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,820
Let alone you.

129
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,100
I, Lan Qing Xuan, have no father or mother.

130
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,380
I have no father or mother.

131
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,180
Even if we are together, it's a pity.

132
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Lan Qing Xuan, why must you put yourself in danger?

133
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,380
The current situation is chaotic.

134
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,460
The right and wrong are always in conflict.

135
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,980
It's a big mistake.

136
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,820
There are some things that make the situation complicated.

137
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,900
His Majesty is suspicious.

138
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,900
We must find a suitable time.

139
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,300
Your Majesty, Eunuch Lu has found out

140
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,900
that there is a case of poison in the Dan Qing Pavilion.

141
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,820
According to the report, the poison that Master Yuan Ming made

142
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,900
is not poisonous.

143
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,820
It's because his disciples were greedy and secretly made the poison

144
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
that caused the dragon to be damaged.

145
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,700
Eunuch Lu has already arrested the suspect.

146
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
He has confessed.

147
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,820
Thank you, Father.

148
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,740
Inform Xu Ai Qing immediately

149
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,380
that the case of the poison has been investigated.

150
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,300
Ask Xu Ai Qing to solve it at his home.

151
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,900
Come to Yangxin Palace tomorrow to take the post.

152
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

153
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,460
Your Majesty, I have another matter.

154
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,060
Speak.

155
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,460
Your Majesty's body is the foundation of the country.

156
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,660
I would like to ask you to give me the medicine in the future

157
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,260
to prevent any accident.

158
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,460
I am really considerate.

159
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,060
I am very relieved.

160
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
I will take my leave.

161
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Give it to Master Yuan.

162
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,260
Yes.

163
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,980
Yun Waiter

164
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,660
You've finally returned.

165
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,660
Darong, please take care of Li Yun Zoe.

166
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,860
You be careful.

167
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,460
Ah Jun, you have to worry.

168
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,260
Yuan beginning to leave the Palace is easy to blame it on Master Yuan.

169
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,260
I am laughs.

170
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,060
No need for an excuse.

171
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,420
Remember to remember that I am already his trusted subject,

172
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,660
so don't say anything else.

173
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Andrew, Joer.

174
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,540
[? you don't know Joer when I'm not around. gooseism?

175
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,060
Yes.

176
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,860
Yuan Daxia.

177
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,060
Why didn't you tell me before you went back to Yangzhou?

178
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,780
It's not too late for you to know now.

179
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,700
Since you're going to Hangzhou,

180
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,020
I'll go with you.

181
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,820
I'll go wherever you go.

182
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,180
I'll be your shadow.

183
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,540
I'll follow you as you want.

184
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,700
Chief Xie.

185
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,020
You're not doing anything important.

186
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
It's important to follow Yuan Jinxia.

187
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,580
Xie Yuan, you're sick.

188
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,700
Don't follow me.

189
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,460
Xia Lan, we're leaving.

190
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,540
Take care.

191
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,420
Miss Yuan.

192
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,500
Happiness

193
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,900
sometimes needs to be held by ourselves.

194
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,380
What are you doing?

195
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,620
You really don't understand or you can't understand?

196
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,780
What do you mean?

197
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

198
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
Don't beat me.

199
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,500
Forget it.

200
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,700
Two fish in the pond.

201
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,060
I'll just mind my own business.

202
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,020
Sir Lu.

203
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,420
I'll see you later.

204
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,220
See you later.

205
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,780
See you later.

206
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,780
See you later.

207
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,380
Father.

208
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,180
Father.

209
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,180
I heard that you're testing the medicine for His Majesty

210
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,580
in the court today.

211
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,580
The news is spreading so fast.

212
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,100
Father.

213
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,020
Why did His Majesty suddenly want you to test the medicine for him?

214
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,340
It's not His Majesty who asked me to test the medicine for him.

215
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,740
It's me who took the initiative to treat His Majesty.

216
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,580
I should test the medicine for His Majesty.

217
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,340
Why?

218
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,820
There are imperial physicians in the palace.

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,580
Why do you have to do this?

220
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,740
There are three reasons.

221
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,340
One, as an official,

222
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,820
I should help His Majesty to solve the problem.

223
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,900
It's my duty.

224
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,900
Two, to consolidate the foundation of my family.

225
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,460
Three, the medicine I give to His Majesty

226
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,740
is good.

227
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,140
I don't need it.

228
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,300
Alright.

229
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,820
I'm glad you're happy.

230
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,700
But I want to remind you.

231
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,140
Don't regret it because of the medicine.

232
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
Lu Ting reported the case of Yuan Ming

233
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,460
in the court today.

234
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,380
It's a big problem for our family.

235
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,620
I feel relieved.

236
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,500
Xu Jing was not removed this time.

237
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,380
It's a pity.

238
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,100
There are many days ahead.

239
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,980
Fang Shi is dead anyway.

240
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,260
Lu Ting can't find any clues.

241
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,700
Xu Jing is not a big problem.

242
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,900
Er.

243
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,220
How do you treat Xu Jing?

244
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,900
What do you think?

245
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,860
After this,

246
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,780
Xu Jing might have some doubts.

247
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,380
We should be more careful.

248
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,260
His Majesty is suspicious.

249
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,380
Although he trusts us,

250
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,260
I'm afraid he might be suspicious.

251
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I think it's a good idea.

252
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,500
After we get in the city,

253
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,220
we should find a hotel to settle down.

254
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,180
This is the place where Zhezhe's Governor Wu Shouxu is.

255
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,980
It's not convenient for us to investigate him.

256
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,140
Ceng Feng.

257
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,780
Go to arrange a set of ordinary clothes for the civil servants.

258
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,420
Yes.

259
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,740
Get me a set of men's clothes.

260
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Since it's not convenient to appear as a government official,

261
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,460
I'm a girl.

262
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,020
It's not convenient for me to be with you guys.

263
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,060
Wear mine.

264
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,260
Thanks.

265
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,740
Hangzhou.

266
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,820
They say that the sun shines on the sky like a sun.

267
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,980
Sir, look.

268
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,340
The skin of these girls is really good.

269
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,260
Yuan Mokui.

270
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,740
We are here

271
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,620
not for the sake of the beauty.

272
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,980
Please accept my gift.

273
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,980
Jinxia.

274
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,220
Ignore him.

275
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,460
He's too easy.

276
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,220
Do whatever you want.

277
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,540
Even if the sky falls, I'll support you.

278
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,060
I'll support you.

279
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,580
Sir.

280
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,180
Then I have to squat down.

281
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,500
Jinxia.

282
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,020
Lanfang Shi.

283
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,980
Master.

284
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,020
You are here to find Miss Yuan and Young Master Xie, right?

285
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,620
Yes.

286
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,220
Yes.

287
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,460
You are late.

288
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,540
They have been gone for a while.

289
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,140
According to the plan,

290
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,020
they should be in Hangzhou soon.

291
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,460
Hangzhou?

292
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,700
Since the Danqing Pavilion is over,

293
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,420
they should go back to Yangzhou and meet us.

294
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,540
Why would they go to Hangzhou?

295
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,140
I'm not sure.

296
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,580
But if you hurry to find him...

297
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,260
Danqing Pavilion is not far from Hangzhou.

298
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,900
You guys go now.

299
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,900
You should arrive in two days.

300
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,500
Thank you.

301
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,340
Thank you, Master.

302
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,260
Why are you here?

303
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,540
I have something to say to you.

304
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,580
I need to chat with Shi heats.

305
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,660
She wants to see Shifu so badly.

306
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,460
Are we against love and respect in love?

307
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,740
Shi.

308
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,340
I'm coming out.

309
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,460
Ichikyo.

310
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
You serendipity.

311
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,380
You're only here to have some rest.

312
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm out.

313
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,180
See you.

314
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,420
I won't see you again.

315
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
inned.

316
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,180
I'll leave.

317
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,740
If we keep our distance,

318
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,780
you won't be annoyed if you can't see me.

319
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,260
As you wish.

320
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,540
It's time.

321
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,980
So handsome.

322
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,420
I have been

323
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,060
I haven't realized it before

324
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Qing Xiang, Lu Yi can't even smile.

325
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
What's there to look at? Look at me.

326
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
Move aside.

327
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Sir, you're dressed in this dress

328
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,540
with a very unique style.

329
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
With your appearance, the ladies of Hangzhou City

330
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,540
will be able to't even walk on the road when they see you.

331
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
What are you doing?

332
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,540
Sir, what I said is all true.

333
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,540
I can hear the sincere words of Yuan Bu Kui.

334
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
We're not going to Guan Yi today.

335
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
We don't want to expose our whereabouts.

336
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Don't call me sir anymore.

337
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Yes.

338
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
Lu Shisan.

339
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
Brother Lu.

340
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,540
I heard that the market in Hangzhou City is very lively.

341
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
Let's go and have a look.

342
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Since you're here, let's go and have a look.

343
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
Since you're here, let's go and have a look.

344
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Brother Yue, please.

345
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Brother Lu, please.

346
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,540
What do you think they're wearing?

347
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
This one looks better.

348
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,540
Madam, one please.

349
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,540
Come and sell the noisy stuff.

350
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Sell the noisy stuff.

351
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Noisy stuff.

352
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,540
Sir, buy a noisy stuff.

353
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
What is this called?

354
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,540
Noisy stuff.

355
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,540
I've never heard of it in Beijing.

356
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
This is Song's noisy stuff.

357
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
It's a year-end celebration.

358
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
It's more popular in the south.

359
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,540
But it's the time of the year.

360
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
It's still far from the New Year.

361
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,540
Sir, you don't know.

362
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Hangzhou City is the most lively.

363
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,540
The noisy stuff here is more popular every day.

364
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
Sir, one please.

365
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
No need.

366
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
I'll wear it.

367
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,540
Look, the fish and the bird are a pair.

368
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Because it's made of one piece of paper.

369
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,540
Fish?

370
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
One fish?

371
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,540
This is not an ordinary fish.

372
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,540
It's a fish that can fly.

373
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,540
It's called Kun.

374
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,540
I think that we always go to heaven and earth

375
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,540
when we play in the Yangzhou.

376
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,540
If it's possible,

377
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
I really want to be a fish that can fly.

378
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
You have a good eye.

379
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540
You know a lot.

380
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Of course.

381
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
But it's pretty good.

382
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,540
I'm a handsome young man.

383
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Didn't you say you'd give it to me?

384
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,540
No.

385
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
This is mine.

386
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540
This is mine.

387
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
I've already worn it.

388
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
I'll put it on for you.

389
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Give it back to me.

390
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
You're Lu.

391
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Give it back to me.

392
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Thank you.

393
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
This is for you.

394
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
Come on, I'll put it on for you.

395
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
I'm a big man.

396
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
Is it really good to have a little white rabbit on my head?

397
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Very good.

398
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Trust me.

399
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Really.

400
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Okay, then this one.

401
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,540
Cifu.

402
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
I let you pick one.

403
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Put it on.

404
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,540
Sir, I don't need it.

405
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
That's right.

406
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Put it on.

407
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
How fun it is.

408
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Here you are.

409
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Thank you, sirs.

410
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
Put it on.

411
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
It's time to play.

412
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
Go, go, go.

413
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
Play.

414
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
Miss,

415
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
we'd better go back early.

416
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
If master and madam know that we sneaked out,

417
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
they will scold us.

418
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
I rarely come out.

419
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,540
Don't be so weird.

420
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,540
Go over there.

421
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
Little man,

422
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
where are you going?

423
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Where are you, stupid rabbit?

424
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Stay away from my lady.

425
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
I'm talking to your lady.

426
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
Get out of the way.

427
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
Don't talk anymore. Let's go.

428
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Stop.

429
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Miss's maid is called Yuan Yang.

430
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Nice name.

431
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,540
What's your name, miss?

432
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
What do you want to do?

433
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
I don't want to do anything.

434
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
I just want to drink with you

435
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
in the spring breeze.

436
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
In the spring breeze.

437
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Enjoy.

438
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
Shameless.

439
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,540
You want to steal the girl under the bright sun?

440
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Look at the street.

441
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
There are many people who are blind now.

442
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,540
I'll see who dares to interfere with your business today.

443
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
How dare you?

444
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Do you know who is in front of you?

445
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
I know.

446
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
The beauty.

447
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
Don't worry.

448
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,540
My brothers like girls with bad temper.

449
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Let them play with you later.

450
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
Go away.

451
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
Let me go.

452
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,540
Let me go.

453
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Let me go.

454
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Yuan Yang.

455
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Miss.

456
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Let me go.

457
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Brother, look.

458
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
They are all looking at us.

459
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
I told you.

460
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
You must be looking for your father.

461
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,540
Brother,

462
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
you are right.

463
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
Go.

464
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
Look over there.

465
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
Let me go.

466
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Let me go.

467
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Let me go.

468
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
What's going on?

469
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
What are you doing?

470
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
Miss.

471
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Let me go.

472
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
Let me go.

473
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
How dare you?

474
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
Brothers, go.

475
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Why are you running?

476
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
I haven't hit enough.

477
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
Please spare my life.

478
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Please spare my life.

479
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
I'm not a man.

480
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
Please let me go.

481
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
Go.

482
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Apologize to her.

483
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Miss, I'm wrong.

484
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
I'm wrong.

485
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
I can't beg her.

486
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Please spare my life.

487
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,540
Please let me go.

488
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
I'm wrong.

489
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
I won't do it again.

490
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
I'm wrong.

491
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
I'm wrong.

492
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Go away.

493
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Childe.

494
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
Miss, are you okay?

495
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
I'm fine.

496
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm fine.

497
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
You may leave.

498
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
I'm fine.

499
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Go.

500
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
I'm fine.

501
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
You are battered.

502
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
I hope you won't blame yourself.

503
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Thank you, Childe.

504
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
Don't mention it.

505
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Liu Xiu.

506
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,300
Big brother.

507
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,540
Big brother.

508
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:08,940
Cousin.

509
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,740
Greetings, Miss Min.

510
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,700
She is your cousin?

511
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,460
Big brother, you know each other?

512
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,500
They are all my friends.

513
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,060
This time, they come to Hangzhou with me.

514
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,980
They are all martial artists.

515
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,580
Don't scare them.

516
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,060
What are you talking about?

517
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
Mr. Yuan saved me.

518
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,820
I'm so grateful.

519
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,180
By the way, big brother.

520
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,620
Last year,

521
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,780
I brought back jade powder and Qiangwei deer.

522
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,660
It's said that big brother prepared it.

523
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,780
I haven't found a chance to thank big brother.

524
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,420
Cousin, don't be polite.

525
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,900
I didn't expect that you have a cousin.

526
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,460
You are so considerate.

527
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,300
I didn't expect that.

528
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,740
Of course.

529
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,020
Our Miss is the daughter of Mr. Lu's big brother.

530
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,220
He means

531
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,660
her uncle is the father of this girl.

532
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,620
I know.

533
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,580
Big brother.

534
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,300
When did you come here?

535
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,700
Why didn't you inform us?

536
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,700
So we can welcome you here.

537
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,900
We just come here.

538
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,620
We don't want to disturb uncle's quiet.

539
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,660
You bring your maid here alone.

540
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,900
I think uncle and aunt must be worried about you.

541
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,100
Go back now.

542
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,340
Big brother, you know that

543
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,100
I don't go out often.

544
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,620
I finally get out and breathe fresh air.

545
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,740
I think you should go back now.

546
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,740
I will be happy to see you.

547
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,260
They dare not to talk to me when you are here.

548
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,500
Cousin, you are so considerate.

549
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,860
I don't know how to call you two.

550
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,260
Yuan Jinxia, nice to meet you.

551
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,660
Xie Xiao.

552
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,620
Mr. Yuan.

553
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,540
It's your cousin.

554
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,420
You go back with me.

555
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,060
You go back with me.

556
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,660
I must thank you for what happened today.

557
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,780
You are welcome.

558
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,580
You are my cousin.

559
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,860
Even if I don't do it,

560
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,460
you will help me.

561
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,580
Right, brother Lu?

562
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,900
Let's go, Mr. Yuan.

563
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,780
Big brother, please.

564
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:19,900
Please.

565
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,420
Madam, the lady is back.

566
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,980
Dad, mom.

567
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,420
Big brother, they are here.

568
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,340
You are back.

569
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,460
Yi.

570
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,820
Uncle, aunt.

571
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,860
Yi.

572
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,860
Come, sit down.

573
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,780
Come, sit down.

574
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,380
Come.

575
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,060
Mom, sit down.

576
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,700
Yi.

577
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,620
I heard from uncle Yuan

578
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,460
that a young hero saved my daughter.

579
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,460
Dad, it's Mr. Yuan.

580
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,620
Oh, it's a young hero.

581
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,220
You saved my daughter.

582
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,980
You are the benefactor of my family.

583
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,580
Yuan Ya, go to the account book and seal 100 taels of gold.

584
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,580
I must thank our little benefactor.

585
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,700
Yes.

586
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,420
You are so generous.

587
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,300
Uncle, you don't have to be polite to Yuan.

588
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,900
He is a man of the world.

589
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,500
He has done a lot of things that make people happy.

590
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
He never talks about money.

591
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,900
If you give him gold,

592
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,740
it's not appropriate.

593
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,660
It's appropriate.

594
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,460
Yes, yes, yes.

595
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,140
Brother Lu is right.

596
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,420
It's not appropriate to raise your hand.

597
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,380
Uncle, don't be polite.

598
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,940
My gold.

599
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,500
What's wrong with you, Ji Xia?

600
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,620
Are you feeling unwell?

601
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,580
My heart aches.

602
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,820
Mr. Yuan, what's wrong with you?

603
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,900
I'll ask Yuan Ya to find a doctor.

604
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,580
No need.

605
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,100
Miss Cheng Yi, no need.

606
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,700
It's okay.

607
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,420
Really?

608
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,180
No need.

609
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,260
No need for a doctor.

610
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,500
It's just a old disease.

611
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
It will be fine in a while.

612
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,940
It's really a pity for me.

613
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,180
Dad, mom.

614
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,700
Big brother and others are living in the Fenglai Inn in the city.

615
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,340
They are afraid of disturbing us.

616
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,980
Yi, this is your fault.

617
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,660
It's rare for me to see you.

618
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,300
How can I live outside?

619
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,460
Your aunt has already said it.

620
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,900
And we haven't seen each other for a long time.

621
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,180
You can stay in the house for a few days.

622
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,340
Uncle, aunt.

623
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,580
No need to bother.

624
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,980
No need to bother.

625
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,580
You can stay here.

626
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,940
I have to save your aunt some face.

627
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,060
Big brother, don't refuse.

628
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,380
I haven't heard you talk about the story of the capital for a long time.

629
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,180
You can stay here.

630
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,980
If so,

631
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,060
I'll obey your order.

632
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,460
Okay.

633
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,900
I'll take you to the horse farm tomorrow.

634
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,420
His Majesty is expanding the horse farm in the south.

635
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,740
He has provided military supplies.

636
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,140
Your father helped me to choose the horses in the court.

637
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,220
Our horse farm is also small.

638
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,340
Uncle, you are modest.

639
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,220
Your horse is well-fed.

640
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,860
Your father is just choosing some suitable officials and merchants

641
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,780
for the court.

642
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,900
Yi,

643
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,620
you should have two children this year, right?

644
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,860
Yes.

645
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,300
Yi,

646
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,620
your marriage is not fixed yet, right?

647
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,540
Aunt,

648
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,340
I'm not in a hurry.

649
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,820
How can you not be in a hurry?

650
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,340
You should get married first and then get married.

651
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,700
I have to help your father to make it clear.

652
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
Have you got married?

653
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,620
No.

654
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,500
But

655
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,820
you have to choose the head of the Lu family

656
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,100
carefully.

657
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,020
I'll help you to keep more attention.

658
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,300
Miss Chunyu.

659
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,220
I asked the servants to make the silver ear lotus seed soup for supper.

660
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,020
I thought Mr. Yuan would like it.

661
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,420
So I brought it to you.

662
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,780
How can you bring it here in person at this time of night?

663
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,900
Mr. Yuan, don't be so polite.

664
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,420
I asked Yuan Yang to send the silver ear lotus seed soup to all the guests.

665
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,180
I thought Mr. Yuan is my benefactor.

666
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
I can't be rude to him.

667
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,220
So I brought it here in person.

668
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,260
Since you are so kind,

669
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,940
I'll be flattered if I keep pushing you.

670
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,100
Thank you.

671
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,180
Please sit.

672
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,740
Drink it while it's hot.

673
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,620
The lotus seed is not dried yet.

674
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,420
It's warm and has a good color.

675
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,540
The lotus seed soup is very tender and thin.

676
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,780
Lotus seed is fragrant and sweet.

677
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,660
It's delicious.

678
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,140
Mr. Yuan, if you like it,

679
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,580
you can eat more.

680
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,140
I've prepared it in the kitchen.

681
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,260
Thank you, Miss Chunying.

682
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,100
Just call me Min'er.

683
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,340
Min'er.

684
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,380
By the way, you and Da...

685
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,700
You and Brother Lu,

686
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,780
have you grown up together?

687
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,220
Yes, but not really.

688
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,340
We often walked together when we were young.

689
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,740
I remember my uncle often brought my aunt and brother back to welcome us.

690
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,060
But since my aunt passed away,

691
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,860
we seldom walked together.

692
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,860
The last time I saw my brother was three years ago.

693
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,820
I see.

694
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,820
By the way,

695
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,220
I think Uncle and Aunt really appreciate you.

696
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,940
They might want to give you a family visit.

697
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,540
To be honest,

698
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,300
my mother really wants to marry me to my brother.

699
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,980
Mr. Yuan.

700
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,500
Miss Min'er, you scared me.

701
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,700
I mean I'm very happy for you.

702
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,460
Brother Lu is talented.

703
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,980
You're gentle and kind.

704
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,260
You're a good match.

705
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,020
No, no, no.

706
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,780
Mr. Yuan, don't misunderstand.

707
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,820
Although the marriage of a daughter

708
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,500
should be done in front of her parents,

709
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,420
but my parents have been loving me since I was a child.

710
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,220
They will definitely listen to my opinion.

711
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,380
What do you think?

712
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,540
I already have someone in my heart.

713
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,420
That person is not my brother.

714
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,020
I see.

715
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,940
Then I wish you a long-lasting wish.

716
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,700
And a happy marriage.

717
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,580
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

718
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,620
Miss, I think Mr. Yuan must have fallen in love with you.

719
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Miss, don't worry.

720
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,340
It's about your marriage.

721
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,940
Yangyang will not be distracted.

722
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,220
Since the wolf has feelings, the crab has wings.

723
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,420
As long as someone pushes it,

724
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,140
it will be done.

725
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,820
Take care, guys.

726
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,860
Min'er, it's been a long journey.

727
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,700
Drink some water.

728
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,500
Thank you.

729
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,260
Thank you.

730
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,020
Thank you.

731
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,780
Thank you.

732
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,540
Thank you.

733
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,300
Thank you.

734
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,060
Thank you.

735
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,860
Drink some water.

736
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,700
Take a break.

737
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,300
Be careful, it's hot.

738
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,380
Xiao'er.

739
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,300
Where is my two liang wine?

740
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Hurry up.

741
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,220
Coming.

742
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,620
Your wine.

743
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,220
Xiao'er.

744
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,340
Sir.

745
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,020
Sit here.

746
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,380
Come on, sit.

747
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,300
Have some tea.

748
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,220
Yuan.

749
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
You've had a long journey.

750
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,460
Take a break.

751
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,740
Okay.

752
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,140
Brother Yang.

753
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,700
Ling'er.

754
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,180
Ling'er.

755
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,180
You are Ling'er.

756
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,780
Brother Yang.

757
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,140
Is it really you?

758
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,500
Yes.

759
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,780
I almost can't recognize you.

760
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,260
You're still alive.

761
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,220
That's great.

762
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,220
You've changed a lot.

763
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,340
I almost can't recognize you.

764
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,140
Yes.

765
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,900
After all these years,

766
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm not the same as I was.

767
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
I can't recognize you.

768
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,060
I look ugly.

769
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,140
Be great,

770
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,820
I'll always work hard for you.

771
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,980
I'll work harder for you.

772
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,340
Thank you, Brother Yang.

773
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,860
Thank you Brother Ling'er.

774
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,900
Miss.

775
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,540
Miss equation.

776
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,020
Miss equation,

777
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,020
Be careful.

778
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,380
Back then,

779
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,660
I heard that you risked your life to assassinate Yan Shi Fan.

780
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,460
They all said that you were dead.

781
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,460
No, I'm not dead.

782
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,260
Senior saved me.

783
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,940
I went to the capital to find you.

784
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,340
I heard that you were locked in the prison and you were dead.

785
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,420
How did you get out?

786
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
I was lucky.

787
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,820
Although I saved my life and got out of the prison,

788
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,260
I broke my leg.

789
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
Your leg?

790
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
It's healed.

791
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,220
Now, I'm a constable at the Six Forts.

792
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,620
Although I'm not very important,

793
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,420
I'm not a victim.

794
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,340
Compared to that rebellious Yang Li,

795
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,180
I'm a different person.

796
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,660
By the way, Brother Yang,

797
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,740
do you have a son named Yang Yue?

798
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,740
You met Yue?

799
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
It's a coincidence.

800
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,460
I met him and Jin Xia.

801
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,060
They met you?

802
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,100
I also ate the moon cake Yang Yue made.

803
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,140
He mentioned your name.

804
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,900
I was wondering if it was you.

805
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,100
The world is big and people are different.

806
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,260
But if we can be together again,

807
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,460
our fate will be different.

808
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,380
Yes.

809
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,180
When we first met,

810
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,180
I was still very young.

811
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,580
I often played with you.

812
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,100
In order to keep an eye on me,

813
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,020
you often played with us.

814
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,660
I still remember that you always had a sachet on you.

815
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,740
You cherished it very much.

816
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,540
This sachet

817
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,900
looks like it was made by you.

818
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,780
It seems that you two were in love at that time.

819
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,500
I just don't understand.

820
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,700
What a pity.

821
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,580
I don't know who made the big deal

822
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,980
and made you marry Xia Changqing.

823
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,860
Back then,

824
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,300
I became a guard and changed my name to Yang Chengwan.

825
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,180
I was thinking

826
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,180
that I could protect you

827
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,420
by being a guard.

828
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,740
But I couldn't protect him.

829
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,940
That night,

830
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,620
I rushed to Xia's mansion.

831
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,340
His Majesty's imperial edict

832
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,060
had already arrived.

833
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,780
By the will of the heaven,

834
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,380
the emperor decreed that

835
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,820
Xia Ran should build a new county

836
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,700
and ignore the safety of the country

837
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,420
and let the people die.

838
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,500
In order to stop the bandits from invading our territory,

839
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,260
Xia Ran should be removed from the official position

840
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,860
and be sent to the government.

841
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,940
That's all.

842
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,900
I

843
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,180
accept the edict.

844
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,500
Master.

845
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,420
Let's go.

846
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:48,940
Father.

847
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,820
Master.

848
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,020
Father.

849
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,900
Father.

850
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Master.

851
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,060
Master.

852
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,380
Father.

853
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,620
Kill them.

854
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,500
Father.

855
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,220
Master.

856
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,220
Mother, be careful.

857
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,180
Mother.

858
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,940
Mother.

859
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
I don't want to.

860
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,780
Mother.

861
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,340
Mother.

862
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,300
Mother.

863
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,020
Mother.

864
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,940
Mother.

865
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,660
Mother.

866
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,500
Mother.

867
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,260
Mother.

868
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:34,980
Mother.

869
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,820
Brother Ya, just go.

870
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,660
Leave me alone.

871
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,780
I'll get you into trouble.

872
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,220
Go.

873
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,940
Xiao He.

874
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,460
No.

875
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,820
I must save you out.

876
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,020
Go.

877
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,860
Brother Ya.

878
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,060
Leave my daughter to Lian Er.

879
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,660
Go.

880
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:45,980
Leave me alone.

881
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,580
Mother.

882
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:46,940
Xiao He.

883
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,540
Stop.

884
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,980
Xiao He.

885
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,380
Xiao He.

886
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,580
Xiao He.

887
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,300
Almost.

888
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,780
Just almost.

889
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,020
Xiao He asked me to give you my daughter.

890
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,340
I didn't expect

891
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,100
I was caught on the spot

892
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,020
and put into the prison.

893
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
So you joined the prison to save your sister.

894
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,260
At that time,

895
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,660
Brother Ya accompanied me from the Medicine King Valley to the capital.

896
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,780
I saw the miserable state of the Xia family.

897
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,060
I was involved in the Lin family.

898
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,460
I was copied.

899
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,660
I went to revenge the Yan family.

900
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,220
I wanted to return to the capital with Yan Shi Fan.

901
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,180
Then Brother Ya stopped me and saved me.

902
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,580
Otherwise,

903
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,460
there would be no Yan Shi Fan in this world.

904
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,500
And no Ling Ling.

905
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,420
Wait.

906
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,100
Why did you turn away when you saw me?

907
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,540
You...

908
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,300
You don't want to see me, do you?

909
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,060
You don't have to hide from me.

910
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,020
I'm afraid you'll hate me.

911
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,300
So I...

912
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,820
Since you're here to find Miss Yuan,

913
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,180
I'm here to find Xie Xiao.

914
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,900
Let's go together.

915
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,420
Okay.

916
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:23,900
I...

917
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,740
I'll do it.

918
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,420
I'll do it.

919
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,260
You left Feng Lin Ao.

920
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,420
What's your plan?

921
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,300
I don't know.

922
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,820
I met Jin Xia and others a few days ago.

923
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,540
I have a vague concern.

924
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,260
Brother Yang.

925
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,180
Do you know where my sister's child is now?

926
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,860
Is she still alive in this world?

927
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,460
I left Zhaoyu

928
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,740
and investigated this matter for a long time.

929
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,220
Back then,

930
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,860
your sister asked me to take the child to watch the lanterns.

931
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,060
Unexpectedly,

932
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,300
she died when she got home that night.

933
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,820
The child I took

934
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,700
also disappeared at the same time.

935
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,820
I found out

936
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,780
that the child was taken away by a human trafficker

937
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,740
and brought to Jiangnan.

938
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,740
But

939
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,340
the trafficker took the child

940
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,660
to the way of Halun and did a sangre,

941
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,620
led her to the fire ohm.

942
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,780
Did you mean

943
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,860
this child is still alive?

944
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,220
Where is she now?

945
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
I was wrong.

946
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,340
The wind howls, my body shakes.

947
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,340
My heart is blank.

948
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,340
A thousand miles of ambush comes.

949
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,340
Who is out of the city?

950
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,340
I can't beat the fate.

951
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:20,340
I close my eyes and I can see your face.

952
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,340
Open your eyes and see the cold scenery.

953
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,340
The sword is full of sky.

954
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,340
Who is out of the city?

955
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:38,340
No sound, the dark cloud rises.

956
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,340
The fate turns.

957
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,340
See the change in the world.

958
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,340
I want to say goodbye.

959
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,340
Goodbye is too sad.

960
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,340
I miss you.

961
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,340
The golden leaf.

962
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,340
I met you.

963
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,340
The day you wrote the white hair.

964
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,340
We spent the years together.

965
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:17,340
I will see you in my dream.

966
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:47,340
The End
