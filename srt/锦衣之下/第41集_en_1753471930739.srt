2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ah

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This knife is used by the martial arts master

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
To hide his body

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And is used for the purpose of the unknown

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't have it

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Who gave it to you?

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Speak! Who gave it to you?

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You want to know?

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll tell you

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yan Shifan

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yan Shifan?

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What? Are you afraid?

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yan Shifan

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not surprised that he wants to kill me

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But have you ever thought about it?

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If he really wants to kill me

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He can just find a killer

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why would he want to find a martial artist

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who doesn't know how to fight?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because you are Lord Lu's cousin

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Whether you kill me or not

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You will be distracted by the military camp

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If he leaves the military camp

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He will violate the royal camp

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is the purpose of Yan Shifan

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't care about that

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
As long as I can live

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can kill anyone

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Even if I kill my big brother

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will do it

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you know what you are talking about?

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Your big brother is your only family now

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He is the only one who is good to you

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You almost made me marry Sima Chang'an

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He didn't blame you

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Your Chunyu family had an accident

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He took you in

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are not worthy of him

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can pretend that

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This didn't happen today

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can not blame you

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And I don't hate you

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I hope

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can think about

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How you should go in the future

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
People still have a breath

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Life is yours

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Of course

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you want to kill me again

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will do it

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But next time

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I won't be so polite

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's go

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Go

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Go

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Go

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Go

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
General

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
General

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
To be honest

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have studied the war records for half a year

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I know the location of this Ceng Gang

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I have calculated the consumption of gunpowder of several war camps

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
According to my calculations

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The supply of gunpowder in Ceng Gang

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is not enough to support Mao Haifeng

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He has fought for so long

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What do you mean?

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Mao Haifeng must have a way to transport gunpowder

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Otherwise, this Ceng Gang

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mao Haifeng has no external source

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But he still has no water and food

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Even the gunpowder is not short-lived

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
General

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't you think there is something wrong?

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When I first arrived in Zhou Shan

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have thought about this

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I have fully arranged the defense line

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And cut off the Japanese and Western routes

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All the routes

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have sent troops to block them

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
All the roads

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
As long as they can be used for the case

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They are under our supervision

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And there is no ship

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Which can secretly send the supplies to Ceng Gang

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In fact

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Just a few months ago

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have fought with Mao Haifeng in Yangzhou

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But at that time

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Everyone thought Mao Haifeng was in Ceng Gang

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I once suspected that

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There is a secret passage between the mountains

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Which connects the secret passage of Mao Haifeng's band

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It seems to be true

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
General Yu

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mr. Lu

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
General Qi

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You asked me to wait for the clue yesterday

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's your idea?

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I plan to send small troops every day

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
To call the enemy

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Our army will not move

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So that Mao Haifeng thinks

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Our army is not going to fight

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You mean stop the battle?

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
General Qi wants to use the plan to control the situation

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
To reduce the alertness of Mao Haifeng

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then find a chance

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now this is a way

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But the emperor is very strict

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you use this way

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Then let people have a chance

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
To participate in the emperor's meeting

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is not just

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
To withdraw the order and investigate

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I understand what you mean

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
General, don't worry

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
After I go back to the capital

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will definitely report to the emperor

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How can I believe

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Mr. Lu can speak for us in front of the emperor?

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Such a small thing

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's not my character

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Besides

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have no conflict with the general

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I have no reason to fight on the battlefield

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What I report is also the truth

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We are all the people of the Ming Dynasty

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We should unite to fight against the enemy

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If those ministers

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Can have the same belief as Lu Qianshi

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
General Yu and we

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Will not fight so hard

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
General

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
General, you are here

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Master

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Xianer

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's wrong with you?

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Nothing

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I met pirates on the way

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They cut me

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fortunately, I have checked

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The wound is not fatal

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So I sent my father back to recuperate

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am sorry

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I am sorry

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I am sorry

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I am sorry

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am sorry

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I am sorry

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I am sorry

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am sorry

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you know that

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have been worried about you these days?

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I locked myself in the room

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I didn't eat or drink for days

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Father

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I am sorry

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I am sorry

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's ok

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's all over

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Master, have a good rest

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ok

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Come out

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What? Why did you hit me?

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I hit you for myself

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I promised master

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
As long as you come back

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No matter how he punishes you

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I won't speak for you

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But master didn't punish you

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So I have to do it myself

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do you think you should hit me?

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes, yes, yes

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hit me, hit me

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Your wound is much better

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The doctor said

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you go home several times

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You may recover

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Really?

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He is so good

207
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
By the way, Jinxia

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Aunt Lin prescribed a prescription for father

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You go to take care of father

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will go to the pharmacy to get the medicine

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Come back, come back

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You are tired

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You go to accompany master

214
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will go

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
She is considerate

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Come, come, come

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Jinxia

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's this?

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Look

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Huang Mazi

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why does he appear here?

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How about this?

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Try this

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Try this

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is good

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is cheap

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Try this

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is a pastry

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You try

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
My pastry is very sweet

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's sweet and sweet

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's sweet and sweet

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's crispy

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can't eat it for two days

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you want?

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Miss

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Come

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is delicious

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Boss

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I want to go to the General's mansion in the east of the city

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This road is closer

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This road is going to Qingbo River

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you go to the General's mansion

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You will go far away

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Qingbo River

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
By the way

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I want to buy fish

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When does the fish market start?

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Where?

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Fish market

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Follow this road

252
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can see the fish market in the east

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you want to buy fish

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You should start early

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The fish market here

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Starts at the beginning of the month

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It will be sold out before the morning

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't catch up today

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How about you come here?

260
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, no, boss

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have something to do

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I wish you a good business

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Ok, ok, ok

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
See you

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Miss, have a try

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is our General Yu

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
General Yu

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I am Shangguan Xi

269
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is my junior Xie Xiao

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We are the disciples of the Southern Shaolin Temple

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We are here to help you

272
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
To fight against the pirates

273
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you

274
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I am very grateful

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You are welcome

276
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Those pirates are on the land of Ming

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They are violent

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They are the people

279
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They are evil

280
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They will be in peace if they don't get rid of the coastal area

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Now everyone wants to make a contribution

282
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We should drive them out

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Be careful in front of the general

284
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's ok

285
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sir Lu

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Miss Shangguan

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What's up? You know each other?

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes, general

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Kid

290
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Here comes the book

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
General

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
These two are the two doctors I mentioned to you before

293
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Thank you for coming

294
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I heard you are here to save the wounded

295
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes

296
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
My junior and I have been working in the medicine valley for decades

297
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's no problem to save the wounded

298
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Great

299
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Many soldiers are seriously injured

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's good that you are here

301
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We can't delay the matter of the people's life

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Please

303
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Kid, take the two doctors to Shangming Camp

304
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, sir

305
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Ok, you talk first

306
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Ok

307
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You are here at the right time

308
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's time

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We should discuss the battle with the pirates

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We should attack them in two ways

311
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The Shaolin monks are good at fighting

312
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Who said that?

313
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My water quality is top-class

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No one can compete with the whole Wu'an Gang

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Besides

316
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Even if we attack from the sea

317
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The water quality is not good

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You mean you have a better idea

319
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I have an idea

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But I have to lose a warship

321
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We are not brave enough to lose a warship

323
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I am afraid I can't take the responsibility

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Unless

325
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Unless this method works

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We can defeat them in one move

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Do you remember the ghost ship you met when you first came to Yangzhou?

328
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Ghost ship?

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Your masterpiece

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Of course

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I am not only good at water quality

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But also good at woodworking

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you remember

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
When your warship was approaching the ghost ship

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You were out of control

336
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I remember

337
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You put the magnet around the turntable

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Use the magnet to make the turntable

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Use the magnetic force to absorb the current

340
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So the current can't control the direction

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You know a lot

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What do you want to do?

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We can change the design of the warship according to the design of the ghost ship

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Put the water thunder under the deck of the warship

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Become a super thunder bullet

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Then let the warship approach the ship

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And take the warship out of the port

348
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then when we meet them

349
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We will make a water thunder

350
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
All the warships will be destroyed

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's a feasible plan

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But it's too dangerous

354
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes

355
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If the pirates don't go to the port

356
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The time to make a water thunder is not right

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Any mistake can cause failure

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Lu, what do you think?

359
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think it's ok

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
According to our original plan

361
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Pretend to surrender

362
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Reduce the attention of the pirates

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Before the ship arrives

364
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They will go out of the port to check

365
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
To make a big deal

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They will go out together

367
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
As long as we catch the time to make a water thunder

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We can make a big deal

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
To catch all the ships

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But Lu

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The problem is we don't have the thunder and fire

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Then we can only put the gunpowder in the ship

373
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No

374
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The person who wants to make a thunder will die

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Give me the water thunder

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Ten days

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Can you fix the ship?

378
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Can you?

379
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Since you want to make a water thunder

380
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can help you

381
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Ok

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
General Qi is good at fire

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If you can help him

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The water thunder will be more effective

385
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I will leave the ship and the water thunder to you

386
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No problem

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What's wrong?

388
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I met someone

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Who?

390
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
A pirate

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
His name is Wang Mazi

392
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you sure he is a pirate?

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We met in Longdan village

394
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Wang Mazi

395
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Later, when I went to find my body

396
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I found a village

397
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He is in it

398
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
How did you find here?

399
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Did the soldiers bring it?

400
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But later the soldiers went to check

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And he was gone

402
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He is here

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's not that simple

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
In my opinion

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We should report to Mr. Wu as soon as possible

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is his territory

407
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It should be easy to find him

408
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But we are not sure

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I am afraid Mr. Wu won't believe us

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think we should figure out

411
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
His purpose of coming to Hangzhou

412
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Then we can make a plan

413
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I saw a fishing rod in his hand

414
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think his residence should be not far from the city

415
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Then we should go to find him

416
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No need

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We will go to the fishing market by Qingbo river tomorrow

418
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He should be there

419
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Why?

420
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
When he passed by me today

421
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I smelled a strong fishy smell

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And he has fish scales on his blood

423
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
More than one kind of fish scales

424
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think he should be in the fishing market

425
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I have asked around

426
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The fishing market is near Qingbo river

427
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
By the way

428
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He has a wave drum in his hand

429
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Wave drum?

430
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Does he still have a wife and children?

431
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I think so

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So he is trying to hide the truth

433
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I think he is trying to hide the truth

434
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Maybe

435
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He is trying to get back the evidence

436
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And he is far from the pirates

437
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If he really wants to get back the evidence

438
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He should take his wife and children

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And leave the city

440
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Right

441
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Then what is his purpose of hiding here?

442
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We will know when we find out

443
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Brother

444
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You were in the Medicine King Valley

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You were so interested in it

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And you like to study poison

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
How many times have you made him angry?

448
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
If he sees you now

449
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He will be so angry

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I will go to find him

451
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Brother

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You are so good at it

453
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I have never seen you like this

454
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I have never seen you like this

455
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I have never seen you like this

456
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Brother

457
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I have never seen you like this

458
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He sees you now

459
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He is so serious about treating the wounds

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I think he will be very comforted

461
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Ling'er

462
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you ok today?

463
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You can't laugh at me like this

464
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not a joke

465
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think you have changed

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Ling'er

467
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
In the past

468
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I was so naughty

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I wanted to get your feet

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But now I know

471
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
As long as you can be safe

472
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I will do everything

473
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's not like what you said

474
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I know

475
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I know

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I know

477
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I know

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I know

479
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I know

480
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What you said

481
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You don't know

482
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If it wasn't because

483
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Lu Yi was poisoned

484
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I wouldn't have bothered you

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Since you came out of the honey

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have been so worried every day

487
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was afraid you would be caught by Yan Shifan

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't expect

489
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I was so worried every day

490
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I almost

491
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This time

492
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Although I was lucky to avoid Yan Shifan

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I still didn't find

494
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
my sister's daughter

495
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is my worry

496
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Anyway

497
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I must find her

498
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Ling'er

499
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Don't worry

500
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
After the battle

501
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
As long as you find her

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I will be with you

503
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Tomoko

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You are back

505
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm back

506
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Welcome back

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Dad will be back

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
How are you today?

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I hope you can trust me

510
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Come on

511
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's okay

512
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Mom is here

513
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Dayou

514
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Wait

515
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Take this

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Mohan medicine

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Why do you give me this?

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Wang Mazi is a thief

519
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You are too honest

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm afraid you can't handle it

521
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you find he starts to suspect you

522
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You can use this to make him dizzy

523
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Then he will run away

524
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Of course

525
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's better to let him know

526
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't worry

527
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Be careful

528
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I will be back

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Mom

530
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Mom

531
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm back

532
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
There is a corpse on the wall

533
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It should be put on recently

534
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The ashes are not dried yet

535
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It must be very important

536
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It can't be seen

537
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So the room is next to the bed

538
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
If someone is outside

539
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
They can hear it

540
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Mom

541
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Don't worry

542
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I will take a look

543
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Take this to the bathroom

544
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's open now

545
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay

546
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Brother

547
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
We just caught a little

548
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Everyone caught a whole boat

549
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We have been busy all night

550
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We are not in a hurry

551
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
We are not in a hurry

552
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We are not in a hurry

553
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We are not in a hurry

554
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We are not in a hurry

555
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We have been busy all night

556
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Can we make money?

557
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Can we make money?

558
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Not enough money?

559
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We should talk to the boat owner

560
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
We should talk to the boat owner

561
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't mean that

562
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm quite good with you

563
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm just curious

564
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
how they do it

565
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I just came here

566
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm not familiar with it

567
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I am more

568
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
powerful than them

569
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Do you want to know how to catch so many fish?

570
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know either.

571
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
Go. Let's start.

572
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,400
Okay.

573
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
You're going to be in jail.

574
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't let the fish fall.

575
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
Don't worry.

576
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,800
Let me see the fish in the cage.

577
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,200
Look at that person.

578
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
There's a big one on my boat.

579
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,800
Let me see.

580
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,400
I'll go.

581
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,400
There's fish!

582
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Hungry? Want to eat?

583
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,000
Let's get down to business. I'll cook for you.

584
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,800
Yes, yes, yes. What did you find out?

585
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,600
I found something very strange.

586
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,960
This Wang Mazi didn't seem to focus on fishing all night.

587
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
It was almost dawn.

588
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,320
There was a boat on the opposite side.

589
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,880
There was a light on the boat.

590
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,200
The boatman was dancing with the light on.

591
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,920
He was spinning in a circle.

592
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
I thought it was strange at that time.

593
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,080
But you can only pretend not to notice.

594
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,400
After that, Wang Mazi took the light and did the same action.

595
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,200
Then the boat left.

596
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,200
Isn't it strange?

597
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
This must be some kind of secret code.

598
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,680
You're thinking about it.

599
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,760
No matter what the secret code is,

600
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,800
don't think about it so much.

601
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,240
I'll go and make a fish for you.

602
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,800
Wait until we fill our stomachs and think about it.

603
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,480
The gray dance light is spinning.

604
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,800
What does it mean?

605
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,800
What does it mean?

606
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Let's think about it after we're full.

607
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,520
Dairou, I'm so hungry.

608
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
Everyone, speed up.

609
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,960
It's not far from the teaching day.

610
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,800
Okay.

611
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
Come on, lift this up and take a look.

612
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:48,960
Speed up.

613
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,080
Be careful.

614
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,680
Be careful.

615
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,360
Come on.

616
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:54,760
It's still stable.

617
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,680
Take a picture and let them sit in line.

618
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,560
Okay.

619
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,640
Come on, I'll put it here.

620
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,320
I said, Lu.

621
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,040
You either go away.

622
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,800
Or don't just stand here and look.

623
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,960
You can't even do it with your hands.

624
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,400
I can't.

625
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,560
If you can't, then just stay where you are.

626
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,120
Don't act like a supervisor.

627
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,360
What?

628
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
I can cut the material with my head?

629
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,840
That's not necessary.

630
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,480
You sit here.

631
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,400
Where's your water mine?

632
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,280
Don't make people laugh if you can't get it out.

633
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,640
Don't worry about my business.

634
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,080
Just do your job well.

635
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,560
You don't have to worry about my business.

636
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,520
Let me tell you.

637
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,920
Just do your job.

638
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,160
Don't bother me.

639
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,080
Did I bother you?

640
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,760
You're doing it wrong.

641
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,520
Move aside.

642
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,080
See?

643
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,160
It's a signal.

644
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,400
I know it.

645
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
What is this thing?

646
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,280
How to get it by carriage?

647
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,560
They're full of fire.

648
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,760
Fire?

649
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,920
What do they want?

650
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,040
You help the pirates with so many fire.

651
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,320
It's not good.

652
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,920
Easy.

653
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,880
Let's go.

654
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,120
Where are you going?

655
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,680
Catch them.

656
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,320
Or we'll wait for them to run away.

657
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,640
What?

658
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
How can we catch them?

659
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,360
You don't know how many people they have.

660
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,400
And so many fire.

661
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,800
If we really get them,

662
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,960
we won't win.

663
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,800
If we fail,

664
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,160
we might lose our lives.

665
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,880
What should we do?

666
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,040
The ship is leaving.

667
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,520
Go.

668
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,400
Let's go down now.

669
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
And catch that bastard.

670
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Don't worry.

671
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,880
You've been with him for so many years.

672
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,800
Don't you know I always catch people by this way?

673
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,960
He can't run away.

674
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,360
Catch people by this way?

675
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,160
Yang Mu Yu took his head away.

676
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,840
Go.

677
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,840
Go.

678
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,640
Mr. Xia.

679
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,360
You've been thinking about it all the way.

680
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,880
Have you thought of a way?

681
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,000
Of course.

682
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,640
Then go catch them.

683
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,160
Go.

684
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,320
Why are you in a hurry?

685
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,520
You can't run away from the temple.

686
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,320
You have to choose a good time to do it.

687
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,280
Well...

688
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
Here, have some tea.

689
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,880
Okay.

690
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,560
Report.

691
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,280
What's up?

692
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,040
General, a scout reported that

693
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,760
a group of bandits moved to Cen Gou.

694
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
They will arrive in five days.

695
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,640
How many people?

696
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,880
About 400 to 500 people.

697
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,280
Any fire?

698
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,360
No idea.

699
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,200
Keep investigating.

700
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,440
Report if you have any situation.

701
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,080
Yes.

702
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,520
It seems that the pirates can't hold on.

703
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,200
They want to attack us from the inside and outside.

704
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,880
They want to defeat us.

705
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,280
It's not enough to have hundreds of people come.

706
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,200
But under the pressure of the emperor's seven lines,

707
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,400
people are in panic.

708
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,520
If these two bandits meet,

709
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,600
it will be the last straw to crush our army.

710
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Maybe the crisis is the turn of the tide.

711
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,600
Xie Xiao.

712
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,520
How many days to the ship?

713
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,200
It's five days ahead of the current progress.

714
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,240
No.

715
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,800
If the reinforcements of the Japanese are arrived within five days,

716
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,280
our plan will also change.

717
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,240
You only have three days now.

718
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
Can you finish it within three days?

719
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,080
You test me so much.

720
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,400
How can I say no?

721
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,880
I will help him.

722
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,080
I will finish it within three days.

723
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,720
Be careful outside.

724
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,680
I know.

725
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,440
Follow them.

726
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,280
My target is him.

727
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,800
What does it have to do with Wang Mazi's wife?

728
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,160
Wang Mazi is hiding the fire weapon.

729
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,280
How can he be fine?

730
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,680
But it's not enough to catch the bad guys.

731
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,360
We six gates catch the bad guys.

732
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,760
We never harm others.

733
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,160
I also know that this method is a little bit clumsy.

734
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,760
It's not like the way I do it.

735
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,280
But it's special.

736
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,360
It can only be like this.

737
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,880
Who are you?

738
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,680
You are Wang Mazi's maid.

739
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:46,640
We are the

740
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
I didn't expect that she married a person from the East.

741
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,400
But you don't know it's fake.

742
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,720
Let's go in and see.

743
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm sorry.

744
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,240
What?

745
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,480
I'm sorry.

746
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,120
What are you going to do?

747
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,040
Did we make a mistake?

748
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,680
What's the hurry?

749
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,680
There is another box.

750
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
This box can't be opened.

751
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,440
Master said that.

752
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,080
You?

753
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Move.

754
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,720
This box can't be opened.

755
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,360
So many fire weapons.

756
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,880
Dayang.

757
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,800
Take all the things away.

758
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,920
Master,

759
00:35:59,480 --> 00:35:59,880
Yesterday,

760
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
We deliveredod artifacts to cook prayers

761
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,440
We have twenty-five of them,

762
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,400
And a heavenly hole.

763
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,880
There are eighteen mines.

764
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
Overall, the horses of fire are-

765
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,340
restaurants a

766
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,880
Master.

767
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,340
The Javelin was momento

768
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,040
Retreat?

769
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,080
They are afraid.

770
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,080
Master,

771
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,720
Should we by all means.

772
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,800
Kill them?

773
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,840
No need.

774
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,120
Guards.

775
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,880
Let's go back.

776
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Well...

777
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
I don't understand.

778
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,960
The people's army is being beaten by us

779
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,240
without any advantage.

780
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,840
Well...

781
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Learn to be patient.

782
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,040
When all our plans are arranged,

783
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,040
we can beat them again.

784
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
You're so wise, Chief.

785
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,320
Go tell Wang Mazi

786
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,400
to arrange everything

787
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,520
and wait for my order.

788
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,400
Yes, sir.

789
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,760
I'll go right away.

790
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,920
Wu Shouxu, Wu Shouxu.

791
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,840
You'll never expect

792
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,840
I have this trick.

793
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,000
Hello.

794
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,720
We have something important to see you.

795
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Can you tell us?

796
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,760
I'm sorry, sir.

797
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,560
My master has received the imperial edict.

798
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,280
He went to Cen Gang a few days ago.

799
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,080
What a coincidence.

800
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,960
What should we do?

801
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,160
Do you have any emergency?

802
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,800
Sir,

803
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,480
do you know

804
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,920
who knows Dongying dialect in Hangzhou?

805
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,160
Dongying dialect?

806
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,120
I don't know about others.

807
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,560
I only know that

808
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,000
Mrs. Qi knows Dongying dialect.

809
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,920
Mrs. Qi?

810
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,880
Yes.

811
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
She's the wife of Qi Weigang,

812
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,040
from Wang family.

813
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,480
Thank you, sir.

814
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,040
Goodbye.

815
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,120
See you.

816
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,200
Why is it so long?

817
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,880
Come on.

818
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
How is it, miss?

819
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,720
Are you from Lushan Sect?

820
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,480
Yes.

821
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,400
Show me your token.

822
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,520
Follow me.

823
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,560
The maid is so polite.

824
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,800
I think Mrs. Qi is not easy.

825
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,560
You're right.

826
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,440
Let's go.

827
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,520
Madam, someone is here.

828
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,160
Mrs. Qi.

829
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Check it for me.

830
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,040
Yes, madam.

831
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,920
Thank you, madam.

832
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
I heard that general Qi is a master of formation.

833
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,560
The Yangtze River and Langxian

834
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,760
are necessary weapons, right?

835
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,080
You know general is good at formation in the capital.

836
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:42,880
Yes.

837
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,040
My head

838
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,120
favors general Qi's formation.

839
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,880
He told us

840
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,080
many changes in it.

841
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,080
For example, the five-shaped formation

842
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,760
used in the general battle

843
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,200
and the three-talented formation

844
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,920
used for the pursuit.

845
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,360
I heard you're from Lushan Sect.

846
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,120
What's the matter?

847
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,080
I heard that Mrs. Qi is good at form.

848
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,600
We have a favor to ask.

849
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,920
General Yu.

850
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,800
You must have received

851
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
another imperial edict

852
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
to exempt us from

853
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,600
the imperial edict.

854
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,160
Yes.

855
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,680
His Majesty also said

856
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,760
he would not pursue the case for now.

857
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,440
His Majesty is really anxious this time.

858
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,120
He even pursued the imperial edict

859
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,960
for less than a month

860
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,040
before he was released.

861
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,200
If we fail to attack Cenggang again,

862
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,760
I and general Yu's head

863
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,800
will be lost.

864
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,720
I'm worried about

865
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,000
your concern.

866
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
The reason for the failure

867
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,360
is the complicated geographical environment.

868
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,880
Mao Haifeng has been hiding.

869
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,240
Although we have been

870
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,680
trapping the bandits for a long time,

871
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,360
we have some reinforcements.

872
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,560
Before you come,

873
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,040
we have decided

874
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,520
to fight with the bandits.

875
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,480
You're so clever.

876
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,520
You've got so many

877
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,160
black fire medicine.

878
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
How can we do without them?

879
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,720
The water thunder

880
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
opened my eyes.

881
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,200
Don't touch it.

882
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,280
It's okay.

883
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,400
What's the big deal?

884
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,760
But, Lu,

885
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
you were the supervisor

886
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,520
when I changed the ship.

887
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,320
I told you to help me.

888
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,240
You said you couldn't.

889
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,080
But you're good at it.

890
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,480
It's different.

891
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,520
You're just a rough man.

892
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,400
What's the use of the cowhide bag?

893
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,720
To prevent the hidden heart from being teased.

894
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,240
The cowhide bag is not water-proof.

895
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,160
Why didn't I think of this?

896
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,360
Only a guard like you

897
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,600
can think of this.

898
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
The fire is very dangerous.

899
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,760
If you're not careful,

900
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,800
it will be a big trouble.

901
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,400
Xie Xiang,

902
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,560
follow me to check the ship.

903
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,520
Don't be a nuisance here.

904
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,440
Don't be a nuisance.

905
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,520
What are you doing in the water?

906
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
What's the purpose of the water?

907
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,480
Why are you here?

908
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,440
Master goes fishing every day.

909
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
He works as a fisherman.

910
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,160
A fisherman?

911
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,840
Then,

912
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,800
where did you get the oysters

913
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,640
from?

914
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,320
What do you mean?

915
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm sorry.

916
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,160
I really don't know.

917
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,640
The owner of the box

918
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,000
was the one who took it home the other day.

919
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,080
He told me not to touch it.

920
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,200
I didn't see the contents of the box.

921
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,400
I really didn't know

922
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,480
the oysters were in it.

923
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,920
Master,

924
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,720
you're a man.

925
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,600
What are you doing?

926
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,240
What's wrong?

927
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,760
Are you okay?

928
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:21,280
Master goes fishing every day

929
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,840
and comes back when he sells out the fish.

930
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
I don't

931
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,720
listen to the work.

932
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,400
I see.

933
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,840
Is that so?

934
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
You're hungry, right?

935
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,200
I'll make you some food.

936
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,440
My lady,

937
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,040
please.

938
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,480
Let me and Sadoko go home.

939
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,320
She's begging you to let them go.

940
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,240
My lady,

941
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,040
does she know where the oysters are from?

942
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
It's okay.

943
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,680
She knows nothing.

944
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,400
She doesn't even know what her husband does.

945
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,560
Guards,

946
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,480
take her to rest.

947
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,720
Yes.

948
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,240
Please.

949
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,400
Hey, Thomas.

950
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,680
Take a rest.

951
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,840
I'm leaving.

952
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm leaving.

953
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,440
How could she

954
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,920
not know what her husband does?

955
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,080
It's the tradition of the Eastern Yang people.

956
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,320
Women can't ask what men do.

957
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,600
The rain falls, I'm lost.

958
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,560
My mind is messed up.

959
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,280
The wind blows, I'm shocked.

00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,320
My heart is blank.

961
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,600
Thousands of miles of ambush come and go.

962
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,200
Who is out of the city

963
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,640
can't compare to fate.

964
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,280
Cities crews are in battle every day

I've seen through the changes in life.

975
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,880
It's like saying goodbye.

976
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,880
It's too sad to say goodbye.

977
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,880
I remember the day

00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,880
when I met you.

979
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,880
My hair was grey from the rain.

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,880
We spent our years together.

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,880
In the dream, we talked for years.
