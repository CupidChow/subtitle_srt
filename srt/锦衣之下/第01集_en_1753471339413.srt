YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeats are still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separated by two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Since then, the father of Yansun has been in power

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jiajing 37 years

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The pirates who were led by Wang Zhi

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Cleared the city of Yanhai in the Ming Dynasty

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
At the same year

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The military department of the Yanhai Department of Defense lost its morale

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The guard commander Lu Ting's son Lu Yi

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Investigate

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What evidence do you have to catch me?

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to die

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I want to destroy you

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Lu Yi, why are you looking for me?

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sir

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You Pei Chengfu Si

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dare to touch our military department

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You just don't

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you doing?

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll give you a chance

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ask me three questions

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Guess why you are here

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I ask

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I ask

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I ask

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is it related to the military department?

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Correct

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Next

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Su Ting

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Lost something again

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Correct

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Next

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What is lost

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What is lost

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I also want to know

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is a dream

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I do not know

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I really do not know

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
An innocent person

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I do not know what the question is

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And you

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Obviously know

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I really do not know

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Still do not know

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Still do not know

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Brother

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I say

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I say

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is Yanhai Department of Defense

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I do not suspect

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Cao Kun stole the Department of Defense

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I do not know

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I do not know

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I do not know

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Cao Kun stole the Department of Defense

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Come

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Your food

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you like fish?

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Eat some

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm so hungry

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Go go go

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How about this fish

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Where did you come from?

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Eat white food in the sky

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Little two

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Drive out

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No mercy

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm leaving

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Wait

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Six bowls of rice in the sky

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Come right away

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What do you want

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You said you ran

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What to hide

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm so proud

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Made me want to run around the gold and gold corners every day

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I can't even eat any food

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are Cao Ling

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Pity

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Such a beautiful beauty

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm tired

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You who

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Six dishes

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yuan Jinxia

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Master Yuan

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Master Yuan, look at us

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We are both Liang Min

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I do not know why you are looking for us

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Draw quite like

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What do you think

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Master, look carefully

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is not like me at all

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Really

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But why do I look so like it?

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is it delicious?

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Master has a lot

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
One

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Two

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Three

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Four

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Five

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Six

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Seven

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Eight

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Nine

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Two

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It hurts

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Three

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It turns out to be a woman

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The next thing I hate most is tying my hair

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Big brother

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You run for him

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He treats you like this

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wait here

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll be back soon

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Go go go

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go go go

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Go go go

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Go go go

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go go go

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Go go go

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Go go go

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Go go go

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Big Yang

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You like to eat fresh food

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I hate you

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I let you run

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I let you run

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I said, Xia

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't just talk to the big sister

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Have to do something serious

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I did a good job

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sir

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
All the information you want to Cao Kun is here

153
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Cao Kun's birth

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All because of the recommendation of Minister of War Xu Lang

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sir

156
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If the defense map is really stolen by Cao Kun

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Do you think this matter will have anything to do with Minister Xu?

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Xu Lang is new to the position

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This defense map is stolen

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's not good for him

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There is another possibility

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This Cao Kun is a spy who lurks around Xu Lang

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Officer

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This gold bar

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ten times more than the reward

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm too expensive, let me go

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Come

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Come

170
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Officer

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is all my family

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can tolerate

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I beg you, sir

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can tolerate, okay?

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Can exchange for eight hundred taels of silver

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, sir, that's good

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
How do you know I'm a shortcoming?

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is it?

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If this matter is spread

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I won't tie this job

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then I can't do it for this gold bar

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Kill you

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Officer

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let me go

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I beg you, I beg you, officer

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let me go, I'm really going to do this

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Officer

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Officer

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Eat and give me a job

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You can't kill me

194
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Officer, let me go first

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, let me go first

196
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Girl

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
For this kind of man

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Come, eat

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And you

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This table is all your money

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If you don't eat now, you won't have so much food in prison

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So much food

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Officer, didn't you collect the gold bar?

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
New job

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Dayang, you take him back

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Be sure to keep an eye on people

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Take care of Cao Ling'er, I'm leaving

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I also collect the gold bar

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Again

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Sir, received the report

212
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Master

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Master

214
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What new case

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This is the house of Cao Kun

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Today at this time, the fire was big

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Burned a master

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And Cao Langzong

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Just in time in the house

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
When the servants found out

221
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The house was burned

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The house was burned

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The house was burned

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The house was burned

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The house was burned

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When the servants found out

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The man was dead

228
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Where is the body? In the house

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Just let me see

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Your recent homework

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How did you learn

232
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
go

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think this is Mrs. Cao

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Master

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Master

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you sure this is

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Mr. Cao's body?

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Master

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Last night, I was working

241
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I also sent a bowl of sweet soup

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
to send Kun to untie

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
After that, I regained consciousness

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I didn't expect to wake up

245
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Gu Yu Bao

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He was dead

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Gu Yu Bao

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Master

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
How is it

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mr. Cao was killed

251
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Look

252
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He was burned

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
His body is black

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But there is no blackness in his mouth and arms

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
In common sense

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Even if the fire is not on

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Will struggle

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But this body

259
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He was raised by water

260
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So before the fire

261
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He was dead

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You said you brought sweet soup last night

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
To see Mr. Cao

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Do you think

266
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I killed Master

267
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I didn't say anything

268
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Why are you so nervous

269
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Master is so kind to me

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I have no reason

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I want to kill him

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't be nervous

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You will know if you are poisoned

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No poison

275
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Okay

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Did you have any wounds before

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Ten years ago

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I have a scar on my chest

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Thank you

teacher

293

If what Mrs. Cao said,

294
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,200
this corpse

295
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,920
is indeed the one that Mr. Cao is right.

296
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,240
Master.

297
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm telling you,

298
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
the legal department has already written a document.

299
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,360
Whoever takes this case

300
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,040
and catches the murderer

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,920
will be rewarded with 15 taels of silver.

302
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,800
How much?

303
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
15 taels?

304
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,560
In addition,

305
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,280
all the compensation will be paid.

306
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,200
Master.

307
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,760
This is good.

308
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
Give me this case.

309
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,120
My third brother

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,560
will have to read the private register next year.

311
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,160
You, you, you, don't get involved.

312
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,960
Read the private register.

313
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,640
Look at me.

314
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm so thin.

315
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,120
I haven't eaten meat for three months.

316
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,560
Look.

317
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,160
My eyes are swollen.

318
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,800
Look.

319
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,480
They are swollen.

320
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm going to pay for this silver.

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,800
Next, Miss.

322
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,440
Look at my clothes.

323
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
I can't make up for it.

324
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,840
If I make up for it, it will be a disaster.

325
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,440
Can you give this case to me?

326
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,360
Okay.

327
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,400
Give me the case.

328
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,840
I don't want to eat your case.

329
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
You are all men.

330
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,280
Why do you want to fight with me?

331
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,000
Master.

332
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,400
I have to earn this silver.

333
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,080
If I don't get the silver back,

334
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
my mother will sell me.

335
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,480
And she always thinks that

336
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,800
we six are not rich enough.

337
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,000
She doesn't let me be the compensator.

338
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
You have to save me.

339
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,800
Master.

340
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
You have to save us.

341
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,160
You have to save us.

342
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,800
You have to save us.

343
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Master.

344
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Okay, okay, okay.

345
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,000
Stop arguing.

346
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,840
The document is here.

347
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,200
Whoever gets it,

348
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,600
this case will be yours.

349
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,520
This is fair.

350
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,280
This is fair.

351
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,840
You.

352
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,560
You.

353
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,160
You.

354
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,880
You.

355
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,400
It's always like this.

356
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
It's me.

357
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,000
It's me.

358
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,640
Really?

359
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,320
The guards.

360
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,440
direito e

361
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
The guards?

362
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,120
Fire your surfaces on.

363
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,680
Everyone champions different sides with Beicon responsibly

364
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,080
Xia'er, you can't be reckless.

365
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,080
I'm the chief minister of the six Sha Sect, Yang Cheng Wan.

366
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,680
I'm incompetent and I'm not qualified.

367
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Please don't blame me, my disciple.

368
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,680
Xia'er, why are you still standing there?

369
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Hurry and apologize to Lord Lu.

370
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,080
Lord Lu?

371
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,080
This is the son of the commander of the Imperial Guards, Lord Lu Yi.

372
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
Lu Jin Li.

373
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,280
So it's Lord Lu.

374
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,280
I didn't know you were the one who offended me.

375
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm a woman, I should be able to be a woman.

376
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,080
You won't be mad at me, right?

377
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Can you give me back my hand?

378
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
In above the inquisiton of the record of SWOT,

379
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,480
my duty here in General Bash nuance has been acceptable.

380
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,720
If one of you can't make it,

381
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,680
she might be able to forget that her rise to power

382
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,480
was caused by precise use.

383
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,000
That must have slightly affected her highly

384
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,080
and caused such a huge loss of influence.

385
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,880
As such, it would interfere withbery portion between us.

386
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,760
But I hate it if we use thisized power.

387
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,480
I didn't mean

388
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
this matter concerning the program of intelligence.

389
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm simply Leaving for now

390
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,280
is very flippant.

391
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
But...

392
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I still have a question.

393
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Official Lu, this...

394
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
It's just a matter of time.

395
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,780
You don't need to panic.

396
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,780
Yes.

397
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780
My question is...

398
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780
The hand gun of the Sacred Skill Battalion

399
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,780
was left at the 12th year of Yongle.

400
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780
The shortest one is almost 10 inches.

401
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,780
This hand gun is less than 7 inches.

402
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,780
What's going on?

403
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Answer my question.

404
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Official Lu,

405
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,780
Official Lu, I designed it myself.

406
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,780
I asked someone to make it.

407
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
Designed by yourself?

408
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
No wonder it's so powerful.

409
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
Where's Cao Kun's body?

410
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,780
Inside the room.

411
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
Come here.

412
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Insolent.

413
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Let's go.

414
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
Are you sure that this body belongs to Cao Kun?

415
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,780
I've just checked the body.

416
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,780
I found the mark left by Cao Kun.

417
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
Mrs. Cao has confirmed it.

418
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,780
Sen Fu,

419
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,780
send someone to bring this body back to the North Town Office.

420
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,780
We'll check it again.

421
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,780
Yes.

422
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,780
Are you suspecting me?

423
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
Then tell me,

424
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
where's the mark left by the body?

425
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,780
According to Mrs. Cao,

426
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
10 years ago, Cao Kun's chest was injured by a sword.

427
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,780
And left a piece of the sword head.

428
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
This is the piece found in his chest.

429
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
I found it true.

430
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,780
This is the body.

431
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
Could the body belong to Cao Kun?

432
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Or the subject to whom he played a role?

433
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,780
After these two years,

434
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,780
they took out cast iron.

435
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
So,

436
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,960
the truth is not necessarily the real result.

437
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Sen Feng, check if there are any missing persons in Cao's manor.

438
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,760
Yes.

439
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,960
If the deceased is not Cao Kun, then where is the real Cao Kun?

440
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,160
Xia'er.

441
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,960
Cao Kun even involved in a case of colluding with the enemy to rebel.

442
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,960
This case is the result of the Beizhen Manor.

443
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Sir Lu, the Three Judicial Offices have already filed a case of colluding with the enemy.

444
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I fear that it is inappropriate for you to be so lazy.

445
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Vice Minister Yang, the Six Cages' family is well-off and the manpower is limited.

446
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,160
They even won't let go of the weak women.

447
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,560
If we insist on filing such a case, I fear that it is inappropriate.

448
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,960
It stinks!

449
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,160
Brother, I saw you looking like a dog.

450
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,560
Why do you have such a bad breath?

451
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,160
Xia'er, you...

452
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,560
Sen Feng.

453
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,560
I will temporarily take this Three Judicial Offices' document.

454
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,760
I will naturally explain this matter to His Majesty.

455
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,160
Since it is so, then I will do as you say.

456
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,960
I will take my leave then.

457
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,560
Sir Lu.

458
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,960
Wait!

459
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,560
Sir, you can leave.

460
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,160
You can return my bandage and handgun to me.

461
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,360
You just used the handgun to hit me.

462
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
I still haven't forgotten about this matter.

463
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,760
But you also scared me earlier.

464
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,560
We also got into a fight.

465
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,360
But that doesn't mean that I will forgive you.

466
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,360
You...

467
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,760
The Imperial Guards are the most trusted warriors of His Majesty.

468
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,760
His Majesty loves the people so much, yet you are so ungrateful.

469
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,360
Xia'er.

470
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,160
You moved Cao Kun's body away.

471
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,560
You also want to take away the document that I stole.

472
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,360
Fine. I will just treat it as you both want to go to the palace.

473
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,360
But you can't take my private property with you.

474
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,360
If you are capable of solving the case, I will return the handgun to you.

475
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,360
So you look down on me.

476
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Fine. I will catch the murderer before you do.

477
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,960
I will let you Imperial Guards be humiliated.

478
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,360
Xia'er, you are being too much.

479
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,560
Teacher, it's because the Imperial Guards are too kind.

480
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,960
Tofu! Tofu!

481
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,360
Wake up!

482
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,160
Tofu!

483
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,960
Mother!

484
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
You are back.

485
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,760
Little wild boar! Little wild boar!

486
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,960
What are you doing?

487
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,760
Your Highness Yuan is the little wild boar that you picked up.

488
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,560
If you have the guts, say it again.

489
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,360
It's no use calling me mother. I'm telling you.

490
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,560
What are you doing?

491
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,960
Mother is bullying me. She is bullying me.

492
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,160
Let me see.

493
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
You are so petty. You are trying to save the bad guys and get into a fight.

494
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,360
It's your child that hit me and you still call me a wild boar.

495
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
The child is young and doesn't know how to behave. How can you, an adult, be arguing with a child?

496
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
You are the aunt that Madam Yuan brought back.

497
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,560
You don't even know who gave birth to you.

498
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,160
Calling you a wild boar, is that wrong?

499
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,360
The child doesn't know how to behave. Of course, he doesn't know how to behave.

500
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,960
The neighbors in the street are living here. How are you going to buy our Tofu?

501
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,360
Hurry and go home!

502
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,960
Let's go.

503
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Mother, you are amazing. You just scared them away with a few words.

504
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,360
Don't mind them. You...you...you...

505
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
It's your birth.

506
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,560
Let's go. Let's go home.

507
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,760
You finished eating and went to wash and change your clothes.

508
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,360
I can smell the sweat and smell of your sweat.

509
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,160
Mother.

510
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,760
I already told you that what kind of mischief a woman like you is doing.

511
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,360
You are so tired and tired. You don't even look like one.

512
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,560
If you had listened to me and married the east-of-the-city man,

513
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760
that Sun family who makes cakes, then...

514
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,760
I am not marrying that beastly man. My body is not as strong as I am.

515
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,960
The Sun family makes peach blossom pancakes.

516
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,760
Their business is booming.

517
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,960
They even bought a shop in Xinfeng Bridge.

518
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,360
If you had listened to me and married the man,

519
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,560
you would be a young lady now.

520
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,360
It's no use saying anything now.

521
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,760
Do you know that the Sun family's daughter-in-law is already pregnant?

522
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,560
Look at you.

523
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,360
Mother, your daughter is not that bad.

524
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,160
And I am not in a rush to marry her yet.

525
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,760
Why are you still not marrying her?

526
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,560
Continue being a stockholder.

527
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,560
Take this month's salary.

528
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,160
I will save it for you as dowry.

529
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,560
No.

530
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,960
Are you saving money secretly?

531
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Don't think that I don't know.

532
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,360
You are working hard and tired to be a stockholder.

533
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,760
You save money to save money to save money for your parents.

534
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,560
How many years has it been?

535
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,760
You still can't wake up from this dream?

536
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,760
Look at me.

537
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,760
Look at me.

538
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,160
I am your biological mother.

539
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,760
I am a dog that wants to pull you into a pond.

540
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
A heartless one.

541
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,960
I think about those people who abandoned you.

542
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,360
Heartless.

543
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,560
Mother, eat.

544
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,760
After you finish cooking, go and sell my roasted bean curd.

545
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,360
Okay.

546
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,160
Sir.

547
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
What is it?

548
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,960
We have thoroughly examined that body.

549
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,760
It was found after death.

550
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,360
Also, Cao Kun's only daughter, Cao Ling'er,

551
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,160
has eloped with a guest named Li Dan.

552
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,560
Mrs. Cao has reported to the Six Caves Sect

553
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,960
and has now sent Li Dan to the police.

554
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,760
I never thought that this woman would know these kinds of knowledge.

555
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,960
It's just a pity that she is short in stature and not far in the city.

556
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Li Dan is a key person.

557
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,160
Let's go.

558
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,160
Everyone, look.

559
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,560
The rich people are in the front. The poor people are in the back.

560
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Come, look.

561
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
Okay, thank you.

562
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,760
Come again.

563
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,560
Okay.

564
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,760
Okay. You go there. Let's go.

565
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,560
It's real tofu.

566
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,760
Okay.

567
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,960
Thank you, everyone.

568
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,360
The rich people are in the front.

569
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,160
Two pieces of dried tofu, no spicy oil.

570
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,960
Tofu chicken wings.

571
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,560
Hey, how did you know I was here?

572
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,760
I went to your house and sent two fish.

573
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,960
Your mother said that you were looking after the stall.

574
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,160
Did you see the one with the broken chest?

575
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,360
I was looking after three pieces of dried tofu.

576
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
He hit me eight times.

577
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
He has been torturing me all night.

578
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,560
He has saved our salary for a month.

579
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,760
Why should we still be the payment?

580
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,360
You don't feel hurt?

581
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
You feel the money first?

582
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,960
I...

583
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,560
You...

584
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,160
To be honest, I came to tell you that Li Dan ran away.

585
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,960
Ran away?

586
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,360
How did he run away?

587
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,760
He just knocked on the lock and ran away.

588
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,360
Where are the brothers who opened the door?

589
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
They didn't have enough men. No one to replace them.

590
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
That guy went out to eat.

591
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,760
After a little tea, he ran away.

592
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
Look at that old man.

593
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,560
You...

594
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,560
Who is it?

595
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,760
Hey, you...

596
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,560
Speak.

597
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,360
Li Dan?

598
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,560
Where is he?

599
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,760
Sir, I don't know.

600
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,360
I really don't know.

601
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,560
Please let me go. Sir.

602
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,360
You don't know?

603
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Take him back to the prison.

604
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,760
Yes.

605
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
Sir.

606
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,360
Sir, please let me go.

607
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Sir, I really don't know. Sir.

608
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,960
Please let me go. Sir.

609
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,360
Get up.

610
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,160
I really don't know. Sir.

611
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,760
Sir.

612
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Go.

613
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,560
Sir.

614
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,160
Sir. Sir Lu. Sir Lu.

615
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,960
Jinxia.

616
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,560
That... I...

617
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,360
You... You can't rob my tofu stall.

618
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,560
You can't.

619
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,160
What do you want?

620
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,160
Sir, actually my tofu stall is not expensive.

621
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,560
Just give me two taels of silver.

622
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,960
If you give me the silver, I'll come immediately.

623
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,160
Otherwise, I can't explain to my mother when I go back.

624
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,960
Give her the silver.

625
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,960
Sir, don't forget our bet.

626
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,760
Let's go.

627
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
Let's go.

628
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,760
We finally caught Li Dan.

629
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,760
The police didn't take him away easily.

630
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,160
They said they were capable.

631
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,760
I think they only want to rob us.

632
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,160
They just want to show off.

633
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,160
But we don't have any witness now.

634
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Your bet with Sir Lu must be in a bad situation.

635
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,760
I think you should be ready to admit defeat.

636
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,160
Admit defeat?

637
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,560
Impossible.

638
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I haven't started yet.

639
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,360
This is not my style.

640
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,960
Don't worry. I won't admit defeat.

641
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,560
Good.

642
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,160
When I was still a saint,

643
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,960
I must have played the flute and played the zither for a long time.

644
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,760
Now, I can see Lu Jingli is laughing at me.

645
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,360
It's said that the essence of this play is

646
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,360
that you can't win by your strength.

647
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,560
I think Your Majesty,

648
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,360
you should be more careful.

649
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,560
I'm not a good player.

650
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,760
I think Your Majesty is the most knowledgeable person.

651
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Lu Jingli's words always make me speechless.

652
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I'm not talented. You're overpraising me.

653
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Is there any clue about the loss of documents in the Ministry of War?

654
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
Thank you for your concern.

655
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,560
I've investigated this matter thoroughly.

656
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,760
I can get the result soon.

657
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Good. I believe

658
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,760
you will give me a satisfactory answer.

659
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,560
Yes.

660
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,360
What? Play another round with me?

661
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,160
Okay.

662
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,960
Elder Ge, slow down.

663
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,360
Place the ball here.

664
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,760
Yes.

665
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,360
Your Majesty is playing the zither?

666
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
The winner will be released first.

667
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,960
I think Your Majesty slept well last night.

668
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,560
That's why you're in such a good mood today.

669
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
No.

670
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,760
Your Majesty, you're worried about the Ministry of War.

671
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,760
Elder Ge, are you okay?

672
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,760
Your Majesty.

673
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,360
I bow to Your Majesty.

674
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,160
Please get up.

675
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
Are you hurt?

676
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,960
I'm afraid.

677
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,560
Please don't worry.

678
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,960
I'm sorry.

679
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,760
I scared you.

680
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Please forgive me.

681
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm sorry.

682
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
I'm sorry.

684
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,160
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,760
I'm sorry.

686
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,360
You're the son of Lu Tinglu.

687
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,760
Rumors say that Lu Jingli is not only good at martial arts,

688
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,960
but also good at playing the zither.

689
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,360
You're indeed a good son.

690
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,960
You're really a good son.

691
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,760
You're overpraising me.

692
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,160
I'm not good at martial arts.

693
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,760
I beg Your Majesty to give me some respect.

694
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm a senior official.

695
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Some people are gossiping about me.

696
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,760
Elder Yan, don't take it seriously.

697
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,160
I'm just a little bit angry.

698
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,560
I can't compare to Your Majesty.

699
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Lu Jingli is too much.

700
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,760
If you didn't play the zither well,

701
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm afraid you're not just passing by.

702
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,560
Enough.

703
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,160
Elder Yan,

704
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,560
Lu Jingli is my junior.

705
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,760
You don't have to argue with him.

706
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,360
Besides, you're all my beloved ones.

707
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,960
Don't get angry because of this.

708
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Your Majesty, Yanlu and his family are in the court together.

709
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,560
They've always been good friends.

710
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,560
How can I be angry with you?

711
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,760
You're a generous person.

712
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,160
I admire you.

713
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,960
Sir.

714
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,760
Zhao Yu is here.

715
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,360
No one is here.

716
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,160
When did you come up with a plan to rebel against Zhao Yu?

717
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,560
What's so strange about that?

718
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,360
I've never seen you in my house.

719
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,160
Don't worry.

720
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,960
Okay.

721
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,160
I finally know why you like cooking so much.

722
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,960
It's a legend.

723
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,560
Go.

724
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,360
Go and take a look.

725
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,560
Let's get serious.

726
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,960
Are you sure this Li Dan knows where Cao Kun is?

727
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,360
There must be something wrong with Li Dan.

728
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Or else, the Imperial Guard can't keep an eye on him.

729
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,560
Who is the Imperial Guard?

730
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,960
He eats people without spitting out their bones.

731
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,360
I'm a man of my word.

732
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,160
Keep your voice down. Don't let anyone hear you.

733
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Okay. Let's go in.

734
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,360
Let's go.

735
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,560
Let's go.

736
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,360
Thank you.

737
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,560
Wait.

738
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,960
You two, go over there.

739
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,760
You, go over there.

740
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,160
Okay.

741
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
It's time to eat.

742
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,960
It's time to eat.

743
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,560
This way.

744
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,160
Thank you.

745
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,560
Enough. This way.

746
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,960
Why is there this again?

747
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,560
Forget it. I can't eat anymore.

748
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,160
You're not eating? You're giving it to me?

749
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,960
Where is it?

750
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,560
Tell me where Cao Kun is.

751
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,560
You and that Lord Lu are really the same kind of person.

752
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,760
Please ask some weird questions.

753
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,960
I admit that I've wronged Cao Kun's daughter.

754
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,560
But apart from that, I really don't know anything anymore.

755
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,960
Big Sister, can you let me go?

756
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,160
Who is your Big Sister?

757
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,760
But if you tell me, I can be your grandmother.

758
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,960
You want another one, right?

759
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,760
Okay. I'll give you another one.

760
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,160
My gold bar. I clearly...

761
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
How did you get it?

762
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Say it or not, if you don't say it, these are all mine.

763
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,560
My dowry isn't even enough.

764
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,160
Old Madam, I'll say it. I'll say it.

765
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,560
This is how it is.

766
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,360
Greetings, Lord.

767
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,360
From tomorrow on, don't send her any food.

768
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,960
Yes.

769
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
I'll go.

770
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,560
I'll go.

771
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,560
I'll go.

772
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,760
I'll go.

773
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,360
I'll go.

774
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I'll go.

775
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,760
I'll go.

776
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,760
I'll go.

777
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,760
I'll go.

778
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,560
I'll talk to you after I find Cao Kun.

779
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,560
This... this... this...

780
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,560
How's the investigation going?

781
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,960
You never fail to do anything.

782
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,560
Think about it. This Li Dan is a servant.

783
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,360
He sold us three gold bars at once.

784
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,360
I thought he was a thief.

785
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Then I went to the Cao Manor to investigate.

786
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,760
I found out that Cao Kun was in the Cao Manor for half a month.

787
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,360
He had bought gold bars from the account book.

788
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,160
Looking at it this way, the gold bars Li Dan had

789
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,960
must have been given by Cao Kun.

790
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,760
Then where did you find those gold bars?

791
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,960
Speaking of gold bars,

792
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,560
after I left the Cao Manor, I went to Li Dan's house to look around.

793
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,760
I'm also a person who loves money. I have a heart of silver.

794
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,360
I soon found out where he hid his treasure.

795
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,960
That means Cao Kun and Li Dan eloped.

796
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Did you arrange it beforehand?

797
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,560
Da Yang, I thought you only know how to cook.

798
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,960
You thought it through.

799
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,760
Cao Kun arranged Li Dan to take Cao Kun with him.

800
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I didn't expect Li Dan to take money from someone

801
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,960
and really seduce that girl.

802
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,560
That's not right. Since all of this was arranged by Cao Kun,

803
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,560
why did he still report to the authorities and ask them to arrest Li Dan?

804
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,960
It wasn't Cao Kun who reported to the authorities.

805
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,160
It was a lady he married.

806
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,960
After we got married, I had no reason to hurt him.

807
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,360
He's so cunning.

808
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,360
The next one is smart.

809
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Oh, right. Li Dan told me two possible places Cao Kun hid.

810
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
One in the city and one outside.

811
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,160
Based on Cao Kun's daughter's personality, I think he still hasn't left the capital.

812
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,760
We'll split up and look for him. We must catch him before the police.

813
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,560
If there's no one in the city, come meet me outside the city.

814
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Okay.

815
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,160
Let's go.

816
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,960
The rain falls, I'm lost.

817
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,960
My thoughts are tangled.

818
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,360
The wind howls, I'm shocked.

819
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,560
My heart is blank.

820
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,760
Thousands of miles of ambush are coming.

821
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,160
Who is outside the city?

822
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,160
I can't beat the fate of love.

823
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,160
Close your eyes, I can see your face.

824
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,360
Open your eyes, the back is cold.

825
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,160
The knife is sharp.

826
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,160
Who is fighting against the wind in the city?

827
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,160
No sound, the sword is sharp.

828
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,160
No sound, the sword is sharp.

829
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:20,160
The fate is turning, I see the changes in the world.

830
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,160
It's like saying goodbye, goodbye is too sad.

831
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:33,560
I miss the golden days.

832
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:39,360
The day I met you.

833
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,960
The white hair on the skyline.

834
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,760
We spent our years together.

835
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,160
In the twinkling of an eye, a thousand years.

836
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,160
The love of the past.

837
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,160
The love of the past.

838
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,160
The love of the past.

839
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,160
The love of the past.
