00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The song is over

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hear

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your heartbeat is still in my ears

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just a moment

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Separate two sides

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Never to be found again

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will disappear

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your tears are falling in my heart

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid a blink of an eye

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Will disappear

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,980
Temporary

Episode 16

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
I'll tell you a secret.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,840
I...

20
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
I kissed you.

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Kissed me?

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,720
When?

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Feng Liao.

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,200
I gave you medicine at that time.

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
What happened?

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,600
What happened to your mouth?

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,200
Well...

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,840
When I went to the river to get water yesterday,

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
I accidentally hit a big rock.

30
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,720
So I choked.

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,320
Look.

32
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,640
You forgot it.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,360
But you don't have to remember.

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,080
I had no choice.

35
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,080
So,

36
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
how do you feel?

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Feel?

38
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,080
How can I feel?

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,320
I was so confused.

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,760
Now I almost forget it.

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,920
Forget it?

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,680
I forgot it too.

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,360
I'd better try again.

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
Maybe I can remember it.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,160
Try again?

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,000
No, no, no.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,280
I can't take advantage of you.

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,280
It's okay.

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,760
Thank you.

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,880
I said it once.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,400
You forgot it.

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,760
I'm an adult.

53
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,680
You have to listen to me.

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Yes.

55
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
You're an adult. I'll listen to you.

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,120
Better?

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,240
Yes.

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I heard your heartbeat echoing in my ears.

59
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,240
In just a moment, we separated twice.

60
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Perhaps we will never meet again.

61
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I heard your heartbeat echoing in my ears.

62
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,240
In just a moment, we separated twice.

63
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Perhaps we will never meet again.

64
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:05,240
In just a moment, we separated twice.

65
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Perhaps we will never meet again.

66
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I saw your tears falling from your heart.

67
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I saw your tears falling from your heart.

68
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:03,240
I saw your tears falling from your heart.

69
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:13,240
I saw your tears falling from your heart.

70
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:23,240
I saw your tears falling from your heart.

71
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:33,240
I saw your tears falling from your heart.

72
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:43,240
I saw your tears falling from your heart.

73
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Wine, wine.

74
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Yan Ge, you're good.

75
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,240
You even hid some private goods.

76
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Put it well.

77
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Oh my god.

78
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:31,240
My head hurts.

79
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,240
This wine is too strong.

80
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I drank last night.

81
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I drank last night.

82
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I drank last night.

83
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
I finally thought of you.

84
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I finally thought of you.

85
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I finally thought of you.

86
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I fell down.

87
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:07,240
I fell down.

88
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,240
I fell down.

89
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
What happened after that?

90
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Why can't I remember anything?

91
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Why is there something like this on my head?

92
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,240
I fell down.

93
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Miss Yuan.

94
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Miss Yuan.

95
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Coming.

96
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Miss Yuan, what's the matter?

97
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Madam asked me to bring you the new clothes.

98
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Tomorrow is the day of the flower exhibition.

99
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,240
You must look good in this.

100
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Thank you for your concern.

101
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
The clouds on the window are so beautiful.

102
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,240
They are as beautiful as you.

103
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I won't disturb you.

104
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Thank you.

105
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Sir.

106
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Come in.

107
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,240
I have something to ask you.

108
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
What is it?

109
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Last night...

110
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Last night...

111
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
What happened last night?

112
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I was drunk last night.

113
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,240
I don't know if I did anything wrong.

114
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,240
No.

115
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
That's good.

116
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Sir, do you know this hairpin...

117
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
This hairpin?

118
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
I saw it in the Cen Mansion.

119
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Me?

120
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
It's yours.

121
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,240
I saw you drunk last night.

122
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
So I asked Cen to send you back.

123
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,240
I think he sent you back at that time.

124
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Why did he send me back?

125
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I think he bought it for me.

126
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,240
I don't know any girl here.

127
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
So he sent it to you.

128
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
But there is a word on it.

129
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
You bought it for me.

130
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
The hairpin?

131
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
What a coincidence.

132
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Really?

133
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Why didn't I notice it?

134
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
It's meant for you.

135
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:15,240
It's meant to be yours.

136
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,240
I thought...

137
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Nothing.

138
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Nothing.

139
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Nothing.

140
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Dad, mom.

141
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Daughter, come here.

142
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Beautiful.

143
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
So beautiful.

144
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Xia.

145
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
You are so beautiful today.

146
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
I can't recognize you.

147
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm called Miss Yuan today.

148
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Miss Yuan.

149
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Miss Yuan.

150
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I don't know you.

151
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I just know you.

152
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I just know you.

153
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
I just know you.

154
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
I just know you.

155
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I just know you.

156
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I told you to wear pink.

157
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Why it's blue?

158
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,240
But it's not for girls.

159
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,240
You are so beautiful.

160
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,240
You look so elegant in blue.

161
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
You look so elegant in blue.

162
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
You look so elegant in blue.

163
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Thank you.

164
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Thank you.

165
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Today, all the beautiful girls in Hangzhou are here.

166
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,240
So beautiful.

167
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,240
You look like a housekeeper.

168
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Maybe my ancestors were officials.

169
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
Yes.

170
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
It's better if you can shut your mouth.

171
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Of course.

172
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
You are so funny.

173
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Miss Yuan.

174
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Qi Yuan.

175
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Sit.

176
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Miss Shangguan.

177
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
You are here.

178
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Lord Sima is here.

179
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Lord Sima.

180
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Lord Sima.

181
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Lord.

182
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
This is Sima Chang'an.

183
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
I told you about him.

184
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I don't know how ugly he is.

185
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
He even wears a mask.

186
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Lord, please.

187
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Mi'er.

188
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Are you ready?

189
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Don't be nervous.

190
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
I have practiced many times.

191
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Don't worry.

192
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Miss.

193
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
He is so beautiful.

194
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
He doesn't know how to avoid danger.

195
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
He is so kind to me.

196
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
He will suffer sooner or later.

197
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Miss Yuan.

198
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Madam.

199
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Shangguan.

200
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
This is a spider.

201
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
You should keep it.

202
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
It's a rare item.

203
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
The Zanghua Conference is held every three years.

204
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
You should try it.

205
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Mom.

206
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
You are so hard.

207
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
They are good at martial arts.

208
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
My daughter is not good at it.

209
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Besides.

210
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
I didn't prepare it.

211
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
It's not good if I lose face.

212
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
You are right.

213
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
I just want to have fun today.

214
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I will go with you.

215
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Go up and play a sword.

216
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I almost fall asleep.

217
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Really.

218
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
The Zanghua Conference is held every three years.

219
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
It's time.

220
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Get ready.

221
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Get ready.

222
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240

장政

294
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:45,800
Sister's

296
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,200
Good job

297
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,960

298
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,640
Yuan José, you're awesome.

299
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,920
Senior Sister, you're awesome.

300
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,200
Sir.

301
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,320
Meir sorers and badasses can't be escaped after 10 years,

302
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,880
so they sent me here to help a young master.

303
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,360
The good nature of thedr Dosan

304
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,080
and the First Master know them very well.

305
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
Since the court had boil

306
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,200
everyone was helping each other

307
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,400
Here business

308
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
couldn't sell out

309
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
I heard he was in Hangzhou

310
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,480
and had meet for him at Wu Anbao

311
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,600
Yes

312
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,480
You are here in Shangguan Xi

313
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,680
You must know

314
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,440
I have nothing to do with

315
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,680
Wu Anbao

316
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,960
You mean

317
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,680
the water debt of Dong family was destroyed.

318
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,000
But

319
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,000
you'd better not touch this Wuan Gang.

320
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,440
Why?

321
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,080
Do you want to protect Wuan Gang?

322
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,400
Shangguan Xi and I used to have a private relationship.

323
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,880
Now we're strangers.

324
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,320
But the most important thing now

325
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,240
is to complete the task you assigned to me,

326
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,400
not to find the trouble of Wuan Gang.

327
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,440
What do you want?

328
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,040
I have nothing to show you.

329
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,520
Where are you thinking of this time?

330
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,560
What?

331
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,320
Go away.

332
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,760
Why do you keep calling me this?

333
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
Take situations back.

334
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,000
Do I really have to go?

335
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,680
In your eyes,

336
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,640
Yuan Jin Xia is a

337
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,480
threat of discussion in the society.

338
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,560
selected by the young masters here.

339
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,240
So,

340
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,960
whose house will it be?

341
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,680
Don't worry.

342
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,200
Don't worry.

343
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
I'll tell you right away.

344
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,080
The winner is

345
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,960
Shangguanxi.

346
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,560
Great, Sister.

347
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,320
Congratulations, Sister.

348
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,000
Everyone,

349
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,080
the competition is over.

350
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,880
The winner is selected.

351
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

352
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,680
it's time to make a wish.

353
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,800
The winner is...

354
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
In the past, I only thought that

355
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,920
I couldn't get a marriage.

356
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,840
As long as I work hard,

357
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,360
whether it's a job that makes me happy

358
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,720
or my future husband,

359
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,160
I can make a wish.

360
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,200
But it seems that I'm not as good as others.

361
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,840
Your Highness,

362
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,920
if you really have a soul,

363
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,680
tell me

364
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,680
how to distinguish it.

365
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,480
Is that person really loyal to me?

366
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,120
It's a coincidence.

367
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,920
Everyone, take out the book box.

368
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,120
See if there's a net.

369
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,440
If there's a net,

370
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,680
it's the seven-star palace

371
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,200
that meets your wishes.

372
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,680
Your wishes will come true.

373
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,880
Can a net make a wish?

374
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,840
It's so brilliant.

375
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,840
I don't know.

376
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,160
Let's see.

377
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
Open it and see.

378
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,920
It's a net.

379
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,280
Hero Liu,

380
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,160
it means that your wish

381
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
will come true soon.

382
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,800
What wish?

383
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,960
Does it have anything to do with me?

384
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,560
Sir,

385
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,680
did you just participate in the voting?

386
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,680
I did.

387
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,000
I wonder which girl you voted for.

388
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,840
Miss Shangguan,

389
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
don't you open it and see?

390
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,240
The sword of Master Shangguan

391
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,120
is really good at dancing.

392
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,280
Hero Yuan,

393
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,040
I think the music you just played

394
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,240
is soft and tender.

395
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
It has a different taste.

396
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,320
In my heart,

397
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,200
you're the best.

398
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,880
Miss Shangguan,

399
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,040
the painter is painting for you

400
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,080
in the Guanjing Building.

401
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,480
Please come to the Guanjing Building

402
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,040
and enjoy it.

403
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,560
Mi, let's go.

404
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,640
Let's go.

405
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,360
Hero Yuan, let's go.

406
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,440
I haven't finished

407
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,680
what I just said.

408
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,480
Only the sound of the zither

409
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,680
is deep in my heart.

410
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,560
Let's go.

411
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
So talented.

412
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,480
The painting is done.

413
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
Light the lantern.

414
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,080
Sister Shangguan, look.

415
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,160
It's so beautiful.

416
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,080
Dayang, come here.

417
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,600
Look.

418
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,720
Does it look like Sister Shangguan?

419
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,000
Yes, there are some legends.

420
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,760
But I think

421
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
I'm more beautiful.

422
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,760
You're more beautiful?

423
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,520
Let's go.

424
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,160
Dayang, don't look at me.

425
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,960
Here is...

426
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,240
What's this?

427
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
It's dangerous!

428
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,480
Back up.

429
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,280
Second Sister Shangguan.

430
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
Come here!

431
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,120
Bye!

432
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,520
Senior Sister, Your Highness!

433
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,720
Don't push!

434
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,920
Don't push!

435
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,720
Don't push!

436
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,320
Don't push!

437
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,120
Min'er!

438
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,520
Madam!

439
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Where is Miss?

440
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,120
Miss... Miss was just sitting here!

441
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,320
I can't see her. She's not an ordinary woman.

442
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,720
Don't move!

443
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,320
Don't move!

444
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Be careful! Don't move!

445
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,920
Don't move!

446
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,520
Don't move!

447
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,320
Be careful!

448
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,520
Dong Qisha?

449
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Why isn't he dead?

450
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,120
Everyone, don't worry.

451
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,320
That smoke will only make people lose their power temporarily.

452
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,920
There won't be any danger of life.

453
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
Who are you? What do you want?

454
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,120
This place is already under our control.

455
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,520
No one can get out.

456
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,320
My brothers are just here to ask for money.

457
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,920
I don't want to make things difficult for everyone.

458
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,320
I'll only let you go when your family sends you money.

459
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,720
You, how dare you!

460
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
This is the nobility of Hangzhou City.

461
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,320
You dare to kidnap people to get their money?

462
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,120
You, don't you want to die?

463
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,720
It's fine. As long as we don't go out.

464
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,120
Don't touch her yet.

465
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Didn't you notice that they disappeared?

466
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,320
Maybe they are trying to find a way.

467
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,920
Whoever says another nonsense,

468
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,120
I'll kill them.

469
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,320
Okay, from now on,

470
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,720
everyone write a letter to report their family background and family name.

471
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,320
I'll let them send you home.

472
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,720
Oh, right. Look at all the valuable items on your body.

473
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,920
Look carefully and leave all the valuable items.

474
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,520
Second Master, no one else was found.

475
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,920
What? How is that possible?

476
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,120
They must still be in this building.

477
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,920
Especially Yuan Jinxiao.

478
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,520
The First Master's name is not her.

479
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,320
You are just a junior. You have to find her.

480
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,920
Yes.

481
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,120
Let's go.

482
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,520
Where is Jinxia?

483
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,320
We haven't found her yet.

484
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,520
But from Cao Kun's hand,

485
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,720
I found a special and mysterious thing on Dong Yiren's body.

486
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,320
He secretly went to investigate the conspiracy behind Cao Kun.

487
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,120
The person who killed Wang Haifeng.

488
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,520
These animals are really bold.

489
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,320
I'll hold her here. You go to inform the government and come to save her.

490
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,320
No, I have to find Jinxia.

491
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,320
Leave this to me. If the government doesn't come, even Jinxia can't be saved.

492
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Okay. If Jinxia has a short story, I won't let you off.

493
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,920
Sir.

494
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,120
Take her away.

495
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,520
Search the place. We must find Yuan Jinxia.

496
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,120
Yes.

497
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,920
Sir.

498
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,320
Sir, these bandits are all pirates.

499
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,520
I know. They are all under Mao Haifeng's control.

500
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,920
These pirates dare to fight in Hangzhou.

501
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,320
And they are all important people in the city.

502
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Maybe they are not just going to kill Jinxia.

503
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,720
What should we do now?

504
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,920
If we take the secret, we can't protect ourselves.

505
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,520
Don't worry. I'll let Xie Xiaoqu protect us.

506
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
But this place is so remote.

507
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,720
When the soldiers arrive, I'm afraid the pirates have already got what they want.

508
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,520
Don't think too much. Wait.

509
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Take out the money. Hurry.

510
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Hurry.

511
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Hurry.

512
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Give me the letter.

513
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Don't be a coward. Hurry.

514
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Sir.

515
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Okay.

516
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Send it to me.

517
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Give me the money and let me go.

518
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
No.

519
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
Yes.

520
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,720
We haven't found Yuan Jinxia.

521
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Not yet.

522
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,520
Such a bastard.

523
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,920
He will disappear.

524
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,320
Go and find him. Go and find him carefully.

525
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Yes.

526
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,720
Be careful.

527
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Your Majesty, Yan Ge is here.

528
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,120
Come here.

529
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,320
Greetings.

530
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,320
No need to be so polite.

531
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

532
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,920
Your Majesty is in a good mood today.

533
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,320
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

534
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,120
Really?

535
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,720
Thanks to the liao wine that Liao Aiqing presented last night.

536
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,720
I really had a good night's sleep.

537
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Good thing. Good thing.

538
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,920
Liao Aiqing said that

539
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,120
there are many treasures in Aiqing's home.

540
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,720
He must drink liao wine every day.

541
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,520
There is such a beautiful night in his home.

542
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Why haven't I heard you say it?

543
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,520
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

544
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
I didn't want to

545
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,720
give liao wine to you.

546
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,520
You are so eager to ask for the medicine.

547
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,120
I'm afraid that the liao wine

548
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,520
will be too much for you.

549
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,720
So I didn't dare to present it to you.

550
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,120
If you think liao wine is good,

551
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,920
I will go back to my home immediately

552
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,120
and give you all the liao wine.

553
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,920
I have a good intention.

554
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,520
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,920
Go!

556
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,320
Hurry!

557
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,120
Go! Be careful!

558
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,520
Go!

559
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,920
My Lady!

560
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,720
What's wrong?

561
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,520
I was alone

562
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
and hid in the small room all night.

563
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,120
I was so happy.

564
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,920
You... What nonsense are you talking about?

565
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,120
Keep an eye on them.

566
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,520
Don't let any of them go.

567
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,120
Yes.

568
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,120
I have recovered a bit.

569
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,320
I will go and stop Dong Qisheng first.

570
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
No.

571
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,920
No. It's too dangerous.

572
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,320
I should go.

573
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,720
Your martial arts are not as good as mine.

574
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,520
Now you are infected with the red smoke.

575
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,320
You will recover slowly.

576
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,720
I should go to protect you.

577
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,320
But...

578
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,120
Okay.

579
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,320
Here.

580
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,520
Be careful.

581
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,520
My stomach hurts.

582
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,120
No. I have to go and make it convenient.

583
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,920
My stomach hurts.

584
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,120
Stop him! Stop!

585
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Where are you going?

586
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,520
I...

587
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,120
I can't.

588
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,720
I can't.

589
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,120
Don't move!

590
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Or I will kill him!

591
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,520
Master Shangguan.

592
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,720
We meet again.

593
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,120
It seems that we are not meant to be together.

594
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Stop talking nonsense.

595
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,720
Let him go.

596
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
I don't care about that.

597
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,120
I am just following the order.

598
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,520
Even if you kill me,

599
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,720
these brothers won't listen to you.

600
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,120
You...

601
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
The official is here!

602
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Chief He, the official is here!

603
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
The official is here!

604
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,320
Hurry!

605
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Mother, get up!

606
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,920
Hurry!

607
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,520
Mother!

608
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,720
Stop!

609
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Stop!

610
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Stay there!

611
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Hurry!

612
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Go!

613
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,720
Stop!

614
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,520
We run!

615
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
Da Yang!

616
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,520
Don't run!

617
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Come out!

618
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,920
Don't run!

619
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,120
Stop!

620
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
Don't run!

621
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,320
Stop!

622
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,520
Come here!

623
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,320
Go!

624
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Come here!

625
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Go!

626
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Hurry!

627
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Hurry!

628
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Don't worry.

629
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,720
They can't run far.

630
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,320
The official has already gone after them.

631
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Jin Xia!

632
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,320
Jin Xia!

633
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I am relieved to see you are fine.

634
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,320
Where is my senior sister?

635
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,120
I saw Dong Qu Sheng

636
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,720
coming out to arrest sister Shangguan.

637
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,320
But now she is gone.

638
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,520
Dong Qu Sheng?

639
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,920
Isn't she dead?

640
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
No.

641
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Today, Dong Qu Sheng kidnapped us.

642
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,320
Da Yang has gone after them.

643
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,520
But he is trapped.

644
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,120
I'm afraid he can't defeat Dong Qu Sheng.

645
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
I'll go find them.

646
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Jin Xia.

647
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
Let's go.

648
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,720
Master, Lord Liao is here.

649
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
He wants to see you.

650
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
No.

651
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Father!

652
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Father.

653
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,520
I know my mistake.

654
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
You have a lot of people.

655
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,320
Please forgive me this time.

656
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,120
I don't deserve it.

657
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,120
Lord Liao is

658
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,520
the most famous person in front of His Majesty.

659
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Father.

660
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
I heard that

661
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,520
His Majesty has been unwell recently.

662
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,120
I'm worried about His Majesty's health.

663
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,720
So I gave him

664
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,120
the new lily wine.

665
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
But I'm worried that

666
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,520
His Majesty doesn't believe

667
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
the beauty of lily wine.

668
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
You are the most trusted person of His Majesty.

669
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
So I said that

670
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,520
you often drink lily wine.

671
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,120
I have no doubt about you.

672
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,520
You know it.

673
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,120
You have no doubt about me.

674
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
You know what to say

675
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,920
and what not to say.

676
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,120
Don't you know?

677
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
I've been an official for decades.

678
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,320
You can't fool me.

679
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,720
We are close.

680
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,520
Don't come here again.

681
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
See me out.

682
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,520
Father.

683
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,320
Father.

684
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,320
Please.

685
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Father.

686
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,320
Jinxia.

687
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,720
How is it?

688
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,520
I didn't find him.

689
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,920
Sir.

690
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,320
Is there any news from the government?

691
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Not yet.

692
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,520
I have a bad feeling.

693
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,120
No.

694
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
I have to find Dayang.

695
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,520
Where?

696
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Dong Qisheng and Shangguan

697
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
can't run far.

698
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,520
I can't find them

699
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
if I turn around.

700
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
If Dong Qisheng is in trouble,

701
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,920
he will run away alone.

702
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
What do you mean?

703
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,520
Shangguan and Yang Yue

704
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,920
are in a lot of trouble.

705
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,520
I'm afraid they can't run fast.

706
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,520
But Dong Qisheng is fine.

707
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,120
If he can't catch up with the soldiers,

708
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,920
Dong Qisheng will give up

709
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
the two of them

710
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,520
to protect himself.

711
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,520
You mean he has killed

712
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Yang Yue?

713
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,720
I mean if.

714
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,320
Lu.

715
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
I knew you couldn't

716
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
hold Xiangya in your mouth.

717
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,120
You can't see a good person.

718
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
What do you want?

719
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,120
Don't be angry.

720
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,920
I know you are right.

721
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,120
But I'm a little tired.

722
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,920
I haven't slept for a day.

723
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,120
Go back and have a good rest.

724
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,120
I promise you.

725
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,320
I will find them.

726
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,720
Thank you.

727
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,920
Yang Yue.

728
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Are you okay?

729
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,320
I'm fine.

730
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:11,920
Take them in.

731
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,720
Take them all in.

732
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
You thief.

733
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,720
I'm hal conducting your son's memorial.

734
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,420
Is my son here?

735
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,320
Yes, he is.

736
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,820
Give me a moment.

737
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
I have something important.

738
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,720
Don't touch me, give me a time,

739
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
I want to be a hero in front of me.

740
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,120
If I win,

741
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,120
I'll let you pay the price.

742
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Take him in.

743
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Go.

744
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Young Master.

745
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
Lin Ling's death

746
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Lin Ling hasn't been found yet.

747
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Yangzhou is a big place.

748
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Is it so hard to find someone?

749
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
I'm sorry.

750
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
You know that

751
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,120
the old man outside Yangzhou is good at tracking.

752
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,120
He always gives us a half.

753
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
When we find him soon,

754
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
they have left.

755
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
I will continue to find him.

756
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
I...

757
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Young Master.

758
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
I have one more thing to say.

759
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
Say it.

760
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
I just got a message from Hangzhou City.

761
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
They said it was done.

762
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,120
It's the last step.

763
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
Finally, we have a good thing.

764
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,120
The rain falls in a daze.

765
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,120
My mind is in a mess.

766
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,120
The wind blows, the ship is shaking.

767
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,120
My heart is in a whirlpool.

768
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,120
Thousands of miles of ambush come and go.

769
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Who is out of the city?

770
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,120
The fate is hard to compare with.

771
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,120
I can see your face when I close my eyes.

772
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,120
When I open my eyes, I can see the cold in the back.

773
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,120
The sword is full of sweet.

774
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Who has conquered the world?

775
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:24,120
The sound of the flute is heard.

776
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,120
The fate is hard to compare with.

777
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,120
I can see the change in the world.

778
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,120
It's like a farewell.

779
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,120
It's too sad to say goodbye.

780
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,120
The golden leaf of the willow tree

781
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:53,120
meets the white hair of your shoes.

782
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,120
We spend our years together.

783
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,120
In the dream, we are so young.

784
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,120
The End
