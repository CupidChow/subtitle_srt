I'll wait for you at the station.

Okay.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wait for me.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who's wish is to be disturbed by dreams?

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
At this moment, eternity is cut off.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I hear your heartbeat around my ears.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
At this moment, eternity is cut off.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't find eternity.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
General Qi, what's going on?

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is a trap.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I heard that when Mao Haifeng was trapped in Cen Gang,

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
less than a thousand people were there.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But our army mobilized almost a thousand people.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We couldn't attack them.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is there anything special about Cen Gang?

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Indeed, there are many caves around Cen Gang.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There are many caves around Cen Gang.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The terrain is dangerous.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's hard to attack.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So there's no other way to break through?

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Before we left, General Wu told me

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that the pirates blocked all the ways to the Cen Gang.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's hard to go even if only one way is left.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
General Wu knows that it's easy to break through

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
a terrain that's so easy to break through.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why did he take the risk to attack?

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
At first, General Wu thought that

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
it's easy to defeat Mao Haifeng.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But who knew that Mao Haifeng

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
would retreat our army's attack again and again

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
in the road and sea battles?

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Miss Min.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
Why are you living here in the worst of conditions?

92
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,940
Are you working in the garden,

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,020
but everyone is listening to you?

94
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,600
What's the point of telling me

95
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,120
that you are living here these days?

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,200
You pity me now,

97
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,280
and think I'm pathetic.

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
Not at all.

99
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,820
I'm just banking on our love in this life.

100
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,240
Besides,

101
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,920
I also recently lived with Chengyun House,

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,700
which earned me care.

103
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
Xi Lian, what happened to Li Baosheng's body?

104
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,420
Some people, if you don't go back

105
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,340
they might not even be able to see you again for the rest of their lives.

106
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,700
General Qi, General Yu has arranged a camp for you and the soldiers.

107
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,700
He asked you to rest here. Please come with me.

108
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Okay.

109
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Who are you two?

110
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
This is a military camp. No one is allowed to enter.

111
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Leave now.

112
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Imperial Guard's ambassador, Lu Yi,

113
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
has something important to discuss with General Yu.

114
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Please come with me.

115
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Yes.

116
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Imperial Guard?

117
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,700
It was Lord Wu who ordered me to bring them here.

118
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
You are not allowed to be rude.

119
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
Yes.

120
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Then, please come with me.

121
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
What kind of attitude is that of a soldier?

122
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,700
I already told you that

123
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
the military camp is different from the official camp in the court.

124
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Just get used to it.

125
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Hold on.

126
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Slowly.

127
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Slowly.

128
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Wipe it for him.

129
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Okay.

130
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
General,

131
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,700
there is a person who claims to be a imperial guard.

132
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Lord Lu Yi,

133
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
follow him to the camp.

134
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Yes.

135
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
General,

136
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,700
there is a person who claims to be a imperial guard.

137
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Lord Lu Yi,

138
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Lord Lu Yi,

139
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
General Qi came with us.

140
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,700
He wants to see you.

141
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I haven't been to the capital for a long time,

142
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
but I forgot about this mess.

143
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Sir,

144
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
why is Yu Dayong so arrogant?

145
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,700
We have been waiting for him for almost an hour.

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
General is busy with military affairs.

147
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,700
We should wait for him.

148
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
General.

149
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
You are Lu Yi,

150
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
the son of

151
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,700
the commander of the Imperial Guards, Lu Ting?

152
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Yes.

153
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I came to Yanhai this time

154
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,700
to discuss something with you.

155
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,700
There is nothing between me and the Imperial Guards.

156
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
I am just a general.

157
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
I am just a general.

158
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
There is nothing to discuss.

159
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
General,

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
don't worry.

161
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
Go.

162
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Let's try it out in front of the road.

163
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
You haven't eaten, right?

164
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Yes.

165
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Take Lu Qian to eat.

166
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
After eating,

167
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
set it up.

168
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
When I finish my military affairs,

169
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
I will give you a good day.

170
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
We just finished a big battle.

171
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,700
I think General Yu is very tired.

172
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Please understand.

173
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
You talk too much.

174
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Then,

175
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
you two go with me to eat.

176
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Since General Yu is busy with military affairs,

177
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
I will go first.

178
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Please.

179
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
I want to ask you something.

180
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Is Cengang in this direction?

181
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Cengang?

182
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Yes, yes.

183
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Go from here.

184
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
We will be there soon.

185
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Thank you.

186
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Don't go.

187
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Cengang is fighting recently.

188
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
It's a mess.

189
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
It's not safe for you to go alone.

190
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
It's okay.

191
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Let me ask you again.

192
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Have you seen a group of monks on the way?

193
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,700
A group of monks?

194
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Yes, yes.

195
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
This morning,

196
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
we saw a group of monks.

197
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
They were holding weapons.

198
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
They went to Cengang.

199
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Is there a girl in it?

200
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Girl?

201
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I think there is a girl.

202
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
There is.

203
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I think there is.

204
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Thank you.

205
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
How can we eat these?

206
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I don't eat them.

207
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
But how can you eat such a vulgar food?

208
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
If you can eat it,

209
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
why can't I eat it?

210
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Look.

211
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
It's well-cooked.

212
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
It's similar to what soldiers eat.

213
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Eat.

214
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
It's good.

215
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,700
Little brother.

216
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
You are not old.

217
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Why are you so important to General Yu?

218
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Sir.

219
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I am not young anymore.

220
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
How old are you?

221
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Sir.

222
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
I am fourteen.

223
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
You are only fourteen?

224
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
You said you were not young anymore.

225
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Sir.

226
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,700
I am not young anymore.

227
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
General said

228
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
that after two years,

229
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
he would let me sail

230
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
and learn how to use the fire.

231
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,700
What?

232
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,700
You like the fire?

233
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
You can learn from General.

234
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Maybe you will have a chance

235
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
to enter the God's Camp.

236
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
No.

237
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
I will follow General Yu to fight the pirates.

238
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
I will not go anywhere.

239
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
You are still a child.

240
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
General Yu just arrived.

241
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
He hasn't eaten yet.

242
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
You two eat first.

243
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
I will ask the workshop

244
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
to prepare a meal for you.

245
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
General Yu also eats these food?

246
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Yes.

247
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Yu Dayou

248
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
put us aside.

249
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
He is so generous.

250
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Why is he so generous in front of us?

251
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
After all, he has more military power

252
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,700
than me.

253
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
You can't bully him like that.

254
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Look at him.

255
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
He is so generous.

256
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
If he is a man

257
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
who is good at dancing and singing,

258
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
how can he be so generous?

259
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
He has been in charge of so many things

260
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
for so many years.

261
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
He has been raised so many times

262
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
and suffered so much loss.

263
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
He is like this to us.

264
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
I wonder

265
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
if he can't eat in the official field.

266
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
He can still lead troops to fight now.

267
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
I feel strange.

268
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
It's not strange.

269
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,700
After all, he is a talented person.

270
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Stop.

271
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
What happened?

272
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Japanese pirates.

273
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Oh no.

274
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Ling'er doesn't know martial arts.

275
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
Protect Ling'er.

276
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Leave the rest to me.

277
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Okay.

278
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Ling'er, come down.

279
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Come down.

280
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Brothers, sisters,

281
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
hold on tight.

282
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,700
We are almost there.

283
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Okay.

284
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Brother Yang.

285
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Brother Yang.

286
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Brother Yang.

287
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Brother Yang.

288
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
It's okay.

289
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
We won't die.

290
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Sister, listen.

291
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
It seems that there is a sound of fighting.

292
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Master once said

293
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
that we will meet

294
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
the pirates who are flowing on the way to Cen Gang.

295
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Let's go and have a look.

296
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Go.

297
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Go.

298
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Go.

299
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Uncle Yang, are you okay?

300
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
What's going on?

301
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
What are you afraid of?

302
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Don't bother.

303
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
Be careful.

304
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Go.

305
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Father, how are you?

306
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Father, are you okay?

307
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Uncle Yang.

308
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Brother Yang.

309
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
I'm fine.

310
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Yang Yue, take your father to the carriage.

311
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Okay.

312
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Ling'er,

313
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
see how brother Yang is hurt.

314
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Okay.

315
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Come with me.

316
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Come.

317
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Go.

318
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Slowly.

319
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
General.

320
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Please wait.

321
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I'll finish this bowl of rice first.

322
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
General, please.

323
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm not in a hurry.

324
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
We soldiers in the army

326
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
have eaten a lot of food.

327
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
We are not used to smoking in the west.

328
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
It's still warm now.

329
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
It's good.

330
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
If it's cold,

331
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
when the lamb is served,

332
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
it will be white as a flower.

333
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
It will be more delicious than the spicy food.

334
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
When I was outside the border,

335
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
I also tasted this kind of taste.

336
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
I always thought that

337
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,700
you were a young man in the capital.

338
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I didn't expect that you also went outside the border.

339
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I don't know what you said in your letter.

340
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
I came here this time...

341
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
Mr. Lu, you are a noble.

342
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Mr. Wu said in his letter

343
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
that he asked me to cooperate with you

344
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
to check the war situation

345
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
of the coastal border against the Japanese.

346
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
I naturally dare not disobey.

347
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Mr. Lu.

348
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
These are the war situation

349
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
I have faced

350
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
since I came to Mount Zhou.

351
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
You, the Imperial Guards,

352
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
check these things

353
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
to see if they are clear.

354
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
You don't need me to talk about them.

355
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
You have said it.

356
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
If you are interested in the war meeting,

357
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
I will send someone to invite you to participate.

358
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
General Yu.

359
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Mr. Lu.

360
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,700
You, just stay here and check it slowly.

361
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
I still have military affairs to do.

362
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
I won't accompany you.

363
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
General.

364
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Sir.

365
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Look at this person.

366
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Wu Shou Xu's letter

367
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
is probably helping Dao Ma.

368
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,700
General Yu thought I was here to meet the army.

369
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Bear with it.

370
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Bear with it.

371
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Senior sister.

372
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Slow down.

373
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Senior sister.

374
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Fifth brother's arm and leg are injured.

375
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Hurry up and bandage him.

376
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Okay.

377
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Sit down.

378
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
It will be fine.

379
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Let me see.

380
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Doctor Lin.

381
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
How is my father's injury?

382
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Fortunately, he didn't get injured in the internal organs.

383
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to do anything.

384
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Father.

385
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
It's all my fault for being late.

386
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
I don't know about your kung fu.

387
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
You only know it when you are using the kitchen knife.

388
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Think about it.

389
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
If I had the skills of that year,

390
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,700
I would have already avoided this knife.

391
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
The previous Ye Yong has already passed.

392
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
You have to help him.

393
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
You are already injured.

394
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Don't go to the battlefield.

395
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Yes.

396
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
I think Ling'er is right.

397
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Yang Yue.

398
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
How about this?

399
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Take your father back first.

400
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Go back and rest for a few days.

401
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
Okay.

402
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Father.

403
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
I will send you back to find Jin Xia.

404
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Okay.

405
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
Take good care of him.

406
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
He will be fine soon.

407
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Okay. I know.

408
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Thank you.

409
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Thank you, senior sister.

410
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
You are welcome.

411
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Miss Shangguan.

412
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Come with me.

413
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Thank you.

414
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Slow down.

415
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
I have something to tell you.

416
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Just say it.

417
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Don't move your hands and feet.

418
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,700
I regret that day when you just left.

419
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Regret?

420
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
What do you regret?

421
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
I regret...

422
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
This...

423
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
You are really a moron.

424
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
If you have nothing to say, I will leave.

425
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Don't...

426
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Don't...

427
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Don't go.

428
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
I regret that I didn't see you.

429
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
I regret that I rejected your care.

430
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
I regret that I was cold to you.

431
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
I have thought it through.

432
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
I will protect you in the future.

433
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
I will never leave you.

434
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Stay here.

435
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Be careful.

436
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Father, do you feel better?

437
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Much better.

438
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Thank you, doctor Lin.

439
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
You are welcome.

440
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,700
By the way,

441
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
how do you feel about your scar?

442
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
It feels itchy now.

443
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Bear with it. Don't catch it.

444
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
You need to continue to use medicine.

445
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Take it on three times.

446
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
The scar will gradually fade away.

447
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Can it be restored?

448
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Don't worry.

449
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
It will be as good as before.

450
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Father,

451
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
I have a favor to ask.

452
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
What is it?

453
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Shangguan and I have long been in love with each other.

454
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
I hope you can help me.

455
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
After this matter is over,

456
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
I want you to propose to Shangguan's family on my behalf.

457
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
As long as you agree,

458
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
it's a good thing.

459
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
I will do it.

460
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Senior sister,

461
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,700
it's not a bad thing to marry him.

462
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
You can definitely hold him

463
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
with a single gold.

464
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Okay.

465
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Okay.

466
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
It's settled.

467
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Brother Yang, you are really lucky.

468
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Uncle Yang, you are seriously injured.

469
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Hurry back to the city to heal.

470
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Okay.

471
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
By the way,

472
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
don't forget to kill more pirates for me.

473
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Uncle Yang, you underestimate me.

474
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I want to kill all the pirates.

475
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
You are so generous.

476
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Okay, I'll wait.

477
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
We should set off.

478
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Otherwise, we will be delayed by General Yu.

479
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Uncle Yang, take care.

480
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Take care.

481
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Brothers, we are ready to set off.

482
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
Okay.

483
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Those who are seriously injured,

484
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
just stay here.

485
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
Don't rush to go.

486
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Okay.

487
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Brother 13,

488
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
you stay here to take care of them.

489
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Okay.

490
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Everyone, get ready.

491
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Xiang Er,

492
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
is getting more and more helpful.

493
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
She is getting more and more helpful.

494
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,700
She is exactly the same as her father.

495
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Brother Yang,

496
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
we will leave now.

497
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Okay.

498
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
See you.

499
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Let's go.

500
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Let's go.

501
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Uncle Yang,

502
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,700
take care.

503
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Take care.

504
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Be careful.

505
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
Wait for me to marry you.

506
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Don't worry.

507
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Go.

508
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Go.

509
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Sister, congratulations.

510
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Let's go.

511
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,700
Go.

512
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
Go.

513
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Go.

514
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
Go.

515
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Go.

516
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
Go.

517
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Go.

518
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Go.

519
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
Go.

520
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Go.

521
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
Go.

522
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
Go.

523
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Go.

524
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Go.

525
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
Go.

526
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
My lord.

527
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,700
However, the situation at Cengang Coast is indeed worse than I expected.

528
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Look.

529
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,660
General Qi is right about Cengang.

530
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,180
The terrain is complicated.

531
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,980
Mao Hai Feng seems to be in a difficult position.

532
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,820
In fact, the whole situation is very unfavorable to us.

533
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,300
General Yu is a military expert.

534
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,100
He should know that a strong attack only ruins military power.

535
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,980
He can't just take the lead.

536
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,540
Is there really no other way?

537
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,020
We can only choose to attack the sea.

538
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,220
The pirates are good at sea warfare.

539
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,380
General must have considered this point.

540
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,660
So he chose the south route.

541
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:09,100
This battle is very important for Wu Shou Xu and Yu Dayong.

542
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Sir, it's already time.

543
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,300
You should rest first.

544
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,900
You should rest first.

545
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:37,020
I'll look around the

546
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,860
I don't know whether you are doing well over there.

547
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,700
Did you get hurt?

548
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
He is a imperial guard.

549
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
He has always hurt others.

550
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,380
How dare others hurt him?

551
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Be careful.

552
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,460
You are curious about killing this wild cat.

553
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,180
Sir, you don't have to keep me.

554
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,540
I don't deserve it.

555
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,340
It's late.

556
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
Leave tomorrow.

557
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Have a good time.

558
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,300
I think you are not that smart when you are not sick.

559
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Hey, Lu Yi.

560
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
Don't get in the way.

561
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,260
Sir, what are you doing now?

562
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Do you miss me?

563
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,860
I...

564
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Wait for me.

565
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Sir asked me to wait for him when he left.

566
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,380
I haven't replied to him yet.

567
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
Sir, you have been watching for a whole night.

568
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,860
You should rest for a while.

569
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
It's okay.

570
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
You are here all night?

571
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,860
I want to know the situation of Yu and the pirates.

572
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Now the court is in panic.

573
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
The court is in panic.

574
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
The secret agents are not informed.

575
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
I think you are here to investigate this.

576
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,860
I will tell you clearly.

577
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,860
We are here to serve the country.

578
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
We are here to serve the country.

579
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Now is the time to deal with the war.

580
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,860
The appearance of the imperial guards will only disturb the morale of the army.

581
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,860
It seems that you have a deep grudge against us.

582
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Yes.

583
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,860
The imperial guards don't care about us.

584
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,860
But the appearance of the soldiers is different from the appearance of the people.

585
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Don't worry.

586
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
I am not talented.

587
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,860
But I am here to do my best.

588
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
General.

589
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,860
General.

590
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
The imperial edict.

591
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
The imperial edict.

592
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Yu Dayong, take the edict.

593
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,860
The emperor of the city of Fengtian decrees.

594
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,860
The army of Zhejiang, Yu Dayong, is not good at fighting.

595
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
The flag is broken.

596
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
They will go to Cenggang.

597
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
If you don't take the flag,

598
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,860
the army will be disbanded.

599
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,860
I will take the edict.

600
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,860
It seems that the emperor is always not good at fighting.

601
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,860
He is always in a state of trouble.

602
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
Now the general should understand.

603
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
Why doesn't Mr. Wu object to me coming to the military camp?

604
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
He is investigating the situation in Tongwo.

605
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,860
He knew that the situation in the coastal area has been delayed for too long.

606
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,860
There are many people who speak out.

607
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,860
The emperor has already accepted it.

608
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,860
I came here to visit the people who are in danger.

609
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,860
I am here to help the people who are in danger.

610
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,860
I came here to prove that

611
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,860
the coastal area is not good at fighting.

612
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,860
It is because of the situation.

613
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
It is not because of the situation in Tongwo.

614
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,860
I am a general.

615
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,860
If I don't fight,

616
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,860
do you want me to investigate every day like the imperial guards?

617
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
General is for the country and the people.

618
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,860
I admire him a lot.

619
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,860
But I don't know if you have thought about it.

620
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Now the war is tight.

621
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,860
General is not good at making friends.

622
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,860
This is not exactly giving Wu Shouxu

623
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,860
the best choice.

624
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
I don't believe it.

625
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Mr. Lu, don't try to provoke me.

626
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,860
If you don't believe it, then I will stop here.

627
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Besides, I want to go to the military camp.

628
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
I don't know if you can do me a favor.

629
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,860
If you want to go, then of course you can.

630
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
But I have to pay the bill right now.

631
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I will let Xiangzi take you there.

632
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Thank you, General.

633
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,860
Now the mine is destroyed.

634
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
We can't do business anymore.

635
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Mr. Yan, you have to solve that Lu Yi quickly.

636
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
What?

637
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Mr. Yan won't even let a imperial guard...

638
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
This is wine from the Japanese.

639
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Yes.

640
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,860
How is it going with the business plan of the Japanese?

641
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,860
It's not bad.

642
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
But I don't think it's good.

643
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
I think it's not good.

644
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,860
How is the business plan going with the Japanese?

645
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,860
I originally wanted to control the best mine.

646
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Then I can get the inner road and the transportation of the Japanese.

647
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,860
But I didn't expect Yu Dayong to stop me.

648
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
He just won't give up.

649
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,860
Now, only if we can kill Yu Dayong,

650
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
we can really control the mine.

651
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Then we can control the mine like the people of Fulangji.

652
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,860
We can do whatever we want.

653
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,860
Mr. Yan, with your power in the court,

654
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
it's not difficult to kill Yu Dayong.

655
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,860
So, you invited me here...

656
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
to help you kill Yu Dayong.

657
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,860
You want to use my power to defeat Yu Dayong in the court.

658
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
To help you win this battle.

659
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,860
But I don't sell my country.

660
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,860
You are the one who is fighting the battle, not me.

661
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,860
You are the one who is fighting the battle, not me.

662
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
I originally thought that...

663
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,860
your wish is to rule the world.

664
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
How dare you!

665
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Do you want me to rebel?

666
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,860
I didn't mean that.

667
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,860
I don't want to be the first one.

668
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
I will never be the second one.

669
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
After all, as long as I can control the first one,

670
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
the world will still be mine.

671
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
Good.

672
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,860
You are really smart.

673
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Alright.

674
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,860
Since you have told me your difficulties,

675
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
I have also shown my position.

676
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,860
How about this?

677
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
As long as you defeat Yu Dayong,

678
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,860
I will make him unable to rise again in the court.

679
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,860
I will help you to remove the thorns in your eyes and thorns in your flesh.

680
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,860
How about that?

681
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Good.

682
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Then, I will add another person.

683
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
Prince, who is the person that you are talking about?

684
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
Wu Shouxu.

685
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Good.

686
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
Oh, right.

687
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Do you like it?

688
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
It's good that you like it.

689
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,860
I will give it to you.

690
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,860
Zhan Lanyan, you stay here and serve the head of the family.

691
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Prince, I...

692
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Serve him well.

693
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Don't make the head of the family unhappy.

694
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
If he loses this battle,

695
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,860
all the responsibilities will be on you.

696
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
Thank you, Lord Yan.

697
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,860
I don't like people touching my things.

698
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,860
But I like to give them to you.

699
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
I will treat you well.

700
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,860
Prince, you gave Zhan Lanyan to Mao Haifeng on purpose?

701
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,860
Didn't he ask Dong Qisheng to take Lin Ling and give her to Mao Haifeng?

702
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,860
If he fails,

703
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,860
then he should give her to Mao Haifeng himself.

704
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Then, are you going back to the capital?

705
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,860
Yes.

706
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
Sir, your letter.

707
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,860
Thank you.

708
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
There is nothing else in the letter.

709
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,860
Sir, what did you ask me?

710
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,860
Nothing.

711
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Sir, General Yu sent a message to us.

712
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,860
He asked us to check the armory.

713
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,860
The armory is the treasure of General.

714
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
He asked you to check it.

715
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
He really treats you as a superior soldier.

716
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
Sir.

717
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
General Yu,

718
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,860
I'm sorry.

719
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
I'm sorry.

720
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,860
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
I'm sorry.

722
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
I'm sorry.

724
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
General Yu is really strict.

725
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,860
He asks you to wipe every weapon clean.

726
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Of course.

727
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
Not only these weapons,

728
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,860
the fire department is also very strict.

729
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
No one is allowed to get close to them in one battle.

730
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,860
General Yu, how many times have you attacked the sea?

731
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,860
Since the Zhou Mountain, the sea has attacked five or six times.

732
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,860
But the port here is too long.

733
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,860
The ship was attacked on three sides when it entered.

734
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
The ship was hit by the fire cannon several times.

735
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
The fire cannon should be the farthest shot on the ship.

736
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,860
How far is it?

737
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
About ten meters.

738
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Ten meters?

739
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,860
Then you can attack the ship that is hiding in the harbor directly.

740
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
Yes.

741
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
But the fire cannon is limited in the damage.

742
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
It can only burn the ship.

743
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,860
It's not enough to kill the enemy.

744
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
It would be great if it could lure the ship out.

745
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
But they are very cunning.

746
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,860
No matter how they call me outside,

747
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,860
they won't come out of the harbor.

748
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,860
So General Yu can only send Lulu to attack.

749
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,860
General Yu has no other choice.

750
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
The ship has been hit several times.

751
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
The silver is very tight.

752
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,860
The fire cannon can't be used.

753
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Not to mention the ship is being made again.

754
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
The sea is too big.

755
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Lulu can't fight.

756
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,860
The emperor has to resign from his post.

757
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,860
General Yu is forced to do this.

758
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
The burden on him is not a normal one.

759
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
The ship is very tight.

760
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
The fire cannon is not ready.

761
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
The sea is too big.

762
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
I was so kind to you.

763
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,860
Why did you kill me?

764
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,860
I hate you.

765
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,860
Your life is caused by yourself.

766
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,860
It has nothing to do with me.

767
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,860
If you hadn't dressed up as a man and saved me,

768
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,860
I wouldn't have liked you.

769
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
If you and my brother didn't like each other,

770
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
I wouldn't have been jealous of you.

771
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,860
If...

772
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,860
If I hadn't married Sima Chang'er,

773
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,860
I wouldn't be in this situation.

774
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
I would have a different life.

775
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,860
You are so stupid.

776
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
You still don't know

777
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,860
why you have become like this.

778
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,860
Yes.

779
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
I dressed up as a man because I was playful.

780
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
I happened to save you.

781
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,860
But if the person who saved you was someone else,

782
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,860
then you would have been someone else.

783
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,860
Also,

784
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,860
do you really love Mr. Mu?

785
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,860
Or do you hate me

786
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,860
and don't want to see me be happy?

787
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,860
You framed me before.

788
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,860
Now you are here to kill me.

789
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,860
Do you really hate me that much?

790
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,860
It doesn't matter.

791
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,860
I can only let others arrange everything.

792
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,860
Even my life doesn't belong to me.

793
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,860
No.

794
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
This knife was used by a martial artist

795
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,860
to hide a cup of food.

796
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,860
You can't have it.

797
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,860
Who gave it to you?

798
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,860
Speak!

799
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,860
Who gave it to you?

800
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,860
I'm sorry.

801
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,860
I'm sorry.

802
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,860
I'm sorry.

803
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,860
I'm sorry.

804
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,860
I'm sorry.

805
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,860
I'm sorry.

806
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,860
I'm sorry.

807
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,860
I'm sorry.

808
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,860
I'm sorry.

809
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,860
I'm sorry.

810
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,860
I'm sorry.

811
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,860
I'm sorry.

812
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,860
I'm sorry.

813
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,860
I'm sorry.

814
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,860
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,860
I'm sorry.

816
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,860
I'm sorry.

817
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,860
I'm sorry.

818
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,860
I'm sorry.

819
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,860
I'm sorry.

820
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,860
I'm sorry.

821
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
I'm sorry.

822
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,860
I'm sorry.

823
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
I'm sorry.

824
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,860
I'm sorry.

825
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,860
I'm sorry.

826
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,860
I'm sorry.

827
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,860
I'm sorry.

828
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,860
I'm sorry.

829
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,860
I'm sorry.

830
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,860
I'm sorry.

831
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,860

I'm sorry.

836
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,860
I'm sorry.

837
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,860
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

839
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,860
