00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Here, eat more.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you, sir.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Eat this. This is delicious.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is also good.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Eat more.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why are you giving him this?

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He doesn't like vegetarian food.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Eat.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Come.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's enough.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Not enough. How is it enough?

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're just taking care of your health.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's enough. I really have eaten enough.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Eat more. Eat more.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've eaten enough.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Not enough.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Eat more.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come out.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's you.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's you.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've dragged Ling'er into this.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've dragged these people who are not good at fighting.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm here. You guys go first.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Uncle, you take Ling'er first.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We'll take care of her.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No. Your injury hasn't healed yet.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ling'er doesn't know martial arts.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She'll drag us down.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Take her away first.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Jinxia, let's go.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
None of you

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
can get away from here.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Go.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Go.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Go.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
None of you can get away from here.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Catch that woman.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Go.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My clothes are still in the room.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll go with you.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jinxia.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Jinxia, go.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You guys go first.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sir.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Jinxia, let's distract them.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Go.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sir.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Go.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Go.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Go after them.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Go.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Miss Shangguan.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Miss Shangguan.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hurry.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go through the trap.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
OK.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Jinxia.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Jinxia.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Jinxia.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,920
Brother.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,720
Jinxia.

127
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
Go help Master Lu.

128
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,440
No, I have to protect you.

129
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,560
It's okay, I can hold on.

130
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,160
Go.

131
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,200
Go.

132
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Go.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,760
Go.

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,600
Kill them.

135
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,360
Uncle Kai, Dr. Lin.

136
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,960
You...

137
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,680
Don't be afraid.

138
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,760
These snakes won't hurt you.

139
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,480
Retreat.

140
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,520
Jinxia.

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
How are you?

142
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,440
I'm fine.

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Don't worry.

144
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,840
Where are Da Yan and Shangguan?

145
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,800
With Senior Sister's skills,

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,360
those killers should be safe.

147
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,040
But we haven't seen them yet.

148
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,960
Could something happen?

149
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
Let's search around.

150
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,120
Go.

151
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,880
The traces of fighting disappeared.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,240
Oh my god.

153
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
What should we do now?

154
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,360
Jinxia.

155
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,920
Jinxia.

156
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
Go back to Yangzhou and arrange for the government to find them.

157
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,640
Okay.

158
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,480
After we go back,

159
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
Xie Xiao is right.

160
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,080
You go back now.

161
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,240
Don't worry.

162
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,320
I'll take care of Ling'er.

163
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,800
Yes, you go back now.

164
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,480
Uncle, Master.

165
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,600
How about you go back with us?

166
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,720
Feng Ling'er is not safe anymore.

167
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes.

168
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,800
Jinxia is still sick.

169
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,360
Don't hesitate.

170
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,120
Go.

171
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Okay, we'll go with you.

172
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Go.

173
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Go.

174
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,240
Come.

175
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Slow down.

176
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,440
It's okay.

177
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
What happened is...

178
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
Lizlang fonts the votes.

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,320
Lizlang fonts the votes.

180
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,320
Lady Shangguan!

181
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,740
Lady Shangguan!

182
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,200
Shang...

183
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,680
Lady Shangguan.

184
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,860
Lady Shangguan.

185
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,120
Lady Shangguan.

186
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,220
Lady Shangguan.

187
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,400
Miss Shangguan.

188
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,720
Miss Shangguan.

189
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,280
Miss Shangguan, wake up.

190
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Don't scare me.

191
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,480
Miss Shangguan.

192
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,880
Help!

193
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
Help!

194
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,640
Miss Shangguan, wake up.

195
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,400
Miss Shangguan.

196
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,120
Wait for me.

197
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,160
Wait for me.

198
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,280
Miss Shangguan, wake up.

199
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
You scared me.

200
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,160
Where are we?

201
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
We fell from the cliff.

202
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,320
This is the bottom of the cliff.

203
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Be careful.

204
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
The bottom of the cliff?

205
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,840
Yes.

206
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,520
The bottom of the cliff is deep.

207
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
It's deep.

208
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,560
It's deep.

209
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,600
It's deep.

210
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,560
It's deep.

211
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,520
It's deep.

212
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,440
It's deep.

213
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
It's deep.

214
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Yes.

215
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,640
Thank you, Yang Yuan.

216
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,360
It's okay.

217
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,680
I fainted after you fell down.

218
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,720
I let you lie down here and rest.

219
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,400
I thought we'd meet again when you wake up.

220
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,720
What happened to your arm?

221
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,320
It's hurt.

222
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,280
It's hurt.

223
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,280
It's hurt.

224
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,280
It's hurt.

225
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,240
It's hurt.

226
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
It's hurt.

227
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,200
What's wrong?

228
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm fine.

229
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,720
I hurt my arm when I fell down from the cliff.

230
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,640
Is it serious?

231
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm fine.

232
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,920
I'm fine.

233
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
I...

234
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,600
Yang Yuan.

235
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,520
Why are you so hot?

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm fine.

237
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,680
Miss Shangguan.

238
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,480
Are you hurt?

239
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,880
Move a little.

240
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,320
See where it hurts.

241
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,200
I...

242
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,360
I'm fine.

243
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
You're fine.

244
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
It's good that you're fine.

245
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,920
Then I can rest assured.

246
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,120
I'm really worried.

247
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

248
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm afraid I'm useless.

249
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
I can't protect you.

250
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,240
Yang Yuan.

251
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,480
Yang Yuan.

252
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,120
Yang Yuan, wake up.

253
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,400
Yang Yuan.

254
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,280
Yang Yuan.

255
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,320
Yang Yuan.

256
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
Wake up, Yang Yuan.

257
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Yang Yuan.

258
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,240
Yang Yuan.

259
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Master.

260
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
Sir, you're back.

261
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,360
Where's my master?

262
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,360
Master Yang left a letter yesterday.

263
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,800
He asked me to give it to you.

264
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,440
My master went to visit his old friend

265
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,040
before we arrived.

266
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm worried about Yang Yuan.

267
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,400
I don't know how he is.

268
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,600
I've informed the brothers in the gang to look for him.

269
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,480
They should have news of Yang Yuan and Yang Yuan soon.

270
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,560
Dr. Lin.

271
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
I'll let you suffer today.

272
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,320
Stay here for a night.

273
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,200
Jinxia needs your care.

274
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Don't worry.

275
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll show her later.

276
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,480
Go and prepare some hot water and food.

277
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,640
Bring them to our room.

278
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,440
Yes, sir. I'll prepare them now.

279
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
You're fine.

280
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm glad you're fine.

281
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
Then I can rest assured.

282
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm really worried.

283
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

284
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm afraid I'm useless.

285
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,480
I failed to protect you.

286
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
I...

287
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,400
Yang Yuan.

288
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,960
You'll meet your husband in the future.

289
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,240
You'll be a hundred times better than him.

290
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,520
When you find your husband

291
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,960
and get married,

292
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,640
I'll sneak into the water.

293
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,360
I'll get you some wine.

294
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,960
What if I don't marry you?

295
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,160
No.

296
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,640
You're such a good girl.

297
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,640
There must be someone

298
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,680
who's very good to you.

299
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,760
Yang Yuan.

300
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,480
Yang Yuan.

301
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,160
No.

302
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,680
Run. Run. Run.

303
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Yang Yuan.

304
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Run.

305
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,440
Yang Yuan.

306
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm sure

307
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,600
there's someone.

308
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,240
Why are you so harsh to yourself?

309
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,080
Why can't you be like a normal girl?

310
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,240
You're unhappy.

311
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,520
You're angry.

312
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,440
You're waiting for someone to coax you.

313
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,920
Robbers.

314
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,720
Master.

315
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,680
Master.

316
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,920
Master.

317
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,000
Master.

318
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,200
Master.

319
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,840
Master.

320
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,960
Master! Master!

321
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,160
Master! Master!

322
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,840
Master! Master!

323
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,520
Yuan Daxia, don't be so sad.

324
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,080
How about I take you to eat something delicious?

325
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
I don't want to eat.

326
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,800
But I haven't got any news from Shangguan.

327
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,000
Then you can't skip the meal.

328
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,720
And you can't solve any problem if you're sad.

329
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,680
Don't worry. I've sent people to find him.

330
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,280
They must have news tomorrow.

331
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,840
What's wrong?

332
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,840
Don't come over.

333
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,320
Mao Haifeng.

334
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
Mao Haifeng?

335
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,240
He's here.

336
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,240
I'll skin him alive.

337
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,680
Don't be so careless. Let me see.

338
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
Miss, be careful.

339
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Zhai Leye?

340
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,280
Why is he with these pirates?

341
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,400
Miss Zhai.

342
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,880
Please.

343
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,560
I knew Zhai Leye is not easy.

344
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,640
I didn't expect that he had contact with Mao Haifeng

345
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,960
except Yan Shi Fan.

346
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,120
Should we go after him?

347
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
What are you talking about?

348
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,720
Don't be so careless.

349
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,800
Let's discuss with Master Lu before we make a decision.

350
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,880
Why?

351
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,000
Why should we discuss everything with him?

352
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,240
This is Yangzhou.

353
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,600
This is my territory.

354
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,760
Master Lu is an official.

355
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,680
You're a civilian.

356
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Who are you listening to?

357
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Master, he's a civilian.

358
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,360
Suspect Lu Yanzhi is��추

359
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,240
but the marquis stillley won't let reformer to escape.

360
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,080
My lord,

361
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,320
the low 진짜D еilippus of appearance comes to Conservatory.

what this annoying kid does.

368
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,920
How's the emperor?

369
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,240
Tediously.

370
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,600
But it's theacle of cultivation.

371
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,760
Sir, I just went in and saw him and Xie Xiao going out together.

372
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,400
I'll go find them.

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,840
I got it.

374
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
Find them quickly.

375
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,480
And set off as soon as possible.

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,840
Yes.

377
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,760
Jinxia, don't be so anxious.

378
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,000
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

379
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,920
It's a long story.

380
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,920
They must have some unspeakable relationship.

381
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,360
I have to tell Lord Lu as soon as possible.

382
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,120
Maybe they left at that time.

383
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,560
It's the signal from Wuwan Gang.

384
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,880
It seems that Yang Yue and Senior Sister have news.

385
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
Really?

386
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,920
Let's go find them quickly.

387
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,080
What about Zhai Lanye and Mao Haifeng?

388
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,440
Even if we go to find Lu now,

389
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,800
we can only discuss it.

390
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,280
We can't do anything to them.

391
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,120
Let's go.

392
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,720
Don't be anxious.

393
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,320
Sir, Yuan Bukai and Xie Xiao went to Wuwan Gang.

394
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,480
There seems to be an emergency there.

395
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,000
But I don't know the details of the gathering.

396
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,080
No, we can't wait.

397
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,200
Let's set off immediately.

398
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,320
Go prepare.

399
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,680
Yes.

400
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,240
I was so anxious when you disappeared.

401
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,680
If you really have a long story,

402
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,240
how can I tell Master?

403
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,800
Where is my father?

404
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,920
Does he know that I'm injured?

405
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,720
He went to visit his old friend.

406
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,160
He left a letter asking us to go back early.

407
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
What's wrong?

408
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
You don't want to go back?

409
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm afraid that I can't go back.

410
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm afraid that I can't go back.

411
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,440
I'm afraid that I can't go back.

412
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,520
Are you reluctant to leave Sister Shangguan?

413
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,760
You...

414
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,640
By the way,

415
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,960
you two were alone yesterday.

416
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,960
Did anything happen?

417
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,120
No, don't...

418
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,600
Okay, okay.

419
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,400
Don't talk nonsense.

420
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,280
I'm a man.

421
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
If others hear it,

422
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,480
they'll ruin Miss Shangguan's reputation.

423
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
I know.

424
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,560
But if you really like Sister Shangguan,

425
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,120
you can chase her.

426
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,080
How about this?

427
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
I'll tell Xie Yuan Yuan later

428
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
to let you stay in Wuwan Gang to recuperate.

429
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,280
You and Sister Shangguan

430
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,920
are connected by the connection.

431
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,560
You must be able to meet each other.

432
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,560
You...

433
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,680
Don't move. Don't move.

434
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,040
Don't thank me.

435
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,280
You're my brother.

436
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
Come on, let me feed you.

437
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,680
Come on, let me feed you.

438
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,360
Come out!

439
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,600
Come out!

440
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
Come out!

441
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,720
You're lying!

442
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,680
You're lying!

443
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,720
You're lying!

444
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Haha!

445
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,040
Don't fight!

446
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,040
Don't fight!

447
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Sons!

448
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,240
Don't fight!

449
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,040
Why are you three messing with me?

450
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Don't fight!

451
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,880
Don't fight!

452
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,440
Don't fight!

453
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,520
Don't beat me!

454
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,840
Dudes, please speak expecting me!

455
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,640
Don't beat me!

456
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,120
Television presence.

457
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,960
Say it nicely.

458
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Talk nicely!

459
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,560
Don't fight!

460
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,760
Talking nicely!

461
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,520
Are you terrely!

462
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,720
A little quiet!

463
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,600
Stop them!

464
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,600
Shut up!

465
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,080
Don't fight!

466
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,360
Stop fighting!

467
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,000
Master, Xiao Lan.

468
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
Stop fighting.

469
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Stop.

470
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,360
You don't know the rules, right?

471
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,760
Yes.

472
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,360
Master.

473
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,160
Master.

474
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,960
You...

475
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,760
Run.

476
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,560
Master.

477
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,360
Get down.

478
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,760
Stop fighting.

479
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,360
What's wrong?

480
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,240
Master.

481
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm sorry.

482
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,520
Master.

483
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,160
Master.

484
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,920
Stop fighting.

485
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
Stop.

486
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
You're not going to win.

487
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,640
Do you know what to do now?

488
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,080
Yes.

489
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,200
Stop fighting.

490
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
Stop fighting.

491
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,600
You're not allowed to teach me.

492
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,520
Go to the temple.

493
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Go.

494
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,920
Go.

495
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,320
Go.

496
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Let him go.

497
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,920
Wait.

498
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,840
We'll come back tomorrow.

499
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,200
Brother Lu.

500
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,920
You're the guard who escorted my master to the capital.

501
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,360
We're fated to meet.

502
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Xiao Lan.

503
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,600
Xiao Lan.

504
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,360
By the way, let me introduce you.

505
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,440
This is my master, Master Yuan Ming.

506
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,360
This is my junior, Er Pang, Sanshou.

507
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,560
Master.

508
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,400
This is my good friend when I went down the mountain.

509
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,920
Lu Yi.

510
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,680
Master Lu.

511
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,880
Guard Jin Yi.

512
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,760
Lord Wu Liang.

513
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,360
I, Yuan Ming, meet Master Lu here.

514
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,720
Master Lu.

515
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,720
My master is innocent.

516
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,120
He was wronged.

517
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,080
If he goes up the mountain without a reason,

518
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,040
he will be in danger.

519
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm just following orders.

520
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,120
If the case of the pill has nothing to do with you,

521
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,360
I can guarantee your safety.

522
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,120
Great.

523
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,920
Master.

524
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,120
Lord Lu is just.

525
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,480
He will clear your name.

526
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
I thank you.

527
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,960
Thank you.

528
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Please don't stand on ceremony.

529
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,720
Please pack up your luggage and come to the capital with us.

530
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,120
Lord Lu.

531
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,400
I have a favor to ask.

532
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,920
Can you give me a few days?

533
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,440
I will deal with the affairs of the cabinet.

534
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,880
I will go to the capital with you immediately.

535
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,560
This time,

536
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,680
I will come back from the far away.

537
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,080
I don't know when I will come back.

538
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,760
Master.

539
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Life and death are up to fate.

540
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,240
You and I are cultivators.

541
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,160
Can't you see this?

542
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
But.

543
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,640
Master Lu.

544
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Lord Lu.

545
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,080
Please give my master a few days.

546
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,320
If so,

547
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
then I will wait for another day.

548
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Tomorrow morning,

549
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,680
we'll go back to the capital together.

550
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,520
Thank you, Lord Lu.

551
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,720
Thank you, Lord Lu.

552
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Thank you.

553
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,920
During this time,

554
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,520
in order to avoid accidents,

555
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,600
no one in Dan Qing Pavilion can leave.

556
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,480
I will also be here to see you.

557
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,760
I will send more guards to protect you

558
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,160
to prevent what happened today from happening again.

559
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Thank you, Lord Lu.

560
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,840
Xia Lan, hurry and clean up a room for Lord Lu.

561
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,000
Lord Wei Qu, stay here for one more day.

562
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Okay.

563
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,680
Brother Lu, this way, please.

564
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Lord Lu, you're still alive after being poisoned so badly.

565
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
You're really lucky.

566
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Maybe it's because I'm not destined to die.

567
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I was wrong before.

568
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
If I had known you were a guard,

569
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,480
I wouldn't have dared to fool you.

570
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,480
By the way, where are Miss Yuan and Brother Xie?

571
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,480
They are in Yangzhou now.

572
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,480
That girl didn't eat much to save you, right?

573
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Be careful, Lord!

574
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Jingxia, in order to save Lu Yi,

575
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,480
she had Ling'er plant snake poison in her body.

576
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
She was poisoned with poison.

577
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Jingxia. Jingxia.

578
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,480
This poison was made from seven poisonous plants.

579
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
It's very poisonous.

580
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Whether it can be cured or not

581
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
depends on her luck.

582
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
What's wrong?

583
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Something wrong?

584
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Master Lan is still the same as before.

585
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
He likes to ask about others' privacy.

586
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Lord Lu,

587
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
don't tell my master

588
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,480
about me watching the film outside.

589
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
He's old.

590
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
He's not a good person.

591
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
He's old.

592
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,480
I'm afraid he can't stand this excitement.

593
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
It's easy to say.

594
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
But,

595
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
why is it so quiet here?

596
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
I haven't been back for a long time.

597
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Who would have thought that I would be back and have this kind of time.

598
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
In the past half year,

599
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
most of my brothers have left.

600
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Now that Master is in trouble,

601
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
the rest of them are afraid of being implicated.

602
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
They leave and leave.

603
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Let's talk about it.

604
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Do you know the rules?

605
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Please.

606
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
How is it?

607
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Our inn is not bad.

608
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
I'll make you a bed.

609
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Master.

610
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Brother Lu, why are you here?

611
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
How is it?

612
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Are you okay with your master?

613
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes.

614
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Xiao Xin,

615
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
I told you

616
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
that you need to rest in the room.

617
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Why don't you listen to me?

618
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Yes.

619
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Where's Sister Jin Xia?

620
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
She didn't come.

621
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
You only know about her.

622
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Yes.

623
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Master Lu,

624
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
there's a person named Yuan Jin Xia at the door.

625
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
It's Sister Jin Xia.

626
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I know.

627
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Yes.

628
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
What are you thinking about?

629
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
You're so careless.

630
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
If you don't want your master to know

631
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
about your achievements,

632
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
you'd better talk less with me.

633
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
What do you mean by hard bed?

634
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I really don't know you.

635
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
We're here to find someone.

636
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Why don't you believe me?

637
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Can you give me some water first?

638
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,480
I told you that I know Master Lu.

639
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
You really don't have any...

640
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Master.

641
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
What's wrong with the Imperial Guards?

642
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Master,

643
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,480
I mean you're really good.

644
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
You're loyal and good.

645
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
I admire you.

646
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Sister Jin Xia,

647
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
I admire you.

648
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Sister Jin Xia.

649
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Xiao Xi,

650
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
why are you here?

651
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,480
This is Master's home.

652
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Master?

653
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Miss Yuan.

654
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Thank you.

655
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
You're lying.

656
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
You're not a fake方式.

657
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,480
When did I say I'm a fake方式?

658
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
By the way,

659
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
why are you here?

660
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Of course I'm here to find Master Lu.

661
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Master,

662
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Sister Shang Guan and Dayang are fine.

663
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
I thought that

664
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Mao Hai Feng and Zha Lan Ye are very important.

665
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
So I came to tell you.

666
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Good job.

667
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Thank you for your compliment.

668
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Master,

669
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
they left Yangzhou after meeting.

670
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
The ear of the Wu An Gang found that

671
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
they've already gone to Hangzhou.

672
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I know.

673
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Come on.

674
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Have a taste.

675
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
The oranges and sweet potatoes planted by Dan Qing Pavilion.

676
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Okay.

677
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I'll go and have a look.

678
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Okay.

679
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
Sweet potatoes.

680
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Okay.

681
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Don't lie when you eat.

682
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Liar Lan,

683
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
you're really thoughtful.

684
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Miss,

685
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
can you give me another name?

686
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Save me some face

687
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
in Dan Qing Pavilion.

688
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Lan Lan.

689
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Lan.

690
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
You're still as funny as before.

691
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
It's true.

692
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
You still look funny

693
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
after a long absence.

694
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
Master Yuan,

695
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
if you don't know how to use idioms,

696
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
don't use them anymore.

697
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
What?

698
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
You even

699
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:10,480
re-enact your own subordinates' words and

700
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
say whatever you want.

701
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
I only listen to you.

702
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Master,

703
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
you should have a good rest.

704
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
We'll go to have a rest, too.

705
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Lan,

706
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
take us to visit Dan Qing Pavilion.

707
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Okay.

708
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Let's go.

709
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
I'll take you to see your house.

710
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I'll borrow the books.

711
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Go.

712
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
It's okay.

713
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
I'll go first.

714
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Let's go.

715
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Master, have a good rest.

716
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Stay here.

717
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Thank you.

718
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Close the door.

719
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Coming.

720
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
It's just

721
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
an adult.

722
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Help!

723
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Help!

724
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Uncle Er Pao,

725
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
he's not going to make it!

726
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
What's wrong, Xiao Xing?

727
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
What's wrong?

728
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Uncle Er Pao,

729
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
he's

730
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
dead.

731
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Let's go.

732
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Come with me.

733
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
It's in that room.

734
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Where is he?

735
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
He was lying here just now.

736
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Why did he disappear?

737
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Are you sure?

738
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
What's wrong?

739
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
What's wrong?

740
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
It smells like a new book.

741
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Master.

742
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
What's wrong?

743
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Master.

744
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
What's going on?

745
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Master.

746
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Sir.

747
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Xiao Xing just said

748
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
that Master Er Pao was lying on the ground and dead.

749
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
But when we came in,

750
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
he disappeared.

751
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Xiao Xing,

752
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
we, the cultivators,

753
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
can't be reckless.

754
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
This...

755
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
This...

756
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
How can a good person

757
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
disappear so easily?

758
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
I just came in

759
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
and saw Master Er Pao

760
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
lying on the ground.

761
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
No.

762
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Tell us clearly.

763
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
What happened?

764
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Tell us.

765
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
Tonight,

766
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
he said that you were not.

767
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
I made him some porridge.

768
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
I just came in.

769
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
No.

770
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
What happened?

771
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Xiao Xing,

772
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
don't cry or be afraid.

773
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Tell me,

774
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
what did you see?

775
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I saw Master Er Pao

776
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
lying on the ground.

777
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I saw a person

778
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
lying on the ground.

779
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Who is it?

780
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Look carefully.

781
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Did you see his face?

782
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
I didn't.

783
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Okay.

784
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Don't cry.

785
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Okay.

786
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
He is still a child.

787
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Ask him.

788
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
What can you ask?

789
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
How about this?

790
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
I'll take him back first.

791
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Okay.

792
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Xiao Xing.

793
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Okay.

794
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Master San Shou is too scared.

795
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Take him back.

796
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Let's go.

797
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Let's go.

798
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Master.

799
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Does Master Er Pao

800
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
offend anyone?

801
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
I don't know.

802
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
In fact,

803
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Dan Qing Ge

804
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
is usually very quiet.

805
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
He rarely goes out.

806
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Let alone

807
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
making trouble.

808
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Could it be

809
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
that a coward entered?

810
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
But the Imperial Guards

811
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
are guarding here.

812
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
How did they get in?

813
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Master, don't worry.

814
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I will find out.

815
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Okay.

816
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Then,

817
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
thank you, Lord Lu.

818
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
I'll go and see some disciples.

819
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Okay.

820
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
Lord.

821
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Did the body disappear?

822
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
How could it be?

823
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
Lord.

824
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Let's assume

825
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
that Xiao Xing is telling the truth.

826
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Master Er Pao

827
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
really died in this room.

828
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
What about the body?

829
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
How did the murderer

830
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
transfer the body?

831
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
He didn't have time

832
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
and there are no traces

833
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
of the body here.

834
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
If we assume

835
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
that Master Er Pao didn't die,

836
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
how could he have been

837
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
transferred to this room?

838
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
If we assume

839
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
that Master Er Pao didn't die,

840
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
we can actually say that.

841
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
This room is not damaged

842
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
and there are no

843
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
signs of fierce fighting.

844
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Except for this bowl,

845
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
the porridge Xiao Xing

846
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
had when he came in.

847
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
But Xiao Xing

848
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
wouldn't lie.

849
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
It seems that

850
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,480
someone wants to stop

851
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
the escorting of Yuan Ming.

852
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Whether Master Er Pao

853
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
is dead or not,

854
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
the Imperial Guards

855
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
won't restrain the imperial guards.

856
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Officer Yuan,

857
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
you must be careful

858
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
and protect Master Yuan Ming.

859
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Sir.

860
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
How is it?

861
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
I have arranged people

862
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
to secretly block the way

863
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
to the five miles of Danjing Pavilion.

864
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,480
The possibility of the murderer

865
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
escaping is not big.

866
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Is there any secret passage?

867
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
I haven't found it yet.

868
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Sir,

869
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
will you return to the capital

870
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
according to the plan tomorrow morning?

871
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
First, the elixir

872
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
from Danjing Pavilion

873
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
was problematic.

874
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Now, the way

875
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
of Danjing Pavilion

876
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
has disappeared.

877
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Who is the one

878
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
who is behind this?

879
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
No hurry.

880
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
We can keep a few more people.

881
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
I want to see

882
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
who is the one

883
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
who dares to

884
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
do evil under the eyes

885
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
of the Imperial Guards.

886
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Is it still painful?

887
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
It's still a little bit painful,

888
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
but it's much better.

889
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Jinxia asked you

890
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
to rest here

891
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
and wait for your father to come back.

892
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
He went to Danjing Pavilion

893
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
to find my grandson.

894
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Why did he leave so suddenly?

895
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
It's boring to stay in the post.

896
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
That's right.

897
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
With Jinxia's character,

898
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
she can't be idle.

899
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
By the way,

900
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
I have a question.

901
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
By the way, Dr. Lin,

902
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
when can I stop

903
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
using this cloth?

904
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
It's inconvenient

905
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
to wrap it every day.

906
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
It's almost recovered.

907
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
It will be removed in two days.

908
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
That's great.

909
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Dr. Lin,

910
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Senior.

911
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
It's good that it's inconvenient.

912
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Miss Shangguan,

913
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
we have changed the medicine

914
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
for Yang Yue.

915
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
We have something else to do.

916
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
We'll leave now.

917
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Let's have some tea before leaving.

918
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
No need.

919
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
We really have something to do.

920
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
We'll leave now.

921
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Come to me if you need anything.

922
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

923
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Thank you, Uncle Gai.

924
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Take care.

925
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Miss Shangguan.

926
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
I picked two clothes for you.

927
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
You can try them later.

928
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
If they don't fit,

929
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
I'll change them.

930
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Miss Shangguan,

931
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
thank you for your concern.

932
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
It's my pleasure.

933
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
The food is getting cold.

934
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
You haven't eaten yet?

935
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
I was changing the medicine.

936
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
I didn't have time to eat.

937
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
I'll eat now.

938
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,480
I forgot that your hand is inconvenient.

939
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
How is it?

940
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Is it good?

941
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
I've never had

942
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
such a delicious meal.

943
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
What's wrong?

944
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Is it salty or light?

945
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
It's perfect.

946
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Perfect.

947
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
That's good.

948
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,600
And just because of that burglary memory,

949
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:41,100
learning the duties of the

950
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
How could such a strange thing happen?

951
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,100
Don't say that.

952
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,980
Think about the scenery of Dan Qingge.

953
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,020
It's so boring.

954
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,020
Now,

955
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
we can go.

956
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,100
The rain falls, I'm lost.

957
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,100
My mind is messed up.

958
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,700
The wind blows, I'm shocked.

959
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,780
My heart is empty.

960
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,060
Thousands of miles of ambush come and go.

961
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,500
Who is out of the mountain?

962
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,180
The fate is hard to compare with.

963
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:41,180
I can see your face when I close my eyes.

964
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Open your eyes, the back is cold.

965
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,180
The sword is full of sky.

966
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:54,180
Who has conquered the world?

967
00:43:54,580 --> 00:44:00,180
No sound, the sword rises.

968
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,180
The fate is hard to compare with.

969
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:14,180
I want to say goodbye.

970
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:20,180
I miss you.

971
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,180
I want to meet you.

972
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:33,180
The white hair in the sky is like the years we spent together.

973
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:39,180
I look back and think of you.

974
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:03,180
The Long Ballad

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,180
