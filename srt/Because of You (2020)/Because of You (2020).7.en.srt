♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,670
♫ I can't face it or avoid it ♫

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,070
♫ I can only stand there and watch him leave ♫

♫ I can hear the sound of my heart breaking ♫

00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,430

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,990
Yan Yuewu, if you dare to do anything to Xiangshi, I will be after your whole family.

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,670
I'm late.

15
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,650
Not really. We were having ramen.

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,930
-Ramen after sex?
-No, just eating.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
What's that on your neck?

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Oh, I did that on accident.

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,630
Yan Yuewu, what did you do to Xiangshi?

20
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,680
She was just drunk. She was only playing.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,060
Look how nervous you are. Other people would think you are here to catch him cheating on you.

22
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,380
Nothing happened between us.

23
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,200
Don't worry, Xiaoshi and I are into different things.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,910
We are both tops.

25
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,270
My head hurts from rolling around. Didn't even get to do anything.

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,630
So you guys were half way there?

27
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,570
As long as I didn't get to enjoy it, it doesn't count.

28
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,410
Stop yelling.

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,860
We are leaving. Goodbye. Let's go.

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,070
Bye. See you next time.

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,970
Yang Xianghsi, be honest with me.

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,220
Were you guys really just did half of it?

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,530
Nothing. We were only playing.

34
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,490
What's with the hickie then?

35
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,220
She was drunk at first.

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,740
Then, she sobered up and we had food. That's it.

37
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
-You are lying to me.
-I smelled perfume on you last time.

38
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,410
You guys did go on a date,

39
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,020
but you were lying and said you were fixing her computer.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,700
-I didn't.
-How many times are you going to lie to me?

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,690
Say it.

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,360
-What are you doing?
-What are you going to do?

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,070
I've always been the one backing down when you get angry.

44
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,480
Not this time.

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,090
-You pushed me.
-That's right. I pushed you.

46
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,320
Do you really think you can fight me?

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,920
-Let go of me.
-No! You are mine!

48
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm not.

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,630
You eat here, and you sleep here. My family owns you.

50
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,340
That's right. I eat here and I sleep here.

51
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,820
But it doesn't mean that I'm a pet dog here.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,500
Goodbye.

53
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,650
Yang Xiangshi.

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,520
What?

55
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm sorry. Please don't leave, ok? Stay.

56
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,650
I said the wrong thing.

57
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,120
Thanks for reminding me of my status here.

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,340
I'm a grown-up now.

59
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,560
I should be gone.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,820
Don't go. Come back.

61
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,070
I'm...I'm sorry.

62
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,550
I shouldn't have hurt you like that.

63
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,970
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,470
It was all because

65
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,030
that I need you so much.

66
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,390
Please move, Lord Yuan. I need to go to work.

68
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,390
Come home with me.

69
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,890
It's proven through my DNA that

70
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,070
I am not related to the Yuan family. Why are you asking me to go home with you?

71
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,620
My dad has agreed to adopt you.

72
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,690
Thanks, but I don't want to be adopted by you guys.

73
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,500
Why not? You get lots of money as my brother.

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,470
You don't have to go to work anymore.

75
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,680
I don't want money. I want my freedom.

76
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,120
Freedom?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,300
That's right.

78
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,620
I can live freely and ride freely.

79
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,220
I get to love freely.

80
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,250
Love freely.

81
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,950
So you want to be in love.

82
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,610
With anyone?

83
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,310
Of course.

84
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,820
How can I love freely if I'm your brother?

85
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,970
Either a guy or a girl?

86
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,190
Anyone.

87
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,970
Even guys or girls.

88
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,850
If that so.

89
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,400
What if it's with me?

90
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,940
-Sure.
-Really?

91
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,170
No, I was saying that.

92
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,890
So you want to be in love with me, right?

93
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,320
What are you talking about?

94
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,870
Or else,

95
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,540
why don't you want to be my brother?

96
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,210
Eh.

97
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,710
I was

98
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,010
saying that

99
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,050
there are too many rules to be part of the Yuan family.

100
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,200
And it's not a lot of freedom.

101
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,030
Eh.

102
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,300
I just want to be myself.

103
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,410
Why are you taking a shower this early, Yan Yuerong?

104
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,620
What?

105
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,060
Tell you what.

106
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,980
I was so close to having sex with Yang Xiangshi yesterday.

107
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,720
But Yuan Jundao

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,150
treated him like a boy toy.

109
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,460
He looked like he was going to eat me alive if I touch Xiangshi.

110
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,060
I can't stand him.

111
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,790
Hey, lend me your shampoo.

112
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,140
Sister Yuewu.

113
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,020
The third son of, Yuan Junping.

114
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,270
Wow.

115
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,130
Your skin is so fair.

116
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,060
You are also in good shape

117
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,130
and good-looking.

118
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,680
No wonder you are so popular at school.

119
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
Sister Yuewu.

120
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,070
Could you not look at me like that?

121
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm a little afraid.

122
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,290
What are you afraid of?

123
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,370
-Are you afraid that I'm going to eat you?
-Sister!

124
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,560
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
What are you doing?

127
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,380
Sister,

128
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,540
you scared Yuan Junping

129
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,160
-when you sneaked in like that.
-So what?

130
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,290
-At least knock.
-But I'm always like that.

131
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,920
However,

132
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,470
why is Yuan Junping taking a shower in our house?

133
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,880
We were playing basketball, so I let him shower here.

134
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,740
Hey, Junping.

135
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,590
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,750
Sister Yuewu, I'm sorry. I should've locked the door.

137
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,980
It's ok. It's nice to leave the door unlocked.

138
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,150
Sit. Sit.

139
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,240
Also,

140
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,300
I heard you mentioning my second brother when I was in the shower.

141
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,900
Even though I don't know what he did, I apologize for him to you.

142
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,800
He can be dumb sometimes.

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,430
I hope you don't mind.

144
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,870
It's ok. You apologized for him already. I will not mind.

145
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,680
It's ok. It's ok.

146
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,230
What?

147
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,130
I think Yuan Junping is quite nice.

148
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,990
You are good friends with him. Why don't you help your sister?

149
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,640
Hey, that's so sudden.

150
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,380
What's so sudden?

151
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,680
Love is very sudden.

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,990
It reminds me of a song.

153
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,120
♫ Love comes so fast, like wind. ♫

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,200
You shouldn't stay here for too long.

155
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,540
♫ There's no time to react.♫

156
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,640
Hey, Yan Yuerong.

157
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,600
Yan Yuerong, why are you running away so fast?

158
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm so tired.

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,170
A bun.

160
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,260
It smells delicious.

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,180
No.

162
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Why is there a feast here?

163
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,930
Stop eating buns.

164
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,730
Come on, have a good meal.

165
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,620
Mr. Yuancheng.

166
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,770
When are you going to stop stalking me?

167
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,220
Didn't I tell you that

168
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,520
I'm not going to be your family's adopted son?

169
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,580
I know.

170
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,650
You want freedom. The freedom to love.

171
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,840
-So you know.
-But you still have to eat.

172
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,610
Let's eat.

173
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,640
No.

174
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,260
If I eat this well, what am I going to do when I get used to it?

175
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,770
Don't worry.

176
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,770
I will feed you with good food every day,

177
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,780
as long as you work for me.

178
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,840
10,000 per hour.

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,330
-10,000?
-Yes. Ok?

180
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,260
No. No way.

181
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,710
No prey was ever

182
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,240
able to run away from me.

183
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,010
I'm standing right in front of you.

184
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,100
Why don't you just get it over with? I prefer it's just one shot.

185
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,070
Have you ever seen a prey making the hunter take the shot?

186
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,270
I don't want to die. I want you alive.

187
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,860
Why aren't you making sense?

188
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,930
Have you asked me if I want to be your prey?

189
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,860
Have you ever heard of a hunter asking for a prey's permission?

190
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,520
What do you want?

191
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,180
I have nothing valuable on me.

192
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,070
What, you want my body?

193
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,160
Do you like guys?

194
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,760
I don't know. I've never tried.

195
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,650
What...

196
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,500
what about you?

197
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,470
I never tried it either.

198
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,290
The first thing they taught me in the family is how to be immune to love.

199
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,100
What are you smiling about?

200
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,540
If you want to try it, I can do it with you.

201
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,590
I'm not afraid of any challenges in this world.

202
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,500
I didn't say yes to it.

203
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,940
Is it your Chinese sucks, or is it my Korean sucks?

204
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,580
You must be hungry.

205
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,650
Go have some dinner.

206
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,940
I will take you to eat something else tomorrow.

207
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,580
Wait a second.

208
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,490
I might not like what you think is delicious.

209
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,330
I have to find it delicious.

210
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,040
Really?

211
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,430
What do you like to eat?

212
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,050
Why are you asking it? Are you going to eat with me tomorrow?

213
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

214
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,870
Ok.

215
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,110
Then you eat whatever I eat.

216
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,710
Ok. I'm not afraid of it.

217
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,150
Ok.

218
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,090
There's a great street food joint next to my place.

219
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,880
Let's go try it tomorrow?

220
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,310
Street food?

221
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,040
Where are the keys?

222
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,850
Why are you touching me?

223
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,700
What are you doing?

224
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,270
Did something really happen last night?

225
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,730
Yuan Juncheng.

226
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,040
How do you know if two guys had sex or not?

227
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,720
♫

228
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,850
♫

229
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,600
♫

230
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,910
♫  In those times, be still ♫

231
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:54,480
♫  In those times, be still ♫

232
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,480
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

233
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,880
♫ It's not the end ♫

234
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,410
♫ We can start again ♫

235
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,150
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

236
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:24,890
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

237
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,150
♫  I will run on this path ♫

238
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:34,520
♫  that I've chosen ♫

239
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:45,780
♫  that I've chosen ♫
