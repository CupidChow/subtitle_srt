00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,980
♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,630
♫ I can't face it or fun away ♫

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:17,120
♫ I can only stand there to watch him leave ♫

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,840
♫ I can hear my heart break ♫

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,500
♫ We are both in love ♫

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,260
♫ But I'm willing to give up because of our friendship ♫

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,470
♫ I don't want to see him sad and suffer ♫

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:41,480
♫ His tears makes my heart ache ♫

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,030
♫ Love makes us give up everything ♫

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,220
♫ Protecting him makes me happy ♫

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:57,010
♫ The realm of love only allows for two people ♫

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,930
♫ Please love him well for me ♫

13
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,150
-Uncle, have you eaten yet?
-No.

14
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,690
No?

15
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,300
-Take all of this.
-Thank you.

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,600
What. He's going around being friendly with homeless people like this?

17
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,570
Did I find the wrong guy?

18
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,070
I gave out all my money.

19
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,920
I only have this tea egg to eat again.

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,770
That's his first meal today?

21
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Hey, boss.

23
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,760
The funeral is finished.

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,320
Yes, I am available today.

25
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,180
What now?

26
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,390
I wonder who's passed away?

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,750
Mom,

28
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,970
I will be alright.

29
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,360
Get it together! Let's make some money.

30
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,850
Lin Xun is our senior.

31
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,010
Do you know him?

32
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,420
No.

33
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,600
But he was famous when he got in.

34
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,880
He was a genius who got a perfect score.

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,040
Genius.

36
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,790
Let me see.

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,490
You have so much information about him.

38
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,660
Do you have a crush on him?

39
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,310
I do not. I only did it so that I can talk to him.

40
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,110
But you must wait for him to come to class.

41
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,130
I heard that he is doing a part-time job
to pay his mom's medical expenses.

42
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,580
If she was my dad's mistress,

43
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,310
my dad would have given her a lot of money.

44
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,850
Her son wouldn't have to work.

45
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,700
Also think about it,

46
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,940
they would have earned a lot

47
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,690
just by selling the story to the tabloid.

48
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,470
-We can talk loud here. Let's go outside.
-Okay, Let's go.

49
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,780
It's so strange.

50
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,220
Mr.Yuan wouldn't be so cold
to have his own son suffering out there.

51
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,250
Maybe...

52
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,120
he just found out about him.

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,100
Maybe Lin Xun's mom never wanted Mr.Yuan
to know about his son.

54
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,470
Unless...

55
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,280
there's a reason.

56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,010
What reason?

57
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,050
I don't know yet.

58
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,260
We might need to sneak into his apartment to find out.

59
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,980
How are we gonna do that?

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,700
How many times do I have to tell you?
Don't bite your nails!

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,010
Oh.

62
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,850
Why do you bite it? Does it taste good or what?

63
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,990
It hurts.

64
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,200
It does taste good.

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,300
It's not about the taste.

66
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,700
It inspires me.

67
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,750
You can bite mine.

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,800
No, nobody wants your nails.

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
Do you want it?

70
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,100
No! Eww!

71
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,820
How unlucky that bastard must be

72
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,460
to have a father like that.

73
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,680
Xiangshi?

74
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,370
Weird. It's this late and he is still not home yet.

75
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,450
Alright, you can continue live streaming now.

76
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,890
Great.

77
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,100
How can I repay you?

78
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:09,680
You don't have to bother. We are relatives, cousin.

79
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
Don't call me cousin.

80
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,230
My cousin's ex-wife

81
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,800
married your cousin. That's all.

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,500
Emm.

83
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,130
Cousin...

84
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,070
Call my name.

85
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,410
Yue Wu or Wu'er are both fine.

86
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,210
It must be Jundao.

87
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,860
Wait!

88
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,940
What are you doing?

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,900
Smells good, doesn't it?

90
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,700
I am curious how Yuan Jundao would react when he smells it.

91
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,150
Crazy.

92
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,400
Why isn't he picking up? Is he being kidnapped?

93
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,860
I'm back.

94
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,510
Where have you been?

95
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,820
I was worried about you being kidnapped.

96
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,680
Who would kidnap me other than you?

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,870
Alright. Let me kidnap you.

98
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,480
Confess! Where were you?

99
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,950
It doesn't matter. I am home now.

100
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,730
Wait.

101
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,570
What's this smell?

102
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,950
Nothing. You smelled wrong.

103
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,840
Tell me.

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,110
Who were you on a date with?

105
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,710
It wasn't a date. I was fixing my friend's computer.

106
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,060
How would that give you this smell?
Do you think I am dumb?

107
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,800
It's true!

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,500
I am going to my room.

109
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,100
Yang Xiangshi, stop!

110
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,160
Ah.

111
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,290
What are you doing?

112
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,040
-Did you get hurt?
-Don't touch me!

113
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,610
Xiangshi, let me help you.

114
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,470
Why did your dad call you three today?

115
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,150
He wanted us to find his bastard for him.

116
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,650
Whoever finds the bastard will be rewarded with his promise.

117
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,540
Including the position of CEO.

118
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,460
Then your eldest brother probably won't let go of this opportunity.

119
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,050
Right. But I want to give it up immediately.

120
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,220
I am not finding his bastard for him.

121
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,230
Why are you wrapped in my blanket?

122
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,820
I'm cold.

123
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,690
Go shower then.

124
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,240
If you take a hot shower you won't be cold anymore.

125
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,000
Let me help ice your leg first.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,710
Sit.

127
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,260
You're holding onto a bag of ice of course you would feel cold.

128
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,960
I did it because of you.

129
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,820
How is it? Feeling better?

130
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,250
Hey, I'm sorry.

131
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,730
I should have told you that I would be late for home.

132
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,960
It's fine, we're best friends.

133
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,000
Why do you have the keys?

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,320
I made a copy.

135
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,950
Dang, you made a copy?

136
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,240
Junpin,

137
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,070
go look over there.

138
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,480
Lin Xun is working today. He's not home.

139
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,790
What did you find?

140
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,890
This is his mom's diary.

141
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,100
What was she like?

142
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,670
Her name was Chui Ying.

143
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,450
She grew up with your dad. They had a fight once.

144
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,800
She cut off her hair.

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,550
What?

146
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,080
Most women would do anything your dad says.

147
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,570
That's why your dad couldn't forget about her.

148
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,520
Why did they break up?

149
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,560
I don't know about that.

150
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,480
It only says that later on Chui Ying went into hiding.

151
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,640
And secretly gave birth to a child.

152
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,670
But your father didn't know about it.

153
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,090
So Lin Xun might actually be my brother.

154
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,710
It's pretty likely.

155
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,940
Damn it. Then I am the 4th child.

156
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,220
Hey,

157
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,910
that's not what you should be worrying about now.

158
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,840
What should I be worrying about then?

159
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,340
You should be worrying about Yuan Juncheng.

160
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,170
He's on his way to find Lin Xun too.

161
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,020
I wonder what type of person Lin Xun is.

162
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,940
Do you think...

163
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,280
he's just like my dad and my big brother?

164
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,210
Stop biting.

165
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,790
Eat your tomatoes.

166
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,390
Let's say if Lin Xun's personality...

167
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,800
is as stubborn as his mom's,

168
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,650
do you think he will go home with your big brother?

169
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,600
If Lin Xun's mom was fighting with my dad,

170
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,620
I believe Lin Xun and my brother would fight too.

171
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,030
That's right.

172
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,550
They will fight...

173
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,120
to the death...

174
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm starving.

175
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,430
Luckily I brought back some buns.

176
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,850
It seems like he really is Mr. Yuan's bastard son.

177
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,180
Big brother has already started. We must hurry.

178
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you want?

179
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,630
What are you doing?!

180
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,020
What the hell?!

181
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,070
I don't have any money!

182
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:05,460
♫  In those times, be still ♫

183
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:12,200
♫  My dreams are songs ♫

184
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:20,090
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

185
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,560
♫ It's not the end ♫

186
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,150
♫ We can start again ♫

187
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,950
♫ Let's not give up ♫

188
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:42,650
♫ If I put my all on the line ♫

189
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,960
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

190
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,160
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

191
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,620
♫  I will run on this path ♫

192
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,630
♫  that I've chosen ♫
