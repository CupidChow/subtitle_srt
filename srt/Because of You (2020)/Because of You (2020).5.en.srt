00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,990
♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,720
♫ I can't face it or avoid it ♫

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,980
♫ I can only stand there and watch him leave ♫

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,830
♫ I can hear the sound of my heart breaking ♫

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,540
♫ Because he made us both fall in love ♫

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,100
♫ I'm willing to give up for the sake of our friendship ♫

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,470
♫ I don't want to see him hurt or suffer any more ♫

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:41,510
♫ His tears make my heart ache ♫

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,030
♫ Love makes us all fearless ♫

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,070
♫ Being able to protect him is my happiness ♫

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,820
♫ The realm of love only allows for two people

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,190
♫ Please love him well for me ♫

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,150
What evidence did you find?

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,080
Lin Xun's mom's remainings.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,650
I took photos of everything.

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,470
See, the marriage certificate.

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,600
What does it proof?

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,210
Lin Xun's birthday doesn't match up
to his parents' marriage date.

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,540
Lin Xun's mom had him before getting married.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,570
Brother, Yue Rong found the evidence!

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,630
Let go of me.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,420
The marriage certificate.

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,520
Lin Xun's birthday doesn't match up
to his mother's marriage date.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,340
For real?

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,780
You were born 5 months after your parents got married.

26
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,680
So your mom was carrying you before she got married.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,390
Your dad might not be your biological father.

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,560
So...

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,690
my mom cheated on my dad?

30
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,840
No, based on the timeline,

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,660
your mom cheated on my dad.

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,940
What the hell?

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,600
Can you people from the Yuan Family make more sense?

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,370
What do we do about this?

35
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,830
Looks like this is it.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,020
How unfortunate.

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,430
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,410
If this guy is really that old man's son,

39
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,800
I can use him to find and reclaim my mother's inheritance.

40
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,560
Alright, brother.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,790
You can take this bastard to father.

42
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,710
Brother Junchen, please don't hurt him.

43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,040
You will handle the next.

44
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,840
We out.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,930
Wait! Untie me.

46
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,190
Hey, hey.

47
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,240
What are you gonna do with that?

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,620
Don't do anything crazy.

49
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,580
Let's talk it out.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,900
What are you doing? Go away!

51
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,340
Stop moving.

52
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,840
Wait.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,360
What's going on?

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,160
Why is my heart beating so fast?

55
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,670
Are you done?

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,110
I...

57
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,300
want you...?

58
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,420
What?

59
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,980
Ah!

60
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,970
I needed a sample for the DNA test.

61
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,990
Why can't you just ask nicely?

62
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,700
Because you were moving around too much!

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,180
-Can't I move my own body?
-Quiet.

64
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,250
But... why was my heart beating so fast earlier?

65
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,370
Is it because this guy is actually my real brother,

66
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,970
so we're related by blood?

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,380
Where is Lin Xun?

68
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,300
I have Lin Xun.

69
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,600
You the one who is like me the most.

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
You do things fast and clean.

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
Before you meet Lin Xun,

72
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,850
I think we need to make sure if he is really related to you by blood.

73
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,940
After all, this will affect the entire Yuan family.

74
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,280
I know my son.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,020
You can't be the one to make the judgement.

76
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,610
I have hired an investigator.

77
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,860
Based on his birthday,

78
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,120
he is the son of Cui Ying and me.

79
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,110
But father, why did you decide to find him

80
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,720
after 20 years?

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,260
Yeah.

82
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,290
Where were you when he was suffering?

83
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,020
And now you want him to call you father.

84
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,500
I wouldn't have had you if I had known of his existence.

85
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,080
Did I ever ask you to have me?

86
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,340
Alright.

87
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,710
It is not the time for this.

88
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,930
Father, is acknowledging the fact that you were too proud to reach out to Cui Ying

89
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,250
that hard to admit?

90
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,830
Dad, it's better to be discrete.

91
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,410
Our company is a Fortune 100.

92
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,000
Any family matter is a big deal.

93
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,000
This is Lin Xun's DNA test results.

94
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,700
What's the result?

95
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,780
Because you might have thought that I altered these documents,

96
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,430
I haven't opened them yet.

97
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,030
You can open it yourself.

98
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,970
But I am divorced.

99
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,110
It's too late. I am getting married.

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,970
Don't be unreasonable. Come back.

101
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,110
Yuan Weizhi,

102
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,160
I am not your dog.

103
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,210
You cannot summon me as you want
and push me away as you want.

104
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,740
There's no way you can live without me.

105
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,420
That's why I said let's bet.

106
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,320
Let's see who can live without whom.

107
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,760
-Stop being unreasonable!
-I am not the unreasonable one here.

108
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,300
Cui Ying.

109
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,880
You won't leave me.

110
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,690
You have been with me since you were 17.

111
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,000
There's no way you would be with someone else.

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,940
You don't believe it?

113
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,930
I don't believe it.

114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,620
Fine.

115
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,400
Let me tell you.

116
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,590
I will do everything I can

117
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,590
to cut you off.

118
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,830
I will make you regret

119
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,970
for the rest of your life.

120
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,100
Cui Ying!

121
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,800
You will regret forever if you leave me!

122
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,870
Let's bet, Yuan Weizhi.

123
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,000
I bet that I

124
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,380
will never see you again.

125
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,970
We will not see each other

126
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,230
till you die

127
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,800
or I die.

128
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,590
You have won.

129
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,380
Huh?

130
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,490
What?

131
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,440
Lin Xun is not my son.

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,450
He looks way too soft.

133
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,850
He is too simple to be your son.

134
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,870
What a relief.

135
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,210
It doesn't matter.

136
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,620
I can still take care of him.

137
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,690
What?

138
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,690
The problem is, Lin Xun has no desire to be your son.

139
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,050
That kid is just like his mother.

140
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,440
He wants to stay far away from you, father.

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,550
What do you know?

142
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,380
I was told that you've lost.

143
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,190
-I have not! -Father!

144
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,500
You've had three marriages and three sons. But,

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,850
because none of this turned out the way you wanted, I'm saying that you've lost.

146
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,840
Get out! All of you!

147
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,570
In order to cut you off for good,

148
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,560
I have decided

149
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,790
to not keep

150
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,370
your child.

151
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,560
This is the final bet.

152
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,470
I am betting on

153
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,130
my whole life.

154
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,140
You are betting on

155
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,940
your true love.

156
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,160
Empty home.

157
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,910
I am all alone.

158
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,630
Open the door!

159
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,770
I'm telling you to open the door!

160
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,090
How long do you plan to keep me for?

161
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,450
♫Listen to the sound of wind blowing  ♫

162
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,230
♫ It sounds like you're breathing next to me ♫

163
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:24,590
♫You made everything interesting ♫

164
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,880
♫ It only takes one second ♫

165
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,990
Looks like you are not one of us.

166
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,050
Take the money and hurry up and leave this house.

167
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,380
What did you give me this? I don't want your money.

168
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,360
♫ This is our last memory ♫

169
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,760
I don't want to owe you anything.

170
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,280
Take it.

171
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,140
You owe me so much.

172
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,790
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

173
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,590
Thank god I'm not your brother.

174
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,130
Yes.

175
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,870
It's a relief that you weren't my younger brother.

176
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,990
You don't have to speak honorifics to me anymore.

177
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,250
Take the money.

178
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,280
I said I don't want it!

179
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,950
You're always hungry and only eat eggs!

180
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,790
Take care of yourself.

181
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,850
-I like eggs.
-If I say take it, just take it!

182
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:32,140
♫I want to be with you ♫

183
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:38,470
♫Life is full of multiple choices ♫

184
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,750
Are you okay with having another older brother?

185
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,100
I want to have someone with me.

186
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,440
What do you think you're doing?

187
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,030
You have been fooling him around. How could you not know?

188
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,780
Yan Yuewu, are you crazy?

189
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,350
Help! Jundao, help me!

190
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,130
Xiang Shi!

191
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:19,050
♫  In those times, be still ♫

192
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:25,800
♫  My dreams are songs ♫

193
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,670
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

194
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,100
♫ It's not the end ♫

195
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,770
♫ We can start again ♫

196
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:49,510
♫ Let's not give up ♫

197
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:56,020
♫ If I put my all on the line ♫

198
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,370
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

199
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:05,770
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

200
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:17,110
♫  I will run on this path that I've chosen ♫
