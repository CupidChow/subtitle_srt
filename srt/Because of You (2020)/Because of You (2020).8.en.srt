♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,800
♫ I can't face it or avoid it ♫

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,070
♫ I can only stand there and watch him leave ♫

4

♫ I can hear the sound of my heart breaking ♫

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,560
♫ Because he made us both fall in love ♫

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,210

13

Alright.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,870
There's a really good food truck near my place.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,960
I love it so much.
Do you want to go tomorrow?

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,200
-Food Truck?
-Yep.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,010
Do you dare to go to eat food truck with me,
Mr. Yuan?

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,850
Okay.

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,550
Excuse me, this is the wine you ordered.

20
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,050
Sit.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,010
It's alright.

22
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,680
Excuse me, can we have the menu?

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,670
What can I get for you?

24
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,300
Let me see.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,980
Take all.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,100
All?

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,200
All?

28
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,750
Can you finish them all?

29
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,260
You are too skinny.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,520
Huh.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,810
So you are feeding your prey before you eat it, right?

32
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,080
No.

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,960
You can be too fat.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,760
You are such a control freak.

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,460
Maybe we should

36
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,250
invite your brothers over.

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,590
Brothers?

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,200
You have two brothers.

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,140
Get any one of them to eat with us.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,770
Okay.

41
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,750
It's really my brother.

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,500
Do you know what it is?

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,410
Chicken neck.

44
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,170
A young master like you would eat at a food truck?

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,580
Brother.

46
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,980
Huh.

47
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,590
Sit.

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,890
Sorry.

49
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,940
Your brother ordered too much.
I don't wanna waste any food.

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,880
So I called you for help.

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,220
It's alright.

52
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,360
But can he eat these?

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,970
He promised me that

54
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,380
he will eat everything I tell him to eat.

55
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,210
Here, have a chicken butt.

56
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,470
Hey.

57
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,360
You said

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,290
you will eat what I eat.

59
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,210
Hey!

60
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,870
Okay, okay. Let me...

61
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,190
How was it?

62
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,090
Good.

63
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,890
Here, let's have a drink.

64
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,280
Wait.

65
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,000
Our family doesn't drink.

66
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,110
No way.

67
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,020
You promised to eat with me.

68
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,120
It's just a drink.

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,900
Alright.

70
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,370
Just one.

71
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,740
Bro.

72
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,490
Your brother drank with me.

73
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,080
You have no excuse to say no now.

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,770
Here, you too.

75
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,480
Come on.

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,860
What are you afraid of?

77
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,490
Come on. How old are you?

78
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,360
Dink it up!

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,980
Wait...

80
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,950
No way.

81
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,340
They can't hold their liquor at all.

82
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,230
It's in their genes.

83
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,680
The three brothers are famous for poor capacity.

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,410
Why didn't they say so? Why did they still drink?

85
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,630
That's why they only drink with people they trust.

86
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,250
People they trust.

87
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,000
Yep.

88
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,340
Alright.

89
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,800
You will take care of big brother. I can't do it.

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,750
Let's go.

91
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,810
Get up.

92
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,370
Nah. Nah.

93
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,470
-Actually I...
-Where's your key?

94
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,700
I don't want to treat you as my brother.

95
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,300
Why do you keep touching me?

96
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,590
I...

97
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,520
Don't move! I am trying to find the key!

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,880
Lin Xun, thank god you are not my brother.

99
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,010
You...

100
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,990
You

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,610
What are you doing, Yuan Juncheng?

102
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,790
That was my first kiss!

103
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,110
It's so soft.

104
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,530
It feels so good.

105
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,010
Psycho.

106
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,470
So good.

107
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,400
Wow.

108
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,070
Knock it off.

109
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,000
What did I do to deserve you?

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,540
Nothing good happens after I met you.

111
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,200
My mom passed away on the day I met you.

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,770
I didn't get to see her before she died.

113
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,430
I didn't get to see my mom too.

114
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,110
I will make up to you.

115
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,320
How?

116
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,820
Are you gonna be my mom?

117
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,340
How can I be your mom?

118
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,820
But I can take care of you.

119
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,030
♫

120
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,500
I am not sure I am the one who is being taken care of.

121
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,740
I think I am taking care of you.

122
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,980
Ah...

123
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:30,520
♫

124
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,980
Hey.

125
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,710
♫

126
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,250

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,110

Ah!

132
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,250
What...

133
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,800
Why are you in my bed!

134
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,550
You forgot?

135
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,390
You got drunk lat night.

136
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,630
You pushed me on your bed.

137
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,850
That's impossible.

138
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,240
I tried. But I can't beat you off.

139
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,910
This is not possible.

140
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,010
Wait.

141
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,950
Why aren't you wearing clothes?

142
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,650
I am curious too.

143
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,610
Why did you take off my clothes

144
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,600
when you felt hot in the middle of the night.

145
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,800
Don't lie to me!

146
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,100
It's impossible.

147
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,630
I need to take a shower to calm down.

148
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,420
How could I

149
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,800
let him be in my bed?

150
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,960
I don't think you should drink any more.

151
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,330
You are awful when you are drunk.

152
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,170
Did you poison me?

153
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,980
Why my head is burning?

154
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,990
You drank beer. Of course, you will have a headache.

155
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,030
You can't drink.

156
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,460
Nothing happened between us, night?

157
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,640
I can't beat you any way.

158
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,930
Only I can be the victim.

159
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,720
Did anything happen last night?

160
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,510
Who made the first move?

161
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,660
No.

162
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,280
Yuan Juncheng.

163
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Don't do this.

164
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,680
I treat you as a big brother.

165
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,970
What are you thinking about?

166
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,520
I have something to ask you.

167
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,800
You can just ask.

168
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,910
Why do you need to block me in the corner?

169
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,290
This is confidential.

170
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,540
No one can know.

171
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,080
Not even Junping?

172
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,010
Absolutely no.

173
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,460
What's the secret?

174
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,130
How to find out

175
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,960
if two guys did it or not?

176
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,240
They would know!

177
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,610
No.

178
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,870
No.

179
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,960
I have a friend. He got drunk and forgot what happened.

180
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,120
Stop lying. Brother Juncheng.

181
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,380
Just admit your friend is you.

182
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,840
What did you say?

183
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,810
Nothing.

184
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,020
I am just thinking.

185
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,060
Does your friend's butthole hurt?

186
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,130
No.

187
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,580
That means

188
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,600
nothing happened, right?

189
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,680
It only means your friend didn't get penetrated.

190
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,530
But it's still not clear that

191
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,860
whether the other guy...

192
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,210
In that case,

193
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,410
How to verify it?

194
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,210
Well...

195
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,850
Go ask Yang Xiangshi.

196
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,030
Yang Xiangshi?

197
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,010
Why him?

198
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,130
He said he goes both way.

199
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,970
He can do both boys and girls.

200
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,700
What did you say?

201
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,690
Yang Xiangshi has been living with my Jundao for so long,

202
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,580
now you are telling me he does both?

203
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,040
You really care about your brother's safety.

204
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,340
Where's Yang Xiangshi?

205
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,850
School.

206
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,120
You are having a fever.

207
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,460
Let me cool it down for you.

208
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,990
I have to go the hard way

209
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,070
if you don't help me to get Yuan Junping.

210
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,220
Am I that easy to you?

211
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,710
Auntie!

212
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,020
I will take good care of Lin Xun for you!

213
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,520
♫  In those times, be still ♫

214
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:59,340
♫  My dreams are songs ♫

215
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:07,180
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

216
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,630
♫ It's not the end ♫

217
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,190
♫ We can start again ♫

218
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,870
♫ Let's not give up ♫

219
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:29,660
♫ If I put my all on the line ♫

220
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,920
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

221
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,370
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

222
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:50,010
♫  I will run on this path ♫
