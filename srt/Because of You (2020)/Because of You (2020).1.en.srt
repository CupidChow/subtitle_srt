Take a look.

171
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,990
Hey.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,100
Do you have to write this badly?

173
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,750
That's a style.

174
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,400
As long as the teacher can read it.

175
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,500
Like this.

[Yan Yuerong]

177
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,310
Your handwriting is so beautiful.

178
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,760
I can't do it.

179
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,780
Why can't you?

180
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,830
Look at your big brother. He is half Korean and he has better handwriting than you.

181
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,750
Put some effort in it.

182
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,080
You talk so much.

183
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,650
-How about you write it for me?
-No, you write it yourself.

184
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,960
But even Xiang Shi would write it for my brother.

185
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,830
You write it, or...

186
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
I will erase it for you.

187
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,150
No.

188

Don't erase it, you idiot!

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,050
You are so annoying!

190
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,220
Your handwriting is so ugly.

191
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,090
I have to write it again. So annoying.

192
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Hey, why are you holding the pen that way? No wonder you can't write it well.

193
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,860
How else should I be holding it?

194

Why do you know so much about them?

209
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,210
I didn't want to, but they are the cutest couple.
