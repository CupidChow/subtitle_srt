00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,110
♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,890
♫ I can't face it or avoid it ♫

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,280
♫ I can only stand there and watch him leave ♫

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,060
♫ I can hear the sound of my heart breaking ♫

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,690
♫ Because he made us both fall in love ♫

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,490
♫ I'm willing to give up for the sake of our friendship ♫

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,600
♫ I don't want to see him hurt or suffer any more ♫

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,730
♫ His tears make my heart ache ♫

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,200
♫ Love makes us all fearless ♫

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,360
♫ Being able to protect him is my happiness ♫

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,130
♫ The realm of love only allows for two people ♫

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,960
♫ Please love him well for me ♫

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,200
You should take shower first after we get to my room.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,700
No, your sister will peep at me.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,540
She won't.

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,260
Or we can go to the hot spring here.

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,530
Okay.

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,010
Yo.

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,350
Ah.

20
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,530
Your hot spring is so nice.

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,350
What are you doing? Where did you learn that?

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,100
What the hell was that?

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,290
Don't come over.

24
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,080
Ah!

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,440
Stop.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't mess with me.

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,000
Ah.

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,260
Ah.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,440
Hey.

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,170
Wait.

31
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,760
Stop it.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,590
Ah!

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,480
Great, Yan Yuerong.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,780
That's why you refused to help me.

35
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,000
You are going after him.

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,540
Sister, what are you talking about?

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,580
Quit playing. I watched you grew up.

38
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,590
Don't try to hide it from me.

39
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,910
How dare you to steal my man?

40
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,170
Yan Yuewu,

41
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,570
you can't do this even he is your brother.

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,690
I won't sit and watch if you continue to do this.

43
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,060
Yuan Junping,

44
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,830
I heard that you are a play boy.

45
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,890
And you flirted around.

46
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,710
You are a fuckboy.

47
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,420
Now you are going after my brother?

48
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,430
Fuckboy?

49
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,470
-Who said that?
-Yan Yuerong.

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Did you say that?

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,640
I was just saying.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Junping.

53
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,930
Sis, why did you say random stuff?

54
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,950
I didn't. That's what you told me.

55
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,830
Junping, don't go.

56
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,600
Get off me.

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,790
Why did you say that?

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,530
I didn't mean that.

59
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,750
I didn't.

60
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,790
Playboy?

61
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,460
Flirting around?

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,630
No...

63
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,070
You said I am a fuckboy.

64
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,530
You are not.

65
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,950
Then what else I am?

66
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,840
You the one who means the most to me!

67
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,910
How much?

68
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,620
I can't live without you.

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,410
Don't leave me.

70
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,860
I am sorry.

71
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,940
I am sorry.

72
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,890
I just got better.

73
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,770
You are doing this again.

74
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,930
I can't sleep without hugging you.

75
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,760
I was exhausted to take care of you.

76
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,530
I am the one who is exhausted.

77
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,600
How are you gonna get married like this?

78
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,750
You can come with me.

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,730
Isn't it too much to have three people sleep on one bed?

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,650
Too much? How about you and me?

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,050
Aren't you cold putting your feet here?

82
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,780
No, I am feeling hot now.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,810
Right, why are you so hot?

84
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,830
Are you going to take your clothes off?

85
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,790
I will do it with you.

86
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,380
You are hot. Why are you taking off my clothes?

87
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,710
I feel like doing it.

88
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,670
What?

89
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,510
I wanna know

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,800
will you leave me or stay with me forever?

91
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,010
It's done.

92
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,040
Here.

93
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,600
Thank you.

94
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,080
Here.

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,870
This is your salary for the month.

96
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,520
Didn't you say 10,000 hourly?

97
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,860
Why is it so little?

98
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,580
It is 10,000 hourly.

99
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,020
10,000 won.

100
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,450
I have converted it Taiwan dollar for you.

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,130
I knew you were plotting evil.

102
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,600
Busted.

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,510
You moved in with me

104
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,730
knowing that I was plotting evil.

105
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,340
You were excited, weren't you?

106
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,320
I can move out.

107
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Hey.

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,610
Are you mad?

109
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,610
I am sorry. It was my fault.

110
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,450
Are you apologizing?

111
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,840
Yuan Junping would apologize?

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,550
That's because I like you.

113
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,160
Can you not say this kind of thing out of blue?

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,480
I am not prepared.

115
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,060
I am sorry.

116
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,110
Stop saying you're sorry.

117
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,520
It weirds me out.

118
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,680
My old man and your mom were too stubborn.

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,710
They treated love as a battle.

120
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,040
Which leads to a lifetime regret.

121
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,870
Are you done?

122
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,640
Can you not say this

123
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,110
with no facial expression every time?

124
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,560
I won't be like my father.

125
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,130
What do you mean?

126
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,970
Because I love you

127
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,550
more than I love myself.

128
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,570
Ah!

129
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,840
Which bastard picked such a good timing?

130
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,410
Dumbass Yuan Jundao.

131
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,770
-Hello?
-Hello, brother.

132
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,820
Yo, don't tell me

133
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,180
you're kidnapped.

134
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,030
No.

135
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,390
I am thinking now you are back in Taiwan,

136
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,400
we should have a dinner together.

137
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,250
Got it.

138
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,260
How about we each prepare one meal?

139
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,050
No problem.

140
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,710
Come over to my brother's place this weekend.

141
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,980
Can you help me prepare food?

142
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,060
Nope.

143
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,010
I only promised to cook breakfast for you.

144
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,230
I didn't promise to cook meals for you.

145
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,800
Then what should I do?

146
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,080
However...

147
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,540
If you agree to cook with me,

148
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,540
I might reconsider it.

149
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,950
Umm.

150
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,400
Deal.

151
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,820
Looks so good.

152
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,090
This is the first I cook.

153
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,890
Don't blame me if it's not cooked through.

154
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,610
That's what steaks should be like.

155
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,200
Let me have a bite.

156
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,180
Okay.

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,240
Don't raise your hope.

158
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,420
We can order delivery if it's bad.

159
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,410
Okay?

160
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,790
Hmm.

161
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,920
It's good.

162
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,420
Really?

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,110
Looks like

164
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,350
you cook from now on.

165
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,750
Emmm.

166
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,710
I am holding a knife.

167
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,420
Got it.

168
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,100
We will cook together.

169
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,360
Hmmm.

170
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,840
You cook.

171
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,270
Okay?

172
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Got it.

173
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,870
This cucumber looks good.

174
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,140
Cut me one bite.

175
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,350
It's not washed yet. There's pesticide.

176
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,840
I don't care if you feed me. Come feed me.

177
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,310
Just take the nuts.

178
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,650
It's good!

179
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,870
-Give me one more.
-Go get it yourself.

180
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,630
Let me feed you.

181
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,700
Let me get the door.

182
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,420
-Hello!
-Hey, brother.

183
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,970
Big brother cooked stakes. What about you two?

184
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,580
One second, it's almost ready.

185
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,220
Sure. Take a seat.

186
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,700
Let me make the salad.

187
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,870
Just wipe it.

188
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,950
Hey,

189
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,480
will they find out that we cheated?

190
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,510
It's not really cheating.

191
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,190
We simply asked the backery

192
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,610
to finish half of this.

193
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,930
Alright.

194
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,990
Make it nice.

195
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,710
Don't get too much on it.

196
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,120
You will be busted.

197
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,920
Hey, give me this.

198
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,080
What are you doing?

199
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,190
Let me show you trick.

200
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,030
Wow.

201
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,890
Where did you learn that?

202
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,170
Quit playing and do this.

203
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,450
We are not gonna make it.

204
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,040
This cream tasted so good!

205
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,880
Jesus, give me that.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,020
You should try

207
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,460
this nice cream.

208
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,940
You got it all over my face.

209
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,820
I told you to stop playing.

210
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,890
It's all over your mouth.

211
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,650
Let me eat it up for you.

212
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,720
-No.
-It's okay.

213
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,090
No.

214
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,970
Wow, how rare.

215
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,610
The three brothers are united.

216
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,020
It must be the first time in ten years.

217
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,460
What?

218
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,220
They didn't get along?

219
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,550
That's right.

220
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,070
I grew up living with them. They have never dined together once.

221
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,880
It's because that my mom is the last Mr.Yuan.

222
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,180
She was afraid that big brother will take all the inheritance.

223
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,530
So she didn't allow me to get close to him.

224
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,440
He is not that kind of man.

225
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,650
He cares about us.

226
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,020
Of course.

227
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,690
We have different moms.

228
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,390
But we are brothers.

229
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,240
He's right! A toast to brothers!

230
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,870
Brother, a toast to you.

231
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,560
Alright.

232
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,860
Together!

233
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,950
Cheers!

234
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,210
Try our salad first.

235
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,840
Xiangshi made it so good.

236
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,380
The stakes your big brother are good too.

237
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,610
Check out our cake.

238
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,720
Brother, is it pretty?

239
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Pretty.

240
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,310
Let's eat.

241
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,450
We are closed!

242
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,530
♫  In those times, be still ♫

243
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,140
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

244
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,300
♫  In those times, be still ♫

245
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:43,100
♫  My dreams are songs ♫

246
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:51,000
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,370
♫ It's not the end ♫

248
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,910
♫ We can start again ♫

249
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:06,650
♫ Let's not give up ♫

250
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:13,180
♫ If I put my all on the line ♫

251
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,650
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

252
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:22,990
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

253
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:33,590
♫  I will run on this path that I've chosen ♫
