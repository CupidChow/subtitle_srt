00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,990
♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,640
♫ I can't face it or avoid it ♫

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,170
♫ I can only stand there and watch him leave ♫

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,940
♫ I can hear the sound of my heart breaking ♫

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,590
♫ Because he made us both fall in love ♫

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,210
♫ I'm willing to give up for the sake of our friendship ♫

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,430
♫ I don't want to see him hurt or suffer any more ♫

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,550
♫ His tears make my heart ache ♫

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,180
♫ Love makes us all fearless ♫

10

♫ Being able to protect him is my happiness ♫

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,940
♫ Please love him well for me ♫

13
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,960
My empty home.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,990
It's just me now.

15
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,580
If I say take it, then just take it!

16
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,980
What are you doing here again?

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,500
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,400
It's my house. Why do you care if I turn on the light or not?

19
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,560
Is it your birthday today?

20
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,600
So what?

21
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,240
I saw this when I was out, so I bought it.

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,730
Don't tell me that you are saying

23
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,630
that you kicked my door open to celebrate my birthday.

24
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,640
I rang the doorbell but you didn't answer, so I just came in.

25
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,570
Thanks anyway.

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,100
I thought that since my mother is gone,

27
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,530
I have to spend my birthday alone.

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,250
Make a wish.

29
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,960
The first wish is I wish I can graduate college on time.

30
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,060
The second wish is

31
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,720
that I wish my mother

32
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,920
can be happy in heaven.

33
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,000
Anything else?

34
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,750
I can't say the third one.

35
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,630
The third wish is

36
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,890
is I wish someone can be with me.

37
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,070
Why is this guy with me?

38
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,920
What is this...

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,340
Why does my chest feel this way?

40
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,180
What is going on?

41
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,660
It's been confirmed that I'm not related to this guy.

42
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,170
Here.

43
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,170
What are you- I don't eat sweets.

44
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,860
You don't eat sweet things? Why did you buy such a big cake?

45
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,120
That was the only one left...

46
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,800
What the hell are you doing?

47
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,980
If you are celebrating my birthday for me, why should I eating the cake alone?

48
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,070
If you are really helping me, you need to stick to it.

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,180
Don't you feel that my brother has been weird since he came back?

50
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Really? Yuan Juncheng always looks like that, doesn't he?

51
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,020
What's weird about him?

52
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,980
I just feel like something's wrong.

53
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,030
You are overthinking it. Just play.

54
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,490
Brother.

55
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,350
Hey. Why aren't you picking up your phone?

56
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,020
My phone was on silent, so I didn't hear it.

57
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,750
Junping.

58
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,490
Are you okay with having another older brother?

59
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,750
Why are you asking that?

60
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,510
I thought Lin Shi is proven not related to your family.

61
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,110
Or does he want the family money?

62
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,430
He's not that kind of person.

63
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,010
Why then?

64
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,490
Oh.

65
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,880
If we keep him, we might be able to use him some day.

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,180
Other than being the CEO of Qingyuan, what else can he do?

67
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,560
Also, wouldn't you mind?

68
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,310
It's not that I mind having an extra brother.

69
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,730
Did Lin Xun agree to it?

70
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,810
Not yet.

71
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,080
So now...

72
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Brother,

73
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,260
-are you ok?
-I'm fine.

74
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,030
I ended up having some cake, so my stomach hurts a bit.

75
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,960
Cake?

76
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,230
I thought you can't have cake.

77
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,550
Who was able to feed the big brother any sweets? Did he have a death wish?

78
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,970
It's fine. I'll probably get better soon.

79
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,870
Do you want to lie down? I will get some water for you.

80
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,470
Let's go.

81
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
I remember now.

82
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,290
It was Lin Xun's birthday yesterday.

83
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,920
You didn't know?

84
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,850
Don't you remember how much research I did?

85
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,500
Also, I don't forget the things I read.

86
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,340
So our brother ate the birthday cake for Lin Xun.

87
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,900
Who doesn't know that he doesn't eat sugar in this family?

88
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,440
I heard that your father still want Lin Xun to be his son,

89
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,890
and he wants to train him.

90
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,580
Yeah, also, my brother agreed to it.

91
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,210
That's strange. Isn't he afraid that someone would want to compete with him over the family money?

92
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,090
I'm not worried about that.

93
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,750
I didn't want to be the inheritor in the first place.

94
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,320
I just want to be happy every day, like now.

95
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,160
But every ends eventually.

96
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,040
We can't live like this forever.

97
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,850
Why did you say that?

98
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,590
We are not real brothers.

99
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,740
I will leave some day.

100
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,460
To where? I don't want you to.

101
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,610
If you get married and have kids, am I going to live with you?

102
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,110
Of course. Don't you go anywhere.

103
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,880
What if your other half hates me?

104
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,500
I will divorce and marry another one.

105
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,850
That's so selfish of you.

106
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,240
Hey, did you get a girlfriend behind my back

107
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
and leave me alone?

108
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,140
I'm warning you, you are mind for the rest of your life. Don't try to run away.

109
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,490
Also, you've been incredibly close to Yuewu.

110
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,680
And the perfume smell.

111
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
Let go of me.

112
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,700
I'm not letting go. Tell me.

113
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,290
Tell you what?

114
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,860
Tell me if you are in love with Yuewu.

115
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,850
There's no way I'm in love with her.

116
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,730
Who are you in love with then?

117
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,070
Eh.

118
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,630
I like curry.

119
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,870
Yang Xiangshi, you are avoiding my question!

120
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,610
Spend the night at my house tonight.

121
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,090
I have something for you.

122
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,560
What? Your sister's bikini?

123
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,740
Don't mess around. Don't you remember what it is today?

124
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,830
What?

125
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,370
February 14th.

126
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,630
What day is that?

127
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,860
It's a Valentine's Day gift.

128
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,050
A Valentine's Day gift?

129
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,970
Why are you giving me a Valentine's Day gift?

130
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,320
You will see.

131
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,000
What it is?

132
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,380
It's a stamp.

133
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,480
A stamp!

134
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,490
Didn't you always want one?

135
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,750
So I made one for you.

136
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,840
-Don't tell me you carved it yourself?
-Who else could it be?

137
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,550
Don't sign your name next to my stamp.

138
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,880
Your handwriting is so ugly.

139
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,650
As long as I'm beautiful. What do you care?

140
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,530
Narcissist.

141
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,520
Do you want to try it?

142
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,900
-Do you can an ink pad?
-I'm all prepared.

143
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,530
♫

144
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,150
♫

145
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,780
Where do I stamp it?

146
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,310
♫

147
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,190
♫

148
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,790
They match!

149
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,860
Not bad.

150
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,490
Then I need to stamp more.

151
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,170
Hey!

152
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,900
Who stamps this many times?

153
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,440
It makes me happy.

154
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,600
If you stop me, I'm stamping on your face.

155
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,600
♫

156
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,910
Did I do something wrong?

157
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,680
Why am I being dumped?

158
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,380
You are very nice.

159
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,530
It's just that you shouldn't be befriending strangers on the internet.

160
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,970
And you broke the computer!

161
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,760
Yuan Jundao again?

162
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,370
Hello, Xiao Shi.

163
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,410
When is he going to stop?

164
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,040
Let go of your hands!

165
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,910
I don't want you to answer it.

166
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,270
Unless you teach me how to flirt with guys.

167
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,340
What flirting with guys? I don't know how to.

168
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,370
Stop lying to me. You are so close with Yuan Jundao.

169
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,350
And you manipulate him. Don't tell me that you don't know how to.

170
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm warning you, don't say those things.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,420
So you don't admit it.

172
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,240
So you don't admit it.

173
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,220
Yan Yuewu, are you mad?

174
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,090
If Yuanjun knows what you are doing to me, he would not let you off easy.

175
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,850
I don't want him to let me off.

176
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,630
Xiangshi, are you ok?

177
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,270
Help!

178
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,530
You are drunk!

179
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,880
-Wake up!
-Xiangshi!

180
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,750
Stop it.

181
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,300
Xiangshi!

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,420
Help!

183
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,870
Help!

184
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,060
Yan Yueru, if you do anything to Xiangshi, I will have your whole family to pay for it.

185
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,570
So you're saying that you want to be in a relationship with me, right?

186
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,320
You're like a trapped little mouse.

187
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,690
You can never run away from the palm of my hand.

188
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,930
Sister Yuewu.

189
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,580
I'm always the one backing down when you are angry.

190
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,210
I'm not going to stop myself this time.

191
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,950
-Let go.
-I'm not letting go! You are mine!

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,170
♫  In those times, be still ♫

193
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,900
♫  My dreams are songs ♫

194
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:58,830
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

195
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:04,260
♫ It's not the end ♫

196
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,900
♫ We can start again ♫

197
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,780
♫ Let's not give up ♫

198
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:21,350
♫ If I put my all on the line ♫

199
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,650
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

200
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:30,960
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

201
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:41,720
♫  I will run on this path ♫
♫  that I've chosen ♫
