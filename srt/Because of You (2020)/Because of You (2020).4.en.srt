00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,960
♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,680
♫ I can't face it or fun away ♫

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,050
♫ I can only stand there to watch him leave ♫

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,900
♫ I can hear my heart break ♫

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,440
♫ We are both in love ♫

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,980
♫ But I'm willing to give up because of our friendship ♫

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,520
♫ I don't want to see him sad and suffer ♫

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,500
♫ His tears makes my heart ache ♫

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,970
♫ Love makes us give up everything ♫

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,120
♫ Protecting him makes me happy ♫

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,890
♫ The realm of love only allows for two people ♫

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,850
♫ Please love him well for me ♫

13
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,500
I'm starving.

14
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,100
Luckily I brought a bun back.

15
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,090
Bang.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,410
My dinner!

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,080
Don't eat this.

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,480
If I'm not eating this bun, what else am I gonna eat?

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,200
I'll buy you something good to eat.

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,900
Who wants to eat with you?

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,880
I've been following you all day today.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,750
Do you have nothing to do? Why did you follow me?

23
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,950
I really had nothing to do with the people who wanted to take you away.

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,010
-I know.
-You know?

25
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,630
Then leave. Don't get in my way.

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,060
I told you don't eat this.

27
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,580
What do you want?

28
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,510
Come with me.

29
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,240
Where?

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,220
My home.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,430
Are you crazy?

32
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,170
Why should I go home with you? Who do you think you are?

33
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,820
I am your big brother.

34
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,380
Huh?

35
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,770
You are my long-lost younger brother.

36
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,990
Our father wants me to take you back.

37
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,060
Mister...

38
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,750
what the hell are you talking about? My father died a long time ago.

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,650
Go see a doctor if you need help!

40
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,500
I have no older brother in Taiwan. Neither do I have an older brother in Korea.

41
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,630
Understand?

42
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,130
Come with me.

43
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,180
I don't want to!

44
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,950
Who randomly claims they're related to a stranger?

45
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,100
Are you crazy?

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,330
Do you have a brain?

47
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,860
I guess using words won't work.

48
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,200
What are you doing?!

49
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,230
Get up.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,180
What are you doing!

51
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,690
Fight me!

52
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,740
I don't have money!

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,640
Let go of me!

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,190
Help! There's a mad man here!

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,870
Help!

56
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,250
Be quiet.

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,700
Or I'll seriously kill you.

58
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,730
Okay?

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,790
Be quiet. Okay?

60
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,490
Let go of me!

61
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,540
Help! There's a lunatic! Help!

62
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,160
Help!

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,340
Help me! He tied me up!

64
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,730
Help!

65
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,040
We own this hotel so the soundproofing is top-notch.

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,740
So stop making a fuss and tiring yourself out.

67
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,350
Since no one can hear you anyway.

68
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,820
Okay?

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,250
Why in the world did you tie me up? What do you want?

70
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,540
Become my younger brother.

71
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,570
Do I have any other choices?

72
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,910
Then... You wanna be my father's son?

73
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,550
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,720
What's the difference?

75
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,230
I told you I don't want to.

76
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,950
Being my father's son and being my younger brother are two completely different things.

77
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,750
Do you hear yourself?

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,470
There's no logic in anything you're saying.

79
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,220
You'll understand soon.

80
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,760
What I am going to understand?

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,000
I told you that you got the wrong man.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,380
I am not your father's son. I have my own father.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Is that right?

84
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,900
Then where is your father?

85
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,010
Where is my father?

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
I don't remember.

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,860
But my mom told me he passed away a long time ago.

88
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,280
Do you have proof?

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,210
ID.

90
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,500
ID's can be faked.

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,050
Oh yeah,

92
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,400
my mom told me I look exactly like my father.

93
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,500
-Proof?
-Photos.

94
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,980
Pictures can be photoshopped.

95
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,800
Let me think.

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,290
Don't even think of running.

97
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,840
You wouldn't be able to run far anyway.

98
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,430
Okay?

99
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,480
As they say, "Like father, like son."

100
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
Do you think that between me and you, or your father,

101
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,670
there are any similarities?

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,750
Yes.

103
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,990
You're handsome.

104
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,920
Handsome?

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,720
That's a subjective matter. Anything else?

106
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,330
Nope.

107
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,390
You're nothing like a Yuan at all.

108
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,260
You're too kind.

109
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,240
Is that a compliment or an insult?

110
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,440
I have two other younger brothers besides you.

111
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,250
Your father has enough sons then.

112
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,120
He doesn't even have enough time to spend on you guys,

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,840
he really doesn't need another son.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,940
True, our father never paid any attention to us.

115
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,890
Dang, what a crappy family.

116
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,710
I told you! There's no way I am your younger brother.

117
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,100
Do you need me to translate that into Korean?

118
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,240
In any case,

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,580
whether you are my younger brother or not,

120
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,810
you are the person our father wants.

121
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,940
What makes you so sure of that?

122
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,900
Because I am that person's son.

123
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,260
If you become my younger brother, you'll never have to work again.

124
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,580
You can have wealth that

125
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,140
normal people would never be able to have no matter how hard they work.

126
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,150
Isn't this a good enough deal for you?

127
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,210
No.

128
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,750
If it's truly that great,

129
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,040
why do you look so miserable?

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,580
Aren't you happy?

131
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,600
You're right.

132
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,940
I'm not happy.

133
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,270
In that case, I don't want to be a part of your family.

134
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,630
I don't want to be like you.

135
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,420
That's right.

136
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,540
You're too weak to become a member of the Yuan Family.

137
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,970
If you have the guts, let me go and fight me!

138
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,880
You?

139
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,230
Let go of me!

140
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,870
Someone! Help!

141
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,340
What's that noise?

142
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,600
Older brother already made his move.

143
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,350
What in the world do you want?!

144
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,780
Let go of me!

145
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,720
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet!

146
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,150
Hey!

147
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,380
What are you doing?

148
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,620
Don't do anything rash!

149
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,910
Help!

150
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,310
Older brother! Don't!

151
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,530
Older brother?

152
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,020
Hey. What's gotten into you?

153
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,150
Who told you to hang up the kidnapper's call.

154
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,440
I was still the one that saved you in the end.

155
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,370
But Brother Juncheng, please stop.

156
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,200
Let's talk it out.

157
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,980
Yeah older brother, look how sad he looks. Just let this bastard go.

158
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,310
Hey.

159
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,300
What exactly are you thinking about me?

160
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,400
Did I say anything about what I'm going to do with him?

161
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,200
God dammit.

162
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,320
F***!

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,920
Let go of me if you dare and fight me one-on-one!

164
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,550
No! Calm down!

165
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,530
-Let's talk peacefully!
-I am not gonna talk to you guys peacefully!

166
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,030
It's alright if you don't want to talk.

167
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,520
Since your mom is Chui Ying.
She is the one who President Yuan loves the most.

168
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,080
How do you know my mom's name?

169
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,480
Chui Ying?

170
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,440
Right. Yue Rong has looked into it.

171
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,550
Your mom and my dad actually grew up together.

172
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,430
They were supposed to get married.

173
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,990
For some reason, they didn't in the end.

174
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,640
Wait.

175
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,030
Who is this President Yuan

176
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,960
you have been talking about?

177
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,210
Yuan Weizhi, the owner of Yuan Financial Banking.

178
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,710
He is our dad.

179
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,090
He might be your dad now, too.

180
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,040
So after all this ruckus,

181
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,020
the father you've been mentioning this whole time, is Yuan Weizhi?

182
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,910
You know President Yuan?

183
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,100
Nope.

184
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,240
But I just gave him a call.

185
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,900
His number is in my pocket.

186
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,800
Wallet.

187
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,410
[Yuan Weizhi]

188
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,230
It looks like he really is President Yuan's illegitimate son.

189
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,060
How is that possible?

190
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,120
- It was just a phone call.
- How is it not possible?

191
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,530
Not even the president of Taiwan has this phone number.

192
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,900
What the hell?

193
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,500
You said you called him?

194
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,550
Yeah, I did.

195
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,030
My mother told me to call him.

196
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,850
What did you talk about?

197
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,390
She wanted me to tell him that,

198
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,860
"It was you who lost in the end."

199
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,620
- No way.
- No.

200
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,490
The more I think about it the more it makes sense.

201
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,240
Chui Ying was definitely President Yuan's most loved.

202
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,450
Only love can make a man lose like that.

203
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,650
The first rule of the Yuan Family is to cut love out of our lives.

204
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,050
There's no way that old man ever loved anyone.

205
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,960
I heard from our butlers that they grew up together.

206
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,280
They even lived together.

207
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,360
Their relationship...

208
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,930
was definitely was more than just friends.

209
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,450
Even if all of that is true, just how much more than friendship can it be?

210
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,060
My mom and your dad,

211
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,010
at most,

212
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,200
were each other's exes.

213
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,900
No way! My dad has tons of ex-girlfriends.

214
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,680
But think about it, he only cares about your mom.

215
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,140
But my mom got married in the end. So that's impossible.

216
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,840
There's no way I am this Korean's little brother.

217
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,910
Unless you guys can prove it.

218
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,810
Proof?

219
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,280
I have proof. It's in my laptop.

220
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,970
Come on, I'll go with you to get it.

221
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,850
Why do you keep turning me down?

222
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,140
Do you hate the idea of becoming my brother that much?

223
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,940
I do.

224
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,910
Why?

225
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,590
'Cause I don't want to use honorifics on you.

226
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:40,570
No one but my superiors or people I like can speak casually to me.

227
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,360
But I'm younger than you.

228
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,620
Then there's only one solution.

229
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,740
You'll just have to make me like you.

230
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,860
You mom had you before she got married.

231
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,470
Judging by his birthday, he is our son.

232
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,140
Look's like this is what it's going to have to be.

233
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
These are Lin Xun's DNA test results.

234
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,910
Please confirm them yourself directly, father.

235
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,250
♫  In those times, be still ♫

236
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,960
♫  My dreams are songs ♫

237
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:50,900
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

238
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,330
♫ It's not the end ♫

239
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,870
♫ We can start again ♫

240
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,720
♫ Let's not give up ♫

241
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,260
♫ If I put my all on the line ♫

242
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,650
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

243
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:23,080
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

244
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,690
♫  I will run on this path ♫

245
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,380
♫  that I've chosen ♫
