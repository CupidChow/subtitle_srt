♫ I can't face it or avoid it ♫

Lin Xun.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,890
Mommy,

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,800
What's up?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,100
Let me tell you,

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,900
if I am gone one day,

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
call this person for me.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
Why are you suddenly saying this?

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,920
I know my own body.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Why don't you call him yourself?

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,700
Because we made a bet.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,900
A bet?

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,500
I shouldn't have saved that Korean person that day.

25
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,860
I couldn't see my mom for the last time.

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,600
Now in this world,

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,850
It's just me that's left.

28
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,910
Who is this person exactly?

29
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,000
[Unknown caller]

30
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,930
Hello?

31
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,820
Excuse me, is this Mr. Yuan Weizhi?

32
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,250
Who are you?

33
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,960
How do you have this number?

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Someone asked me to call you.

35
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,550
Who?

36
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,180
Is it Chui Ying?

37
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,100
Where is she?

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,490
She told me to tell you,

39
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,680
Yuan Weizhi,

40
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,560
In the end...

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,330
It's you who lost...

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,490
That's impossible.

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,840
Put her on the phone immediately.

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,940
I can pay you however much money you want.

45
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,990
Why would I want your money?

46
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,480
Who exactly are you then?

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,520
Let me talk to Chui Ying on the phone right now.

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,040
She's already gone.

49
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,100
Chui Ying!

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,830
You will regret it for the rest of your life if you leave me!

51
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,550
Then let's seriously make a bet, Yuan Weizhi.

52
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,700
-You...
-I bet I will...

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,340
never see you for the rest of my life.

54
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,500
Until you die

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,030
or the day I die.

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,550
What do you mean by "She's already gone"?

57
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,630
Who is she to you? Answer me now!

58
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,340
Who I am to my mom is none of your damn business!

59
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,700
Watch your attitude!

60
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,350
Chui Ying has a son?

61
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,430
Chui Ying has a son?

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,500
Chui Ying is gone.

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
Chui Ying died!

64
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,600
President, what happened? Are you alright?

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm fine.

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,660
Right,

67
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,740
has Juncheng come back from Korea?

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,490
He was mildly injured so he will come by in a few days.

69
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,110
Call him

70
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,090
and Jundao and Junping,

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,900
immediately tell them to come to see me tomorrow morning.

72
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,320
Yes.

73
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,540
Yes.

74
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,660
The President wants to see you. Are you available?

75
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,420
Yes, got it.

76
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,840
-It's your dad.
-My dad?

77
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,230
Yep.

78
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,970
What does he want?

79
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,520
Ah, Junping's here.

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,570
Yuan Juncheng. What are you doing here?

81
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,290
Since when did I need to report my schedule to you?

82
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,260
Also, when you see your senior shouldn't you respectfully say hello using honorifics?

83
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,620
"Older brother."

84
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,530
Try saying it once.

85
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,590
What right do you have to call yourself an "older brother?"

86
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,150
Do you still remember the time I got kidnapped?

87
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,090
The criminals called you to ask for ransom money,

88
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,200
and you hung up the phone on them! Why did you do that?

89
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,720
Before you go blaming someone else, think about why you were kidnapped in the first place,

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,900
and stop being annoying about it.

91
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,130
This is your way of being an older brother?

92
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,220
You have the audacity to tell me to use honorifics on you!

93
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,610
Stop it, Junping. Older brother's way of caring is different from other people.

94
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,520
He just wants you to watch out for your safety.

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,270
Be careful? This is how he cares about me?

96
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,480
- He only criticizes me!
- Hey

97
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,810
Yes, that's exactly what I'm going for.

98
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,940
Yuan Juncheng, don't think I'm still young and can't win a fight against you.

99
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,040
I don't want to fight fools.

100
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,540
Exactly how many times do I need to tell you to call me "older brother"?

101
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,120
Even a three-year-old is better than you.

102
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,520
You want me to call you "older brother"? Fine.

103
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,560
But apologize to me about the kidnapping incident!

104
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,650
Apologize!

105
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,850
Stop arguing.

106
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,920
Do you guys know why dad suddenly called us here?

107
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,650
Maybe he's sick and wants to divide his assets.

108
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,660
It doesn't sound like it's going to be good news.

109
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,310
What happened?

110
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,300
From the looks on your faces, seems like you guys just fought.

111
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,050
- Not at all.
- Sit

112
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,100
Dad, why did you gather us?

113
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,790
Do fathers need reasons to their sons?

114
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,460
You are not a regular father. You surely have a reason.

115
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,150
Alright.

116
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,410
Let's talk about you guys first.

117
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,870
-Yuandao, how's your mom been recently?
-Pretty good.

118
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,550
She uses your alimony everyday to travel.

119
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,590
She is now in Bali on vacation.

120
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,480
She also got herself a Thai boyfriend.

121
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,280
Very good.

122
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,120
It's good to hear she is taking care of herself.

123
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,330
Junping,

124
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,640
How about your mom?

125
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,220
My mom? Pretty much the same.

126
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,840
She will never divorce you

127
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,970
until I get my third of the inheritance.

128
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,670
No matter how many girlfriends you have out there,

129
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,990
she will always guard the position of Mrs. Yun.

130
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,940
Very good. Strong will she has.

131
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,740
What about you, Juncheng?

132
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,480
My mother died because of you, so you should have no reason to ask.

133
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,950
President,

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,100
Did you call us for family reasons, or because of the company?

135
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,180
It's both a business and a private matter.

136
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,610
- I have a son out there.
- Oh. No, no.

137
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,370
-You have three sons here.
-Let me finish.

138
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,430
I...

139
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,460
have another son out there. He is your brother.

140
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,330
You have a son with another woman?

141
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,030
Does my mom know?

142
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,220
Relax, he is older than you.

143
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,600
It happened before your mom.

144
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,340
-Does my mom know?
-Does my mom know?

145
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,780
That's our generation's business! You children don't need to worry about it.

146
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,910
Don't worry about it?

147
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,240
My mother wouldn't have died so early if it wasn't for you.

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,960
Did you divorce my mom for him?

149
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,250
I have mistreated your moms.

150
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,350
But towards you sons I have not lacked a single bit in providing you anything!

151
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,980
Anything.

152
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,140
You provided us no lack of money. But what about your affection?

153
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,110
You provide your sons with anything just to train us to run your business one day!

154
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,610
Are you qualified to run it then?

155
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,150
Alright.

156
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,220
I am giving you a chance right now.

157
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,280
Whoever can find your long lost brother first,

158
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,420
I will grant them one promise with no conditions.

159
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,130
What can you promise?

160
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,880
A promise from me, Yuan Weizhi, can get you anything in the world.

161
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,310
Including...

162
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,690
the position of Yuan Banking's future CEO. Is that good enough?

163
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,040
Father,

164
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,600
Are you really suggesting that

165
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,100
this one kid is more important than us three- no, the entire Yuan Family?

166
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,670
Don't you all overthink it. I just want to make it up to him.

167
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,630
Anyway, just find him!

168
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,000
Why don't you ask your staff to do it?

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,290
This child doesn't know our family's style. I don't want to scare him off.

170
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,410
Anyhow, I want you three brothers to do it first.

171
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,450
Bring him back to me after building his trust in you.

172
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,510
Trust?

173
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,440
We don't even trust each other.

174
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,710
Not to mention he randomly shows up to take a part of our inheritance.
Are you kidding me?!

175
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,220
I don't care about the Yuan inheritance. I only-

176
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,280
want to take back what belongs to my mom.

177
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,930
And then, I will sever my ties with the Yuan Family.

178
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,370
Let me be honest with you,

179
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,380
the only reason your grandfather can keep his hot spring resort in Busan

180
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,860
is because every year,

181
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,270
I anonymously invest 30 million USD on his run down resort.

182
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,760
Otherwise that old place would've been gone ages ago.

183
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,360
This is ridiculous.

184
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,060
Is that true?

185
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,120
Believe whatever you want.

186
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,940
This is his information.

187
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,600
Bring him back for me!

188
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,120
Lin Xun?

189
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,250
This guy...

190
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,200
[Preview]

191
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Maybe Lin Xun's mom has never wanted Mr.Yuan to know of his existence.

192
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,070
We might need to sneak to his house to find out.

193
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,960
You must stay tonight.

194
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,310
So I can thank you.

195
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,130
Why isn't he picking up? Is he kidnapped?

196
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,660
♫  In those times, be still ♫

197
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,400
♫  My dreams are songs ♫

198
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:52,400
♫  At this point, I cannot give up ♫

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,850
♫ It's not the end ♫

200
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,440
♫ We can start again ♫

201
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,200
♫ Let's not give up ♫

202
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,880
♫ If I put my all on the line ♫

203
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,170
♫ I'll have no regrets ♫

204
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:24,360
♫  I will tell my story again ♫

205
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,960
♫  I will run on this path ♫

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,950
♫  that I've chosen ♫
