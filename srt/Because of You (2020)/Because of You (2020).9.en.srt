00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,160
♫ There's a mood I can't describe  ♫

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,840
♫ I can't face it or avoid it ♫

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,240
♫ I can only stand there and watch him leave ♫

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,110
♫ I can hear the sound of my heart breaking ♫

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,610
♫ Because he made us both fall in love ♫

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,420
♫ I'm willing to give up for the sake of our friendship

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,610
♫ I don't want to see him hurt or suffer any more ♫

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,700
♫ His tears make my heart ache ♫

9

♫ Love makes us all fearless ♫

♫ Being able to protect him is my happiness ♫

00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,640
♫ Please love him well for me ♫

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,370
Brother Juncheng, you asked to see me?

14
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,530
Umm.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,470
Yang Xiangshi.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,870
Be honest with me.

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,210
You sleep with Jundao every day.

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,700
Did you do anything to him?

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,660
What could I have done to him?

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,560
I am bi but I am not for anyone.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,000
Are you saying that

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,050
Jundao is not good enough for you?

23
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,990
Wait,

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,000
do you or do you not expect me to do something?

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,260
How do I know

26
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,040
if you did anything when he was drunk?

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,720
There's no way to keep it secret, okay?

28
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,970
Really?

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,250
Do you have zero experience at all?

30
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,860
Hey!

31
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,700
None of your business.

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,900
Let me tell you,

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,810
it doesn't matter if you're a girl or boy,

34
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,620
there's no way you couldn't know about it.

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,760
Especially for boys.

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,810
So I am sure that I didn't do anything to him.

37
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,900
I am the one that needs to be worried.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,830
Understand?

39
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,890
Understood.

40
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,790
Yang Xiangshi.

41
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,800
You can leave now.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,280
Hurry up and leave!

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,330
What...

44
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,890
Leave.

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,020
Father.

46
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,620
Did you take care of everything?

47
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,200
No.

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,250
I am sorry.

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,890
Lin Xun didn't want to be adopted.

50
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,090
How is that possible?

51
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,020
You were always accountable.

52
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,910
I even told him that

53
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,840
I am willing to share the inheritance with him.

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
What did he say?

55
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,780
Lin Xun said his mom did lose,

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,370
so wouldn't he.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
That kid

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
is as stubborn

59
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,500
as his mom.

60
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,780
I was surprised.

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,700
I've never seen anyone like this.

62
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,990
Indeed.

63
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,340
Cui Ying was a woman with backbones.

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,040
I lost completely.

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,150
Father,

66
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,090
sometimes it's not bad to admit that.

67
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,040
It's too late

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,900
for me to realize that.

69
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,130
Cui Ying has died.

70
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,270
All I want now

71
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,250
is to take care of her kid.

72
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,800
You don't have to.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,030
I will take care of him.

74
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,350
You?

75
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,500
Yes.

76
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,210
I learned that from you.

77
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,270
You can't be too stubborn.

78
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,990
Otherwise,

79
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,470
you will lose at the end.

80
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,990
Mom,

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,790
you have won.

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,200
Goodbye.

83
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,300
What did you do this?

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,970
You won't be able to see her again.

85
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,600
It comes and goes.

86
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,440
I only need to come by the sea

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,740
if I miss her.

88
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,660
All the sea is connected.

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,480
Isn't it?

90
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,870
Everyone of Yuan's family is a control freak.

91
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,030
We never let go.

92
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,790
In the end my father had nothing.

93
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,430
I wonder if they have ever regretted it.

94
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,780
They must have.

95
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,670
They were in love.

96
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,810
But they tortured each other.

97
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,830
And they were all deeply hurt.

98
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,450
Indeed.

99
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,260
But I am glad that they didn't end up well.

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Because of your mom?

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,300
No.

102
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,010
Because of you.

103
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,160
I am glad that you are not my brother.

104
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,860
So you don't want me to be your brother anymore.

105
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,260
Nope.

106
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,340
Great.

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,570
Let's go home.

108
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,630
Umm.

109
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,260
Let's?

110
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,220
Why is it us? And whose home are we going back to?

111
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,210
My home.

112
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,400
Why is it your home?

113
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,030
From now on, my home is your home.

114
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,880
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
Do you have any misunderstanding?

116
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,310
Nothing happened between us

117
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,380
that night.

118
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,140
I know.

119
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,970
I have come through that

120
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,710
no matter what happened that night,

121
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,460
I will be responsible for you.

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,490
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,950
I am telling you how I feel.

124
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,890
Can't you see?

125
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,490
Yuan Juncheng,

126
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,170
my mom is here.

127
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,580
Not a problem.

128
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,280
I can use this chance to tell her that

129
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,980
I will take care of you.

130
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,300
Auntie,

131
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,600
from now on,

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,150
I will take care of Lin Xun!

133
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,250
Yuan Juncheng, what's your problem?

134
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,880
Who would pick such a timing?

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,600
You,

136
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,240
are my problem.

137
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,440
We

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,380
can't be apart from now on.

139
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,360
♫ It's taking us back ♫

140
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,720
♫ This is our last memory  ♫

141
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,550
♫ I don't want to miss it  ♫

142
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,430
♫ I want to be with you  ♫

143
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,180
♫ Sit here untile the sun rises ♫

144
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:34,700
♫ I want to see the stars with you  ♫

145
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,670
♫ I want to walk on the galaxy with you  ♫

146
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:47,280
♫ As long as I am with you ♫

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,680
♫ As long as I am with you ♫

148
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,730
Xiangshi.

149
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
Xiangshi.

150
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,700
Why do you sleep all the way over here?

151
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,140
Hey.

152
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,520
Strange. It's so hot.

153
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,810
You are having a fever.

154
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,210
Don't get close to me. You will get it.

155
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,380
No. I need to get the ice bag.

156
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,340
Xiangshi.

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,120
Let me ice patch you.

158
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,060
How is it? Do you feel better now?

159
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,260
No.

160
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,740
I still feel awful.

161
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,040
Awful?

162
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,450
Is this not cold enough?

163
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,640
Jundao,

164
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,370
stop torturing me.

165
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,280
Is this not cold enough?

166
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,060
You will be helping me a lot if you leave.

167
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,840
Jundao,

168
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,120
what are you doing?

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,360
I am using my hand to ice patch you.

170
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,690
So it won't be wet.

171
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,580
Stop fooling around.

172
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,740
I am not fooling around. I just want you to get better.

173
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,100
Do you feel better now?

174
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,930
Yes.

175
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,320
Come one, stop taking and sleep.

176
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,910
I feel much better.

177
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,440
My fever is gone.

178
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,410
Thank you.

179
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,130
Yan Yuerong.

180
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,780
If you don't help me go after Yan Junping,

181
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,960
I will have to do it in a tough way.

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,030
Sister, stop messing around.

183
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,750
I am not.

184
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,810
Yuan Jundao stole my hunk.

185
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,010
I shall go after his brother.

186
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Sister,

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,490
I am telling you,

188
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,430
Yuan Junping is a playboy.

189
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,090
He flirts around.

190
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,340
The point is he doesn't like women.

191
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,080
He will talk trash behind your back.

192
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,500
He is mean and doesn't care how you feel.

193
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,700
No, no, no.

194
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,300
I don't care.

195
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,640
I might be able to hold him.

196
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,220
Sister, he is not suitable for you.

197
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,130
Think about it.

198
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,270
Junping.

199
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,040
What?

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,640
What do you think of my sister?

201
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,730
What do you mean?

202
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,260
Is possible for you guys

203
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,940
to date?

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,520
Yan Yuerong.

205
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,300
I treated you as my best friend.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,500
Now you are matching me up with your sister.

207
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,400
What do you mean?

208
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,780
No.

209
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,260
I am just asking. Don't be mad.

210
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,600
Yuewu is your sister.

211
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,110
I treat her as my sister too.

212
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Do you think what you said is possible?

213
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,900
Am I someone you can do whatever you want to?

214
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,330
No, you are not.

215
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,530
So you think you can do whatever you want.

216
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,870
I don't.

217
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,430
You want to do whatever you want?

218
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,320
Let me tell you,

219
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,140
this is doing whatever I want.

220
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,480
Is this doing whatever you want or not?

221
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,270
What do you think?

222
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,580
What does this look like?

223
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,620
Junping,

224
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,630
you are the one who means the most to me!

225
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,180
You don't have to .

226
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,870
I will take care of him.

227
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,600
I knew you were up to something.

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,580
I am sorry.

229
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,080
It was my fault.

230
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,740
The three brothers are united.

231
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,400
Cheers!

232
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,580
