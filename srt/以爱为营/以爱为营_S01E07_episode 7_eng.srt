00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,900
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,525
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

4
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,775
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,588
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

7
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,325
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

8
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,499
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

9
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:53,950
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

11
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

13
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,503
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

14
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:09,574
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

15
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:12,945
â™«  Oh, you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

16
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,250
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

19
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:35,925
   

20
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,911
   

21
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,160
   

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,073
It's so late.

23
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,120
If we don't pass, just tell us.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,939
What are we waiting for here?

25
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,520
I'm sorry. We're journalists and we need to follow strict rules.

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,200
The rule says 12:00.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,640
We will wait until midnight.

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,180
The chief editor is waiting here.

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,420
What are you complaining about?

30
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,520
Did you get in touch with him?

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
He said he would reply to me today.

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,092
I trust him.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,159
 Mr. Shi, everyone at the magazine is waiting here for your reply. 

34
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,440
 It's not about you or me. 

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,839
 It takes a lot of effort to get an issue out of a magazine. 

36
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:45,139
 Workers at the printing house are working overtime and waiting for us. 

37
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,780
 It's fine if you don't approve the manuscript. 

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,300
 Please give me a clear reply. 

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,159
 We will publish my colleague's manuscript. 

40
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,639
 Please reply to me. 

41
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,199
 I will go to your house and thank you. 

42
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,800
 I would like to ask Mr. Shi again. Please reply to me as soon as possible. 

43
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,114
   
   

44
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:34,199
Cheer up, everybody.

45
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:39,026
Shi Yan approved the manuscript.

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,740
Thank you for your effort.

47
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,319
Persevere and complete the follow-up tasks.

48
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,260
 - Great. 
 - Congratulations, Ms. Shuyi. 

49
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,207
 - Congratulations, Ms. Shuyi. 
 - Congratulations, Ms. Shuyi. 

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,977
- I am leaving. 
 - Bye-bye.

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,039
 Thank you, Mr. Chen. 

52
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,860
 Thank you for your effort. 

53
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,840
 No problem. 

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,200
 My boss is working overtime. 

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
 I donâ€™t work as hard as him. 

56
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,640
 Thank you, Mr. Shi. 

57
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,779
 Thank you for your effort. 

58
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,399
There was an unsubscription yesterday.

59
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,079
Why is there no movement at all today?

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,140
Does he like cheesy love words?

61
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,080
 They say that a man remains a boy all his life. Men are not straightforward animals..  

62
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,900
 There's nothing wrong with women. 

63
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,120
 Haven't you read those CEO romances? 

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,887
 The more a man loves you, the less likely he's going to admit it. 

65
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,080
 The more he likes you, the more he behaves like a bully. 

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,120
 That's Shi Yan for you. 

67
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:42,360
 A literary's cloudy day, a swallow's rainy day, and a young hero's sunny day. 

68
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,380
 Not as good as you chatting with me. 

69
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,260
 Today, I want to chase you as always. 

70
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,040
 Today, you are ignoring me. 

71
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
 Tomorrow, I will look for you. 

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,520
 If you fall for this trick, I am sorry. 

73
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,399
 I did it on purpose. 

74
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,299
 Same place tonight. 

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,059
 I am busy today. Maybe some other time. 

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,879
She hasn't come yet.

77
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,580
How can I follow this Situ Yi? She's the same as she was in college, always being late.

78
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,720
She is half an hour late.

79
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,540
She's a famous beauty blogger.

80
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,839
It's fair for her to be a diva.

81
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,979
Are bloggers so busy?

82
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,040
They should be. Because they earn a lot.

83
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,379
That's why you want to update the e-newsletter.

84
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,600
I am sorry. I had to post a vlog.

85
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,879
I just watched them finish editing.

86
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,719
Order whatever you want. It's my treat.

87
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,740
You are late. If you don't pay, who will?

88
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,279
Let's order.

89
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,940
Long time, Situ Yi.

90
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,360
You're getting more beautiful.

91
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,540
You are beautiful, too. You are as beautiful as before.

92
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,179
Well, are you still working at Financial Introduce?

93
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:23,160
It's been three years since we graduated.

94
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,480
You must be a deputy editor or a chief editor.

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,560
No, I'm still the same, still a feature journalist.

96
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Print newspapers are dead. Why don't you change careers?

97
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,500
I thought you must have reached the management level,

98
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,560
that's why you were reluctant to leave.

99
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Listen to my advice and quickly focus on new media.

100
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,320
We've been publishing e-newsletter.

101
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm thinking about how to upgrade it to attract more subscribers.

102
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,320
A form or medium may decline, but nice content won't.

103
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,040
A form or medium may decline, but nice content won't.

104
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,520
Just like your daily vlog, video will be replaced by a newer medium.

105
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,580
As long as your content is excellent and keeps up with the times,

106
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,000
it will not be replaced.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,839
She's right.

108
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,020
These are the technical problems and dilemmas that we are facing,

109
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,210
and how we will solve these problems in the future.

110
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,880
I hope you can give us some technical support and guidance.

111
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,820
You are doing great.

112
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,120
I suggest you reevaluate the time you need to solve problems.

113
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,419
Set up a team to tackle critical problems.

114
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,640
Other technical departments continue to explore other areas.

115
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,120
Actually, I am willing to give you some advice during this process.

116
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,399
But I can't join Le'an.

117
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,660
Because your team building can't match

118
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,039
my requirements for technology development.

119
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,720
Sorry to interrupt you.

120
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,460
I hope you will consider joining Le'an.

121
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,000
Yu You told me that you love challenges.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,320
As you just said,

123
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,480
a breakthrough in this technology is only a matter of time.

124
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,020
No offense,

125
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,000
but sooner or later other teams will break through this technology.

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,819
So I donâ€™t think this thing can exactly be called a challenge.

127
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:24,660
But all this is very difficult for Le'an Technology.

128
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,720
As you just said, "Impossible."

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,820
So a new team being built in China to achieve a breakthrough in this technology in an impossible time

130
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,470
is the real challenge.

131
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,020
After solving the problem,

132
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,020
you should get this technology into mass production as soon as possible

133
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,640
and put it into use.

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,540
These challenges are not easy for any one person or team to solve.

135
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,740
I personally think it's interesting and challenging.

136
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,279
You won't experience these in schools and labs abroad.

137
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,519
But I can't do it all on my own.

138
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,039
I will provide you with financial support.

139
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,220
And I will help Chen Kang build a team

140
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,579
that's the best in the country, maybe the world.

141
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:19,200
Next, it depends on whether you are willing or not.

142
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,140
Mr. Shi, your speech excites me.

143
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,620
But it's not an easy decision.

144
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,879
I need some time to think.

145
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,160
Bruce, Shi Yan is an incredible partner.

146
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,099
Working with him, you will get a different kind of fun.

147
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:43,020
And he's good at rock climbing.

148
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,159
You can challenge him.

149
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,000
This is not an easy decision.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,899
I will give you some time.

151
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,819
I want to tell you that no matter what you decide,

152
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:57,399
I will never give up on my goal.

153
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,080
Shuyi, are you still dating Yue Xingzhou?

154
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,178
We broke up.

155
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:06,659
Really?

156
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,679
Everyone in the group chat knows it.

157
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't pretend to be surprised.

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,559
Now that you've broken up, I will tell you something.

159
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,960
What?

160
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,800
When we were in college, Yue Xingzhou chased you for a long time.

161
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,680
Actually, he was flirting with me.

162
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,940
I don't think you knew about it.

163
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,399
What?

164
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,400
We were just flirting.

165
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,759
I was just a backup.

166
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,280
If he couldn't date you, he came to me.

167
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,000
I was silly. I thought he was handsome and affectionate.

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,219
I thought I could impress him and marry him.

169
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:43,320
Scum.

170
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,759
Forget it. It's over.

171
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,800
Situ Yi didn't tell you about it before, but she tells you now.

172
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,240
She's mean.

173
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,639
Yue Xingzhou is the worst.

174
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,880
What Situ Yi said was right.

175
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,499
About what?

176
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:03,919
I can't delay the e-newsletter upgrade.

177
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,820
I must finish it soon.

178
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,220
I am talking about Yue Xingzhou, but you are thinking about the e-newsletter.

179
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,640
Can you have some of the love, hate, seven emotions, and six desires of a normal woman?

180
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,360
You are so boring. How could you take Shi Yan?

181
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,600
If you can't handle him, you can't upgrade the e-newsletter.

182
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,920
When handling Shi Yan, leave yourself some room. Okay?

183
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
I will upgrade the e-newsletter.

184
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,240
And I will handle Shi Yan.

185
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,979
Okay. Good luck.

186
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,400
Okay. See you in half an hour.

187
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,740
Old Fan, I'm not going back to the office. Drive me to the Jingxiao Building.

188
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,719
Got it, Mr. Shi.

189
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,900
 Pick me up. I miss you. 

190
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,380
God, are you crazy?

191
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,420
You are so blunt.

192
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,540
It's fine. He won't read it.

193
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,039
Why are youâ€¦

194
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,820
I was passing by.

195
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,160
What a coincidence.

196
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,060
Otherwise?

197
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,320
That's true.

198
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:11,220
Where is Mr. Chen? Why isn't he around?

199
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,200
Is he busy?

200
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,060
You have a press conference at the end of the year. And you are working with the Guan Capital.

201
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,460
You should be busy.

202
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,619
Do you want to talk to him?

203
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,120
No. I am just asking.

204
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,300
I will text him.

205
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,720
Please pull over and drop me off. Thank you.

206
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,070
Okay, will do.

207
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,909
Why did you get off?

208
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,820
I was following you.

209
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:08,470
I got off to leave you two alone.

210
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,720
He's driving home.

211
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,340
It's a good chance for you to do something with him.

212
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,460
Didn't you see his face?

213
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,460
I don't know what I said wrong. He gets angry easily.

214
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,300
You asked Shi Yan to pick you up, but you asked about another guy.

215
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,080
No one is going to be happy about that.

216
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,280
He was jealous.

217
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,500
Your actions are simply a textbook-level example of embarrassing flirtation.

218
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,820
Zheng Shuyi, you're a journalist.

219
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,100
You should know something about the art of language.

220
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,460
If you can handle Shi Yan like this,

221
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,159
I'm willing to be single forever.

222
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,772
He is jealous?

223
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,361
Shi Yan was jealous of Chen Sheng?

224
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,600
No way.

225
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,300
 Mr. Shi. 

226
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,371
What's going on?

227
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,979
 I wonder if you'll come back for dinner. 

228
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:01,600
No. Aren't you supposed to be busy?

229
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,520
I am supposed to be busy?

230
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,759
What did he mean?

231
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,271
 Mr. Shi, thank you for the ride. 

232
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,759
 I'll take you out to dinner sometime as a thank you. 

233
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,080
 Mr. Shi, tell me. What kind of fate allowed us to meet there today? 

234
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,179
 Mr. Shi, tell me. What kind of fate allowed us to meet there today? 

235
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,860
   

236
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,520
 This person must have some evil intentions. 

237
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,479
 He never replies to normal messages. 

238
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,900
 Mr. Shi, were you jealous? 

239
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,600
 Are you free? 

240
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,960
 I am free. 

241
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,759
What does he mean?

242
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,180
Since you don't know, don't reply to him.

243
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,500
Ignore him for a few days.

244
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,580
 Same place tonight. 

245
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,419
I have something to do. I got to go.

246
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,279
I told you not to reply to him.

247
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,400
Ignore him for a few days.

248
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,779
What's wrong?

249
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:44,192
   

250
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,100
This is a good one.

251
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,599
This garbled message is a stroke of genius.

252
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,780
Don't explain. Leave him figure it out.

253
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,680
I promise you he won't be able to sleep

254
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,940
thinking about the meaning of the message.

255
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,980
- Are you sure? 
 - Of course.

256
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,840
Don't reply to him.

257
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,240
To conquer a man,

258
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,880
you have to make him curious.

259
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Once you arouse his curiosity, he will become interested in you.

260
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:17,290
Don't reply to him.

261
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:39,674
   
   

262
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,800
If Shi Yan finds out I brought you here, he'll kill me.

263
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,100
Why are you so wordy?

264
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,679
I am 22.

265
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,020
I am old enough to go to a bar.

266
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,139
And I've been to bars when I was abroad.

267
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,140
Just drink. I will send you back when you are done.

268
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,780
  
 What does this mean? 

269
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,719
Say his name and he appears.

270
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,139
What does my uncle mean?

271
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:00,998
I don't know.

272
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,150
Maybe he sent the wrong message.

273
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,160
My uncle has been weird recently.

274
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
He was already a weirdo.

275
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,160
Okay.

276
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,239
How dare you say that about my uncle.

277
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,379
I will tell him now.

278
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,960
What?

279
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,340
I was kidding.

280
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,379
You're afraid of him, too.

281
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
Cheers.

282
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,900
Beauty, are you alone?

283
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,400
It's boring to drink alone.

284
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Let's drink together.

285
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,400
No, thank you.

286
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
You don't need it today.

287
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,400
Maybe you will need it tomorrow.

288
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,800
Give me your contact information. So we can drink together another time.

289
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
That's not necessary.

290
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,700
Don't be shy.

291
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,200
Why don't you leave your phone number so we can go out and play?

292
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,500
Come on.

293
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,200
I will scan your QR code.

294
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,500
No need. My boyfriend is coming back.

295
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,000
It would be pointless to say this perfunctorily, right?

296
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Where do you want to go?

297
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,400
What are you doing?

298
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,000
13318900476.

299
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,600
Don't you want contact information? Write it down.

300
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,300
She is young. And she is shy.

301
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,200
This is my phone number.

302
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
You can contact me.

303
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Okay.

304
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,400
Miss, thank you.

305
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
You gave him your phone number.

306
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,400
What if he harasses you?

307
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
Brilliant.

308
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,800
It's fine for a girl to go to a bar.

309
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,900
But you must first learn to recognize others and protect yourself.

310
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I learned a lesson.

311
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
 I think you are being really weird. 

312
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,700
 Is there something wrong with you? 

313
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,200
 I can drink more. 

314
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Where are you?

315
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,800
- Come on, have another case. 
 - I have to go.

316
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,000
- Talk to you later. 
 - Drink, drink, drink.

317
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,300
You should buy her a drink to thank her.

318
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,700
She looks beautiful inside and out.

319
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,500
And she is brilliant.

320
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,700
Where is she?

321
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Looks like she is leaving. I will buy her a drink next time.

322
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
It's a good thing we are WeChat friends now.

323
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,300
Excuse me for a second.

324
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,000
Didn't you just come back?

325
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
What is that about?

326
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,100
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

327
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
You have a companion.

328
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
Let's have a drink together.

329
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,600
Yue likes you.

330
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,200
I didn't know you were also attractive to girls.

331
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,900
You're more attractive to girls.

332
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,200
She's cute.

333
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,700
I like her, too.

334
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,400
Yue is young. She didn't know how to deal with that.

335
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
Thank you for your help.

336
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,200
I am tired.

337
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,300
Let's hang out another time.

338
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,000
Let me send you back.

339
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,700
Ruoshan.

340
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,900
That's my friend. See you later.

341
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,100
Where do you want to go?

342
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Just pull over and drop me off.

343
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,700
I know a good bar. How about a drink?

344
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,600
- Maybeâ€¦ 
 - I am tired.

345
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,100
   

346
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,300
   

347
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Shi Yan, we read the interview.

348
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,600
You did a good job.

349
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,400
Some of my friends also read it.

350
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,600
They praised you for being young and promising.

351
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
I am flattered, Mr. Tian.

352
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,600
We also read Chen Kang's interview.

353
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,300
- He is also great. 
 - Right.

354
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,400
We had dinner with your father yesterday.

355
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,500
We talked about Le'an's future.

356
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,400
Everyone is praising you for your unique vision.

357
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
We said you've made a lot of progress.

358
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
So this time, we will definitely support you.

359
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,000
We believe that Le'an will be the next unicorn.

360
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,500
After the acquisition of Le'an, we'll try our best to help them 
    

361
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,000
With Guan Capital on board,

362
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Mingyu Cloud Innovation will be well-funded.

363
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,000
We can consider cooperating with Lieying.

364
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,600
We can balance profits and relationships.

365
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,100
You're right.

366
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,500
Thank you for being supportive.

367
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,000
Chen Kang and I have made a long-term plan for Le'an.

368
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,200
Le'an will take the road of building Chinese chips in the future.

369
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,600
With leading technology, monetization is not a problem.

370
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,800
I never doubted Lieying's profitability.

371
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,300
Mingyu Cloud Innovation

372
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,400
wants to support young people who have the idea of starting a business.

373
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,300
We hope to use funds and time to support and accompany them to start their own businesses.

374
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,700
Lieying is a well-established company.

375
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,400
Mingyu Cloud Innovation doesn't want to invest in it.

376
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,600
All right.

377
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,100
You are the CEO of Mingyu Cloud Innovation,

378
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,200
on those things, it's your decision.

379
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Uncles, take care.

380
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,700
It feels good to be back in college.

381
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,600
Come here when you have time.

382
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,800
And listen to Professor Yu's lectures.

383
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,000
Just call me Yu You.

384
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
When I was in school,

385
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
there were no young and handsome professors like you.

386
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,600
It feels like calling you professor is also calling you old.

387
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,100
If I hadn't met you in person,

388
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,200
I would have thought that the person who wrote the article about Zhu Xingguo

389
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,800
and who interviewed Shi Yan to be an experienced old journalist.

390
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,000
Actually, Iâ€™m very curious. China is certainly good,

391
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
but it's freer abroad.

392
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,800
Why did you return to China?

393
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,500
Because I am needed here.

394
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,800
And there are many like-minded friends.

395
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,500
Are you talking about Mr. Guan?

396
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,200
Not just him, but Shi Yan.

397
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:12,279
   

398
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
Excuse me, I need to answer it.

399
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,000
 Yi, what are you doing?  
 - Mom, I am working.

400
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,400
 Why are you so busy? 

401
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
 You have to make time to hang out. 

402
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
 Find a boyfriend. 

403
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,800
 You need to be aggressive when it comes to relationships. 

404
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,000
 Don't sit and do nothing.  
 - I hear you.

405
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,700
Don't worry. I will definitely take the initiative when I meet the right person.

406
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,300
I really can't talk to you anymore. I have to go. Bye-bye.

407
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,700
Are you being pressured to get married?

408
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,500
Been there. My mom does that.

409
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,400
Why do I suddenly feel like I regret meeting you too late?

410
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,000
We should have a lot to talk about.

411
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I think so.

412
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,800
But then again, what do you think of Shi Yan?

413
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,600
Since you are like-minded,

414
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,400
what are you going to do together next?

415
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,000
Sorry, I can't give you spoilers in advance.

416
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,800
I understand.

417
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
I asked you out because I wanted to interview you.

418
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,100
I want to know your reasons for returning to China and your plans for the future.

419
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,200
Maybe the interview will bring more people back.

420
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,600
Okay, no problem.

421
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,800
It's my pleasure.

422
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,100
I want to invite you to the Guan Capital's press conference.

423
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,400
You'll get some answers at the conference.

424
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,600
And you will get some material for the interview.

425
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,800
Sure!

426
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
Thank you, Professor Yu.

427
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,700
You're welcome.

428
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,659
Great, hope to see you soon in Le'an.

429
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,500
Mr. Shi, can I move forward with the signing of the contract with Le'an?

430
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,940
No rush.

431
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,800
Bringing Bruce on board the R&amp;D team is an important step.

432
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,200
We've finished that.

433
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Now we have to solve internal problems.

434
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,800
Why do I feel like I we are surrounded by internal and external troubles?

435
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,400
Good things come in many ways.

436
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Have you not seen the light before dawn now?

437
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,400
There's no end to it.

438
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,300
Zheng Shuyi will also attend the Guan Capital's press conference.

439
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,600
I donâ€™t know who she hooked up with and what tricks she played this time

440
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I donâ€™t know who she hooked up with and what tricks she played this time?

441
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,500
Maybe it was Shi Yan who set her up.

442
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Using her looks

443
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
just to rob others.

444
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,600
She is so wicked.

445
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,539
   

446
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,800
Shiyue, please shred these scrap manuscripts.

447
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,100
- I am going to meet the chief editor. 
 - Okay.

448
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,800
I am sorry, Ms. Yuling.

449
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,400
No worries. Pick them up.

450
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,700
Beier, you're shredding papers too.

451
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,000
I have a large pile.

452
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It will take some time to shred them all.

453
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,100
Let me know when you are done. I have a manuscript to finish.

454
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Just put them down. I will shred them for you.

455
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,800
Thank you, Shiyue.

456
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
My pleasure.

457
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,800
   

458
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,400
Nannan, did you see my invitation?

459
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
Invitation?

460
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
The invitation to Guan Capital's press conference.

461
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,200
I left it on the desk.

462
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,700
I just got back. I didn't see it.

463
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,600
Look for it.

464
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Yue, did you see my invitation?

465
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I didn't.

466
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So weird. I left it here.

467
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,900
I was shredding paper in the utility room.

468
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,700
Shuyi, Shiyue didn't do that on purpose.

469
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,800
Don't blame her. She's new here.

470
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,200
- She doesn't know anything. 
 - She's right.

471
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,400
You are so resourceful. You'll definitely get another one.

472
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,800
I didn't do it.

473
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,200
It was not in the files I took.

474
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,900
Could it be that the invitation ran away on its own?

475
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,200
Shiyue, I have to tell you.

476
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
When you do something wrong, admit it.

477
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
It's not a big deal.

478
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,500
I will admit it if it was me. But it wasn't me.

479
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,600
Yue, it's fine. It's just an invitation.

480
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,000
They invited me.

481
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I don't need an invitation to get in there.

482
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,400
Your group's manuscript was stuck to my invitation.

483
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Beier, what do you want to say?

484
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,300
Iâ€¦ I didn't do that.

485
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,000
I went to the utility room with Ms. Yuling's scrap manuscripts.

486
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,600
Shiyue was there.

487
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,800
Shiyue said she would shred them for me.

488
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,400
Was that you who passed the manuscripts to Shiyue?

489
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,600
 Beier, please shred these scrap manuscripts. 

490
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 - Okay. 
 - Thank you. 

491
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,700
All right, you didn't mean to do it.

492
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,400
Ms. Shuyi is a reasonable woman.

493
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,000
You will be fine.

494
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Ms. Shuyi, I am sorry.

495
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,700
It's all my fault.

496
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,000
Beier, it's not your fault.

497
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,800
I hope you will learn from this

498
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,500
that if it's not your fault, don't admit it.

499
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,100
Xu Yuling is totally over the line.

500
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Jealousy drives people crazy.

501
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,400
I blame you for being too excellent.

502
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Have you read the data of the e-newsletter?

503
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,700
The number of reads has made history.

504
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,700
But I heard that many readers left messages in the background saying they like this format.

505
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,900
Remember to send a message to thank Mr. Shi.

506
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,200
Shanshan asked me to ignore him for a few days.

507
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
â™«  Not accidentally  â™«

508
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,000
He won't reply to my message.

509
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,600
â™«  It's not just a coincidence  â™«

510
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,400
   

511
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
 He doesn't have my WeChat. 

512
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,500
 He can't see my WeChat messages. 

513
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,800
   

514
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,800
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

515
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,200
   

516
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,500
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

517
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,400
â™«  If love is like a cloud  â™«

518
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,900
   

519
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,800
â™«  Always erratic  â™«

520
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,400
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

521
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,000
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

522
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,200
   

523
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,000
   
 The audio format is quite innovative. 

524
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
â™«  I will also be breathless  â™«

525
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,200
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

526
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,800
   
   

527
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,400
   
 This is really the iron tree blooming. Sow climbing the tree.  

528
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,800
 You can even do your own publicity. 

529
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,300
 Can I still hear Mr. Shiâ€™s voice? 

530
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
 He's kept a low profile. This is huge. 

531
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,800
â™«  I can't grasp it, so I take a deep breath  â™«

532
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,800
 I don't have her WeChat. 

533
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
 She can't see my WeChat messages. 

534
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,700
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

535
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,100
â™«  No need to ask, I am willing  â™«

536
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,600
Guan Ji, it's so nice of you.

537
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,200
Thank you.

538
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,400
What do you want Guan Ji to do for you?

539
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,600
It's not for me.

540
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
It's for my manager.

541
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,200
It's not for my manager.

542
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I don't know how to put it.

543
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,000
Did she ask you to do it?

544
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
No, I'm doing it voluntarily.

545
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,200
Qin Shiyue, you are a grown woman.

546
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,600
You have to be discerning.

547
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,400
Don't just do what you're asked to do.

548
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,000
What did I do?

549
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,100
Who asked me to do things?

550
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
It's all right. Thank you.

551
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,300
I'll think of something else.

552
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,800
Shiyue, who put this on my desk?

553
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,100
Don't get me wrong.

554
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,000
I called someone from Guan Capital's PR Department.

555
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
They checked the guest list and gave me this.

556
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,900
You don't have to thank me. It's what I should do.

557
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,800
Thank you.

558
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,000
Ms. Shuyi, here's a gift for you.

559
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,700
I think this color fits you well.

560
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,300
I should give you a gift.

561
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,500
No, this is a return gift.

562
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,200
You gave me a lipstick last time.

563
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,700
This is a return gift.

564
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,400
 It's an expensive gift. 

565
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,800
 She must come from a noble family. 

566
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,700
 That's why she knows someone from Guan Capital. 

567
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,000
Yue, this gift is so expensive that I can't take it.

568
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,600
If you want to thank me,

569
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,700
work more and work hard.

570
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,100
Iâ€¦

571
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,600
 Why does she always ask me to work more? 

572
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,400
Do you think itâ€™s okay for Guan Ji to come to power?

573
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,500
I think there should be no problem.

574
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,800
 Where are you? 

575
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,200
   

576
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,000
Distinguished guests and media friends, thank you for coming.

577
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,800
In the past year, the industry has shown a situation where all the gold has been exhausted.

In the past year, the industry has shown a situation where all the gold has been exhausted.

579
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,500
The industry has also ushered in huge changes.

580
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
The innovation of technology and business models

581
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,200
has become a breakthrough for the entire industry at this stage.

582
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,500
Therefore, persistence in seeking truth and innovation will always be Guan Capitalâ€™s pursuit.

583
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,000
Therefore, persistence in seeking truth and innovation will always be Guan Capitalâ€™s pursuit.

584
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,600
How did you get such a good seat?

585
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Someone gave it to me.

586
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,800
How did you get in here?

587
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,500
I just walked right in.

588
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,979
 He looks more handsome when he's serious.
