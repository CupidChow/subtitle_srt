 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:32,280
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,605
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:38,680
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,280
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,805
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,205
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:50,691
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:54,030
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,005
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,280
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,605
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,505
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,555
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:13,025
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:16,580
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,180
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,355
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:36,005
   

21
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,991
   

22
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:20,960
   

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,719
Dad. Mom. I have to go.

24
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,759
So early? Where are you going?

25
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,199
You're not eating?

26
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,660
No, I really have to go.

27
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,910
   

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,100
He hasn't texted me back.

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,980
After the IV, get some rest.

30
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,780
Then let's go home.

31
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,680
Didn't you just arrive in the city yesterday?

32
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,319
Why are you going home?

33
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,080
You're sick.

34
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,439
I'm actuallyâ€¦ fine.

35
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,560
You're fine and you have come to the hospital?

36
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,700
I just got here.

37
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,360
And I'm going back so soon.

38
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,940
And going back means going to work again.

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,940
Don't go.

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,863
Don't get me wrong. I want to work.

41
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:05,199
I like this job.

42
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,260
I've learned a lot and it helped me grow.

43
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,879
Since you're sick, don't go.

44
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,699
Stay home and get better.

45
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,279
What you've said makes sense.

46
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,920
Thenâ€¦ I'll ask for a few days off and rest at home.

47
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,179
I'll sit in the passenger seat.

48
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,050
   

49
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,319
Hello, miss.

50
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,719
I'd like to ask if there is a patient named Qin Shiyue.

51
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,720
She has finished her IV and was taken home by her family.

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
- Okay, thank you. 
 - No problem.

53
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,759
Taken homeâ€¦

54
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,519
Are you feeling better now?

55
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:52,840
 I'm at the hospital. Where are you? 

56
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,059
Shuyi.

57
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,982
It's almost noon. Youâ€¦

58
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,900
This is unusual.

59
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,039
What's wrong? You're not in a good mood?

60
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Nothing.

61
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,779
Mom, can you go out for a bit? I need to change clothes.

62
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,240
Go check on your daughter.

63
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,019
It's the Spring Festival. Why's she up so early?

64
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,240
She acts like she's possessed.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,079
Whether she gets up early or late, you're always going to nitpick.

66
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,020
The way I see itâ€¦ You're just looking for trouble.

67
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,400
When your daughter goes back to Jiangcheng, you'll miss her too much.

68
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
No one'll take you for a mute if you don't talk.

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,840
Fine.

70
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:15,239
Dad. Mom. I have some plans tonight. I won't be back for dinner.

71
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,240
It really seems like she's in a bad mood.

72
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,179
She's my daughter. How could I not know?

73
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:38,704
   

74
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,657
   

75
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:08,768
   

76
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,019
 Go back. Go to the aquarium. 

77
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,759
 Okay, Mr. Shi. 

78
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,659
You-You're not coming?

79
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,639
Am I supposed to act with you?

80
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,500
 It's okay. 

81
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,120
 But didn't you say 

82
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,480
 only with an in-depth understanding of your interviewee 

83
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,416
 can you write a profound interview article? 

84
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,447
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

85
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:00,247
Sorry.

86
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:08,153
â™«  Can a happy ending be fixed?  â™«

87
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,880
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:20,115
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

89
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:25,639
â™«  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  â™«

90
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,620
 You have your own career. 

91
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,759
 And you love your career. 

92
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,693
 When you focus on work, you look radiant. 

93
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,879
â™«  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  â™«

94
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,956
 And all that I'm proud of is nothing in our relationship. 

95
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:42,939
â™«  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  â™«

96
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,419
 I have been overwhelmed by your brilliance. 

97
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:50,140
 But I know, it's that light that attracted me. 

98
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,419
 And guided me to you. 

99
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:57,240
 I hope your light shines brighter and brighter, and my light too. 

100
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,286
 So we can shine together and leave no room for others. 

101
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,500
â™«  We're clearly already trapped in quicksand  â™«

102
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,020
 Shi Yan, I will definitely love you whole-heartedly. 

103
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,256
 I won't disappoint you. 

104
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:18,555
â™«  Don't say you can let go  â™«

105
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:23,586
â™«  Don't go far, okay?  â™«

106
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,600
She's already over 20, but she sleeps day in and day out at home.

107
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,979
Just like a pig!

108
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,280
It's the Spring Festival, but all she does is sleep.

109
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,900
I think she's going to be glued to the bed.

110
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,840
She doesn't even come out to help.

111
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,000
What a lazy girl.

112
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,420
I wonder how she manages alone in Jiangcheng.

113
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,480
Why worry so much?

114
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,400
Children have their own fortune.

115
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,120
You didn't hurt to death by giving birth to her.

116
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,919
Of course, you're not worried.

117
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,059
You're right. Absolutely right.

118
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,639
I wish our daughter's fortunate enough to find someone to take care of her.

119
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,519
Or she'll starve to death sooner or later.

120
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,479
Right, absolutely.

121
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,159
Youâ€¦

122
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,399
Time for dinner. Get up.

123
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
Do I have to say "My Lady, get up"?

124
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,540
Hurry up.

125
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,759
Sweetheart, come eat more.

126
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,860
Try your dad's cooking.

127
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,019
I ate the dough. I mean I rolled the dough.

128
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,480
"Ate the dough"?

129
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,939
I'm full.

130
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,779
Going to sleep so early?

131
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,080
You've been sleeping all day.

132
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,720
Are you trying to become the god of slumber?

133
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,540
I binge-watched shows all night, I'm so tired.

134
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,519
Don't worry about me.

135
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,639
Who else will worry about you if not me?

136
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,599
You brat.

137
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,840
Tomorrow, I'll play Mahjong with Ms. Chen.

138
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,480
We'll have dinner at her place.

139
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,400
Do you want to come along?

140
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,559
You've been back for several days and haven't seen Yu You.

141
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,979
I'm not going.

142
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,700
Not going?

143
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,079
Can a boyfriend grow out of the bed or be dreamed into existence?

144
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,319
Yu You is such a good kid. So many girls will kill for him.

145
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:38,099
All you know is to sleep. You don't work hard to maintain your relationship.

146
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,879
You won't get a boyfriend by simply doing nothing.

147
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,499
Children will have their own fortune. Why worry so much?

148
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,100
Shut up.

149
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,639
Hurry up and eat.

150
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,599
Do you know how hard it is to wrap dumplings?

151
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,619
These have chive filling.

152
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,879
She slept all day yesterday,

153
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,700
Now she's not coming out for breakfast.

154
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,139
It really seems something is off.

155
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,999
I'll go check on her.

156
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,240
Shuyi.

157
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,060
Did something happen?

158
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,340
Do you have a fever?

159
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,859
No, you're not.

160
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:52,620
Is work not going well?

161
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,540
Or did you encounter some other problem?

162
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,460
If work isn't going well, there's always a solution.

163
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,360
Go to your dad if it really doesn't work out,

164
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,159
In his life, there hasn't been a problem he can't solve.

165
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,080
If you really can't stand it, let's not stay in the big city.

166
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,300
Come back home.

167
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,520
Qing'an is a beautiful place.

168
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,559
Your dad and I will buy you a flat and a car.

169
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,300
We can still live comfortably.

170
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,139
If it's a problem with relationshipsâ€¦

171
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,039
Hang in there a bit and things will get better.

172
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,960
You're still young.

173
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,399
You will meet many people in the future.

174
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,879
There's no one who is irreplaceable.

175
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:50,140
A few years later, you'll have your own children and family.

176
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,300
Looking back.

177
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,340
Given enough time,

178
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,260
those deeply etched memories will be forgotten.

179
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,300
It's not even as lasting as eyebrow makeup.

180
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,179
Mom, I did something wrong.

181
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,240
If you did something wrong, so be it.

182
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,419
Who doesn't make mistakes when they're young?

183
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,780
Just don't make the same mistake in the future.

184
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,039
There's no future.

185
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,800
Silly girl, what are you talking about?

186
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,939
What do you mean "no future"?

187
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,340
Time is hope.

188
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,619
There's always hope.

189
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,577
Feeling better?

190
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,000
Get up if you feel better.

191
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,680
Lazing in bed all day is not good for you.

192
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,659
By the way. Remember to share the link for the most popular teacher of Qing'an University

193
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,400
to your WeChat Moments.

194
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,580
Ask your friends to vote for your mom.

195
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:56,586
   

196
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,219
Bruce is really heartless.

197
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:04,740
There's really no progress now.

198
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,179
Heartless indeed.

199
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:14,939
No conscience at all.

200
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:28,109
   

201
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:34,500
Qing'an University?

202
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:42,540
   

203
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,000
Hello.

204
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,939
Who is it?

205
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,019
You are?

206
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,480
Hello, ma'am. I am Yi Yang.

207
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,019
I'm looking for Shuyi.

208
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,000
Looking for Shuyi?

209
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,480
Young man, I've never seen you before.

210
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,200
nor has Shuyi ever mentioned you.

211
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,400
I've only recently met Shuyi.

212
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,759
I'd like to see her.

213
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,640
Oh, boy.

214
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,680
So it's you, huh?

215
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,440
Did you upset Shuyi and hurt her feelings?

216
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,088
Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I didn'tâ€¦

217
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:21,720
You're quite young.

218
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,559
You're younger than Shuyi. Right?

219
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,200
Being young is no excuse.

220
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,200
In a relationship, someone has to take the initiative. Right?

221
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,960
If both parties are passive, the relationship's not going to last.

222
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,300
Did you take her for granted after proactively pursuing her and winning her heart?

223
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,720
No, ma'am.

224
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,900
Luckily, it's not too late.

225
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,680
Next time, you have to comfort her on the spot.

226
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,620
No, there can't be a next time.

227
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,119
Shuyi has been spoiled since she was a child.

228
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,960
She's always been excellent.

229
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,480
So she's a little proud.

230
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,000
But she's very simple at heart and soft-hearted.

231
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,640
You should be nicer to her.

232
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,080
Say something nice. And she definitely won't stay mad.

233
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,800
Did you get it?

234
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,640
I get it.

235
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,680
Okay, then get in.

236
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,839
Come on. Come in and sit.

237
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,680
Shuyi, look who's here.

238
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,799
Who is it?

239
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,319
Why are you here? Why did you come?

240
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,139
Zheng Shuyi, happy new year.

241
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,659
Happy new year.

242
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,640
Shuyi, he came all the way here to meet you.

243
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,720
Be a nice host.

244
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
Your dad went fishing.

245
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,419
As for me, I'm going to play Mahjong with some friends.

246
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,799
I have to go.

247
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,240
I didn't know you're going to play Mahjong today. Didn't youâ€¦

248
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,020
Thank you, Auntie.

249
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,300
Qing'an is not big. Check the travel guide.

250
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,319
I can give you some advice regarding your travel plan.

251
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,880
You can take the high-speed train back to Jiangcheng tomorrow.

252
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,340
I'm in the middle of something. Excuse me.

253
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,960
Are you hungry?

254
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,720
Try this. See if it suits your taste.

255
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,260
Why did you come to Qing'an?

256
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,160
Don't tell me you didn't know I came to Qing'an for you?

257
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:59,179
 Don't tell me you didn't know I came to Qing'an for you? 

258
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,619
Zheng Shuyi,

259
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,559
when man comes all the way to meet you at the Spring Festival,

260
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,340
there is only one reason why he's doing so.

261
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,079
Stop joking, kid.

262
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,200
Have fun and then go back.

263
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,319
Call me "kid" if you like.

264
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,800
Zheng Shuyi,

265
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,759
but if you're rejecting me because of it, I'd feel it's very unfair.

266
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,900
Yes, you're right.

267
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,380
Sorry.

268
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,420
But we're not possible.

269
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,559
Are you sure we're not possible now that you've broken up with Shi Yan?

270
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,060
What are you talking about?

271
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,000
After dinner, would you mind taking me to see your high school?

272
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:57,709
   

273
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,019
Let's go. The school's not open.

274
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,480
What's with that expression?

275
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,479
It's just a pity.

276
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:20,619
Because... I want to know your past and what you were like.

277
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,939
Shuyi,

278
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,479
I hope you can take this opportunity to consider me properly.

279
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,579
Yi Yang, this is not an opportunity.

280
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,400
I already have someone else in my heart.

281
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,119
- I know. But he's already leftâ€¦ 
 - He's left. But I can wait.

282
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,100
And I can catch up with him.

283
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,459
Since you can catch up then I can chase you, too.

284
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,477
Can you ride a bike? 
    

285
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,279
Let's race.

286
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:20,079
Yi Yangk, thank you for today.

287
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,060
So how do you want to thank me?

288
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:26,300
How aboutâ€¦ giving me a chance to pursue you?

289
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm not in a business to negotiate with you.

290
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,119
No bargain accepted.

291
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm done here.

292
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,540
I didn't expect this outcome for the three of us, the cream of the crop.

293
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,580
   

294
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:52,596
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

295
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:56,519
    
 â™«  But your eyes are avoiding me  â™«

296
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:04,300
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

297
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,274
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

298
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:12,330
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

299
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,259
â™«  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  â™«

300
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:21,880
 When I went to the hospital, the nurse said you had already left. 

301
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:26,985
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

302
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,187
â™«  But I'm afraid it's too late  â™«

303
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,680
   

304
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,340
 At the year's start, I should get luckier after all the suffering. Right? 

305
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,639
 She's in the hospital? 

306
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,725
I have to go. See you.

307
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,532
â™«  The courage to transcend time  â™«

308
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:51,158
â™«  Even if I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

309
00:26:51,158 --> 00:27:02,464
â™«  I'll let you know that I'm still where I am  â™«

310
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,820
 Which hospital are you in? 

311
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,459
 What's the matter? 

312
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,160
 Answer the phone, now! 

313
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:20,119
I think it's still this pink one and the blue set earlier. Right?

314
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,960
Are you okay?

315
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,680
Wh-What's wrong with me?

316
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:29,520
Weren't youâ€¦ in the hospital?

317
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,440
I'm fine.

318
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,000
- Come with me. 
 - Let go of her.

319
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,079
Who are you to drag her away?

320
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,580
- Let go of her. 
 - It's none of your business.

321
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,140
- It's okay, Nian. He's a friend. 
 - What?

322
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,300
You're going to marry him?

323
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,859
What's it to you?

324
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,140
Shanshan,

325
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,780
don't marry him.

326
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,379
What he can give you, I can give you too.

327
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,319
Do you know what you're saying?

328
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,259
Feelings aren't an auction.

329
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:30,459
You can't win by raising the bid.

330
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:35,260
Soâ€¦

331
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,500
Do you like me?

332
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,340
Let me answer first.

333
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,920
Bi Ruoshan,

334
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,359
I really like you.

335
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,180
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

336
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,659
Actually, when I was very young,

337
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,514
I watched my parents divorce.

338
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,340
Back then my mom told my dad

339
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,119
that she didn't want to wear out their passion anymore.

340
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,620
She was exhausted.

341
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,459
Now matter how good my father was, she wanted to give up the marriage.

342
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,839
These scenesâ€¦ have haunted me all the time.

343
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,437
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

344
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:34,480
Since then,

345
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,099
I've felt that marriage was not the destination of a relationship.

346
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:42,080
Every relationship will eventually wither.

347
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,380
Perhaps only a relationship that's close

348
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,110
yet distant can stay fresh and long-lasting.

349
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,920
So I've always interacted with you according to our game rules.

350
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,459
This is not because I like such relationships.

351
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,490
It's because I at least won't lose you this way.

352
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,880
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

353
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,459
After you rejected me last time,

354
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:07,984
I thought I'd leave it at that and move on.

355
00:31:07,984 --> 00:31:10,500
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

356
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,204
Butâ€¦

357
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,059
Even though I can fool everyone, I can't fool myself.

358
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:21,880
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

359
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:26,392
Shanshan...

360
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:30,519
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

361
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,880
I want to meet you somewhere other than bars and hotels.

362
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,519
I want to date you like a normal couple.

363
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,079
I want to establish a relationship that gives us both a sense of security.

364
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,359
I can get sad, too.

365
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,799
But I'm willing to expose my most vulnerable side to you.

366
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,860
Shanshan,

367
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,359
I can lose everything,

368
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,930
but I can't lose you.

369
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,110
I'm willing to trade all my most precious things

370
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,030
to be with you.

371
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,682
Butâ€¦

372
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:21,238
We're both not good at maintaining a devoted and long-lasting relationship.

373
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:29,290
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

374
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,379
I'm willing to try.

375
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,079
I'm willing to try for you.

376
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,720
For us.

377
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,340
Let's try being together. Okay?

378
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:46,729
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

379
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,405
But still, I won't marry you.

380
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:04,368
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

381
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,543
I don't want to get married yet.

382
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,319
Neither of us has seriously dated before.

383
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,824
Let's start with dating.

384
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:26,215
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

385
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:30,199
â™«  Even if we fall into the darkness  â™«

386
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:38,847
â™«  We will run forward with all of our might, shining brightly  â™«

387
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:46,098
   

388
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,000
At work, the job is the most important thing.

389
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,859
Zheng Shuyi, you can do it.

390
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,879
 - Come, give the specialties to everyone. 
 - Thank you. 

391
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,859
 Thank you, Ada. 

392
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,280
 Thank you, Ada. 

393
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,159
 Shuyi, I'm still not feeling well. 

394
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,480
 I won't go today. 

395
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,880
 Get some good rest. 

396
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,559
Shuyi,

397
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:27,119
what specialties did you bring back from Qing'an?

398
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,599
Our Qing'an specialty is beautiful women.

399
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,500
Do you want one of me?

400
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,259
How shameless!

401
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,759
Shanshan, he knows everything.

402
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,039
Are you back?

403
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,639
Can I come and see you?

404
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,119
Of course, you can.

405
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,559
You can stay with me however long you want.

406
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,900
It's better than being alone at home, over-thinking.

407
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,600
Sure. I'll wait for you.

408
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,599
Hey, honey, I can't have dinner with you today.

409
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,280
How many days? I will miss you.

410
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,400
 I don't know. 

411
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,679
Maybe you can let her go home at night.

412
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,199
- I'm used to sleeping in your bed. 
  - No way! 

413
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,719
I don't care.

414
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,840
You'll have to make it up to me later.

415
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,860
Okay. I'll make it up to you later.

416
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,760
I have to go. I have to pack things up at home.

417
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,320
How am I going to explain to him?

418
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,039
What should I do now?

419
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,160
Then make it up to him properly.

420
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,799
You want to confess to him that you approached him

421
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:33,639
to get back at a cheater and get your interview done.

422
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:36,079
But then you mistook him for someone else.

423
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,559
None of that matters anymore.

424
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,860
The fact is, he has a big issue with it.

425
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,619
He's mad that you approached him not for who he was.

426
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,819
With his love for you, he can't face these facts.

427
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,500
But I've fallen for him now.

428
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,519
I wanted to be honest with him.

429
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,599
I also wanted to apologize to him,

430
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,800
But he won't even listen to me.

431
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,159
He doesn't even want to contact me anymore.

432
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,220
There, there.

433
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,719
He's just angry right now.

434
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,920
Wait a while.

435
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,559
Then find a chance to talk to him properly.

436
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,159
Maybe he'll forgive you. Right?

437
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,599
Look, you two are already together.

438
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,480
He likes you.

439
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,440
It's not as bad as you think.

440
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,799
Really?

441
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:37,679
Really.

442
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,719
There, there.

443
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,159
 It's just for these few days. 

444
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,519
 Don't call me for the time being. 

445
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,479
 If you have something, send a message. 

446
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:10,220
 Don't be sad. I'll join you for lunch. 

447
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,559
You're awake.

448
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,659
I'm done here. You go freshen up.

449
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,120
Shanshan, I'm off to work.

450
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,220
I'm going back to my own place tonight.

451
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,880
Weren't you going to stay a few days?

452
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,339
 I'm not staying. I can't sleep well outside my own flat. 

453
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,439
She didn't notice anything. Right?

454
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:31,868
   

455
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:48,600
   

456
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:52,280
   

457
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,379
 So young and so capable. 

458
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:56,639
 Yi Yang's impressive. 

459
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,220
 Will he stay in the country in the future? 

460
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,519
 Yi Yang is definitely a genius. 

461
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,320
 How did he manage to start his business while doing tech research? 

462
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,719
 And he keeps so many hobbies. 

463
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,980
 How does he schedule his time? 

464
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,366
 Are there any interview extras? 

465
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,039
Ms. Yi, do you need anything?

466
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,760
I've already discussed it with the lead editor.

467
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,800
We can try out your idea.

468
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,719
You will decide the format and release time.

469
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,980
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

470
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,880
   

471
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,099
Ms. Zheng,

472
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:14,480
it seems you have some interest in me.

473
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,679
You like interviewing me so much.

474
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:19,780
Mr. Yi, it's the readers who are curious about you.

475
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,579
Okay. Got it.

476
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,920
A supplementary interview, huh?

477
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,699
I will tell you everything I know.

478
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,079
Many of my friends have chosen to return to China to start a business.

479
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,039
With such a good business environment now,

480
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,360
everyone wants to make a mark on the domestic stage.

481
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,220
Since returning home,

482
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,000
I feel like I've found roots and a new goal.

483
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,680
I should continue to stay here.

484
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,159
Yes.

485
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,599
There are always more opportunities at home than abroad.

486
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,280
You've answered my last question.

487
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,280
This interview has been successfully completed.

488
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,780
Have you thought about a feature on overseas students who return home to start businesses?

489
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,940
Returning overseas students?

490
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,400
I did have this idea before.

491
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,980
Then you plan it out.

492
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,660
If you want to do this feature, I can introduce you to a few people.

493
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,580
Really? Thank you.

494
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,039
By the way, I want to add an interactive session to your interview.

495
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,860
What do you think?

496
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,680
How to interact?

497
00:42:59,797 --> 00:43:05,810
   

498
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
