 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:32,239
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,564
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:38,714
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:41,339
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:45,864
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:48,364
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:50,750
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,989
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,064
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,239
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,664
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:06,489
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:09,524
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:12,984
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:16,339
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:20,289
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:26,514
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:36,064
   

21
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,950
   

22
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,259
Drinking might be a little boring.

23
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,939
Let's play a drinking game. Do you know the rules?

24
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,719
No, I don't.

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,679
But you can teach me.

26
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,880
Sure, I'll teach you.

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,560
One more time.

28
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,660
No more. You're drunk.

29
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,780
I'm not drunk.

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,460
Shi Yan, you're really something.

31
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,101
You haven't lost a single game.

32
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,819
I'm not good.

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm a failure today.

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Shi Yan.

35
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,980
Bruce's departure caught me off guard.

36
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,659
We weren't prepared at all.

37
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:16,319
I went to all the trouble to get him to join Le'an Tech.

38
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,920
I just didn't realize there was someone far better than me.

39
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:27,100
He's not as good as you are.

40
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,079
You're the only one who thinks so.

41
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,380
No, that's not true.

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,119
The board members asked me today why Bruce left.

43
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,719
They asked about my plan for Le'an Tech

44
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,740
and my plan for Cloud Innovation in the future.

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,500
I couldn't answer their questions.

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,019
I didn't even know how it all happened.

47
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,200
It's not your fault.

48
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,520
You're just an investor.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,039
Whether Bruce leaves or not, plus Le'an's problem.

50
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,859
You can't solve it alone.

51
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,760
What about Chen Kang? What did Chen Kang say?

52
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,439
Chen Kang just found out.

53
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,865
Bruce had compensated for all the financial losses.

54
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:30,220
The results of his previous research are staying at Le'an Tech.

55
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,660
But what's next?

56
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:38,059
Even Chen Kang doesn't know what to do.

57
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,379
Let me tell you a secret.

58
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,079
When I was an intern,

59
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,240
there was a time I worked my butt off revising a certain article.

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,679
I had to revise it twenty-seven times before it was finally approved.

61
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,200
And guess what?

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,659
The article was rejected. It wasn't published.

63
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:10,940
At that time, I didn't know what to do.

64
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,079
There was no one to help me.

65
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,840
I wasn't even sure if I could be a journalist.

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,580
I was so lost that I forgot to cry.

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,600
Why don't you ask me what happened next?

68
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,500
And then?

69
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,339
Then I thought, "If you're beaten by one single failure, it's too embarrassing."

70
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,780
I didn't publish my article in this issue.

71
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,480
Then I should write a better one for the next issue.

72
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,179
And then I'd get the front page next time.

73
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:44,400
The front page wouldn't be rejected?

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,879
And then in my first year as an intern, I actually got the front page once.

75
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,160
I was the first intern to get a front page.

76
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,500
Shi Yan,

77
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,920
who hasn't had a few setbacks?

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,639
Anyone who hasn't encountered setbacks won't succeed.

79
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,839
You have such long legs. There's no obstacle you can't walk past.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,242
When I work on the Cloud Innovation feature,

81
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:20,000
I wonder every day what a genius Shi Yan is?

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,679
He's smart and he's got a big dream. He also has a sense of responsibility.

83
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,000
If he doesn't succeed, who will?

84
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,279
- Shuyi. 
 - Search for "difficulty" online, then search for "solution".

85
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,900
You will find there are always more solutions than difficulties.

86
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,580
Iâ€¦

87
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,920
So.

88
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,560
Shi Yan, you can do it.

89
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,581
You founded Cloud Innovation and developed it to where it is today. You can do it.

90
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:53,100
You have to believe in yourself.

91
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:57,844
- Zheng Shuyi. 
 - Let me finish the sentence.

92
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,542
Now, you haveâ€¦

93
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,339
you have me.

94
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,959
You have Guan Ji.

95
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:12,319
You have Yu You, Chen Sheng, and me.

96
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,900
You have Guan Ji.

97
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,499
Andâ€¦

98
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:20,560
Think about me. Don't think about the difficulties.

99
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,859
Zheng Shuyi, don't talk so much.

100
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,140
Fine. Tell me what you want.

101
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,600
I want to kiss you.

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,488
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

103
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:43,573
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

104
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:49,375
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

105
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:58,245
â™«  We will run forward with all of our might, shining brightly  â™«

106
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,420
Hello, Mr. Shi.

107
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,700
 Good morning, Shi Yan. 

108
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,600
 Bruce has made up his mind. 

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,139
 There's no turning back. 

110
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,959
Guessed as much. Now we need to find a way to control the loss.

111
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,074
I'll have a meeting with Le'an Tech today. I'll discuss it with Chen Kang.

112
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,300
 Good morning. 

113
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,460
He's up so early.

114
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,260
My man's working so hard.

115
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,659
He has to work overtime on a weekend.

116
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,920
 Good morning. 

117
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 Your sweetheart just showed up. 

118
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,600
Since I'll work overtime in the office, I can't dress into something too fancy.

119
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,259
But Shi Yan likes me in red.

120
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,700
However, Shi Yan can't be asking me to work with him.

121
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,179
He just wants to stay with me. Right?

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,300
   

123
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,999
Oops!

124
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,340
I forgot that Shiyue, Yu You, and I were going to the art museum today.

125
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,400
 Shuyi, are you up? 

126
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,460
 I'm all ready. Should we leave now? 

127
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,080
 - Do you want me to pick you up?  
 - No, there's no need.

128
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,499
 - Do you want me to pick you up?  
 - No, there's no need.

129
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,759
I'm ready. I'm leaving right now.

130
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,039
 Okay. I'll see you later. Bye. 

131
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,659
Bye.

132
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:58,384
 I'll visit the art museum with Shiyue and Yu You before working overtime with you. 

133
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,559
He'd get jealous.

134
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,919
A little jealousy's fine but too much jealousy can hurt.

135
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,459
For your sake, I'd rather not tell you.

136
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:19,460
I'll finish the visit quickly and come back for you.

137
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,200
Shuyi, look!

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,600
Dedicated scholars are different.

139
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
He's so decent and well-cultured.

140
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,300
Not like my uncleâ€¦

141
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,600
 My uncle is nice, too. 

142
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,000
Not like my uncleâ€¦ who's good at everything.

143
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,200
Even if you praise him to the heavens here, he won't hear you.

144
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
Didn't you sleep well last night?

145
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
What? I put on three layers of concealer. It didn't work?

146
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
It works.

147
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Iâ€¦ I can only see a little bit if I look very closely.

148
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
That's good.

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Let's go.

150
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,200
Professor Yu.

151
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,000
You're here.

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Professor Yu, have you been waiting long?

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, I just got here too.

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,800
That's good.

155
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Well, let's go in first.

156
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,600
Hello.

157
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,000
Shuyi, are you familiar with Raphael?

158
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,800
Then you can let me do the talking.

159
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm professional.

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,800
Sounds good.

161
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,400
Raphael's study and internalization of Da Vinci's style made him very successful.

162
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,800
He refined the approach of depicting features and dynamics.

163
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
He weakened the contrast between light and dark.

164
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,900
Thus creating a noble, calm, and clear style of figurative art.

165
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Impressive, Shiyue.

166
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,400
I didn't realize you knew so much about art?

167
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,000
Not that much.

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,100
I've been memorizing over the past few nights everything the encyclopedia had to offer.

169
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,400
But once I am in front of the paintings, I can't remember a word.

170
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,000
I randomly said whatever came up in my mind. I don't even know what I'm talking about.

171
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,600
But both Professor Yu and you were fooled by me.

172
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
That will do.

173
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,300
Raphael is best known for his images of the Madonna.

174
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,400
She's dignified, elegant,

175
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,300
and beautiful lines.

176
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,100
The women in his paintings are beautiful, gentle, and vivid.

177
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,300
 Shuyi, how's your progress with Yu You at the show? 

178
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,000
 You're definitely watching the show with him. I won't disturb you anymore. 

179
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,700
 There's an event in the school this afternoon. 

180
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
School?

181
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,000
   

182
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
   

183
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Who's that?

184
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
His mom.

185
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,600
Don't worry. Though his mom is the dean of the art school.

186
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,000
That doesn't mean he knows anything about art.

187
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,000
Are you trying to comfort me?

188
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,500
Yes, I am.

189
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,800
You see. Your father and uncle both know about finance very well.

190
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
But you know nothing about it. Right?

191
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you, Shuyi.

192
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,400
 -   
 -   

193
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,400
Guan Ji.

194
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
You're number one again.

195
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,300
As usual, let's go for a drink after this.

196
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
Let's get Yaoyao and Mengmeng.

197
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,500
You guys go ahead. I'm not going today.

198
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,600
Guan Ji, what's wrong with you?

199
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,300
I haven't been able to ask you out at all recently.

200
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,600
You've changed. Are you planning to stop playing around?

201
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's go then.

202
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,500
Let's go.

203
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,500
It's almost time. I have to go back to work overtime.

204
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,700
Overtime?

205
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,400
Shuyi, are you sure you have to work overtime today?

206
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,800
 Shiyue, you should curb your curiosity sometimes. 

207
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
It's okay. I'll give you a ride.

208
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,500
No need. My cab is already here.

209
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,600
I'll see you later.

210
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,100
Be safe.

211
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,300
 How do I keep him here? How do I ask him to stay? 

212
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,300
 It's been a long time since we've been alone. I can't just let him go. 

213
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,300
 Dining, shopping, movies? 

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Ms. Qinâ€¦

215
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,600
When I ordered the tickets for the exhibition, I got two free movie tickets.

216
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,700
It's a literary movie. Let's go see it together.

217
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,900
Shouldn't there be three tickets?

218
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,100
That's right.

219
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,500
Why are there only two movie tickets?

220
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,100
I have time later.

221
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,600
That's great.

222
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,300
 Is the report on Juhe ready? 

223
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
 It's the weekend. 

224
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,400
 A loner like you can work overtime. 

225
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
 But Yu You is a normal person. 

226
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,600
 Maybe he's on a date. 

227
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
   

228
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,856
   

229
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,100
 Who are you watching the show with? 

230
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
 Me and my supervisor. 

231
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,600
 Andâ€¦ her friend. 

232
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,100
 What kind of friend? 

233
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,700
 The one from the blind date. 

234
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,300
It's too late to go back and change.

235
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,600
 Didn't you say you'd work overtime with me? 

236
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,500
 You're working remotely? 

237
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,400
 I'm here. 

238
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,600
 Hm. Who'd actually come and work overtime with you on the weekend? 

239
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
 Aren't you a bit touched? 

240
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
 Are you dissatisfied? 

241
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
 Go to the 8th floor to get the documents from Qiu. 

242
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,100
 Then come to the 12th floor. 

243
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,600
Do you really think I'm an errand girl?

244
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,700
You don't have a secretary?

245
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,300
Wait a minute.

246
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,200
 You thoughtâ€¦ What do you think? 

247
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,400
 Can't you figure out your place first? 

248
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
 You changed my schedule without knowing who's really important! 

249
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
 Is Zheng Shuyi a regular reporter? 

250
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,800
 Do you know who she is? 

251
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,400
 Is it as simple as you think? 

252
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
Ms. Zheng,

253
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,800
although I don't know what brought you here on the weekend,

254
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,200
but I'd like to remind you.

255
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Mr. Qiu's wife is the Vice President of a self-publishing media company.

256
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,600
If something shameful happens to her marriage,

257
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,000
she need only ask to make a big deal out of it.

258
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,400
You're reminding me?

259
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,900
What? You're out of the home-wrecking game?

260
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,100
Ms. Zheng, this is the public information that you can refer to.

261
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,400
If it's not enough I can have someone prepare more for you later.

262
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,500
That's enough.

263
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,200
 His mom is the dean of an art school. 

264
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
 He must have grown up with art in his heart. 

265
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,600
 But he didn't call me out and even watched this boring literary movie with me. 

266
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,300
 Judging from itâ€¦ Yu You should be more or less into me. 

267
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,000
 Accident. It was an accident. 

268
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
 I'm going to make it today. 

269
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,300
Are you okay?

270
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,900
Are you sleepy?

271
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,200
Yes, a little sleepy.

272
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,400
How aboutâ€¦

273
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,500
Let me take you home?

274
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,400
Yes.

275
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,300
Yu You has already contacted Bruce.

276
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,900
Bruce's still sticking to his own choice.

277
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,800
But Le'an Tech had its own research plan before Bruce arrived.

278
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,200
Bruce left behind his research result during his stay.

279
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,090
So you should communicate internally

280
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,700
and get back to your own research as soon as possible.

281
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,500
This way you can minimize the damage.

282
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,700
 It's not Qin Lezhi, is it? 

283
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,900
You're dressed so nicely.

284
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
What were you doing?

285
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,700
What do you think? Why am I dressing up?

286
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,800
Of course, it's for you.

287
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,700
Are you hungry?

288
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
No, I'm not.

289
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
Then why do you keep looking at me?

290
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,600
 He's so handsome. 

291
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,900
What's wrong with me looking at you?

292
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,600
How do you know I'm looking at you if you're not looking at me?

293
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I think I heard you say last time that you have a niece.

294
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,700
Then your niece must be very happy.

295
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,700
She can freely enjoy her life every day. She doesn't have to work. Right?

296
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,600
Who says she doesn't have to work?

297
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Even a rich girl has to work?

298
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,400
I thought she could just inherit her family business.

299
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,800
She doesn't have what it takes.

300
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,600
I'd be happy if she could manage a basic job.

301
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,800
No one can inherit a family business without working hard first.

302
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,600
I see. Then you've taught her well.

303
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,100
Why are you hiding?

304
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,500
Let me look at you properly.

305
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,700
I'm hiding because I don't want you to be enchanted by my beauty.

306
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,900
Me, being enchanted? What are you afraid of?

307
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,000
Afraid I'll eat you?

308
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,800
I'm looking forward to it.

309
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
Shameless.

310
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,000
You said it yourself first.

311
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Do you listen to everything I say?

312
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Yes.

313
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
I don't listen to whatever you say.

314
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,100
You asked me to work overtime. So I'm here.

315
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,200
Oh.

316
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,600
But now I'm really hungry.

317
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,100
It's the middle of the day, and we're in your office.

318
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,900
Are you sure this is appropriate?

319
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
What isn't good?

320
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Food and sex.

321
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Who said it's not allowed to work in the office during broad daylight?

322
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,400
If you say so I think I need to leave and use the bathroom.

323
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,300
Put away the stuff before you.

324
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,200
Let's get ready to eat.

325
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Why are you surprised?

326
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,400
Is it inappropriate to eat in the office and during the middle of the day?

327
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,200
We have a very strict system.

328
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,600
We're not allowed to eat in the office.

329
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,400
Come on in.

330
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,400
Thank you.

331
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,200
 Overtime, reading materials, work lunch. 

332
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,000
 Quite a tight schedule. 

333
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,905
I'm going to a meeting.

334
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:53,759
I'll leave you alone for a while.

335
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,480
Would you like to have a cupcake after dinner?

336
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,699
If you wantâ€¦

337
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,400
No.

338
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,480
 I feel like things are going in a different direction from what I imagined. 

339
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,659
 Are you free tonight? 

340
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:54,100
 Let's meet at our usual place. 

341
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,640
 I'll pick you up. 

342
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,902
   

343
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,200
 What's wrong? 

344
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:15,040
 I seem to have gotten off track and are heading in a different direction. 

345
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,739
 So quick! You two are alreadyâ€¦? 

346
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:21,879
 What are you thinking? 

347
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,359
 But I think heâ€¦ 

348
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,160
 What's wrong with him? 

349
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
 He's good. 

350
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,820
 So good that I can't control myself. 

351
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,939
 Then what's your plan now? 

352
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:44,639
At first, I approached him for Financial Introduce's front-page.

353
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:50,059
I wanted to secure an interview with him to impress Yue Xingzhou.

354
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:55,779
But now I don't seem to care if others are impressed or not.

355
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,780
Because I'm sure he likes me.

356
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,580
He'll get jealous of me and he's not holding anything back from me.

357
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,779
So I want to be with him.

358
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:15,719
Facing the unknown future, I want to overcome all difficulties together with him.

359
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,580
Wait a minute.

360
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,400
 I've been meaning to say this for a long time. 

361
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,820
 I think even if you don't want anything else, it's still worth it to be with him. 

362
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,480
 To say "worth" is an understatement. 

363
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,199
 You're super lucky. 

364
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,239
 Go for it, my dear. 

365
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,139
 I really hope you'll marry into a rich family. 

366
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,460
You're awake.

367
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,259
Why are you here?

368
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,020
This is my office.

369
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,960
Just now, youâ€¦

370
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,319
I washed my hands. Why?

371
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:19,800
 The restroom door was closed. 

372
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,960
 I don't think he heard anything. 

373
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,379
Nothing.

374
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,979
I was just surprised.

375
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:30,060
Is that so? Why didn't I notice that you get scared easily?

376
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,400
Are you treating my office like a hotel?

377
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,239
You're not doing your job.

378
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,400
I will work.

379
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,840
That was close.

380
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,159
Shi Yan almost overheard us talking.

381
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:18,000
 Go for it, my dear! 

382
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,699
 I really hope you'll marry into a rich family. 

383
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,079
 Zheng Shuyi, is that why you approached me? 

384
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,600
 Forget it. 

385
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,719
 I don't care what your purpose is as long as it's you. 

386
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,680
You guys didn't see it.

387
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,100
Let's go to the conference room.

388
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,860
Okay.

389
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,679
Do you want me to turn on the heater?

390
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:59,219
Yes, thank you.

391
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,579
Professor Yu, we were just passing by your office.

392
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,940
What's the matter?

393
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,380
I also often go to the Central Business District.

394
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,159
Which company have you been to?

395
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,879
IFS.

396
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,400
For interviews?

397
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,119
I usually go there to boost IFS' GDP.

398
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,039
 Menâ€¦ 

399
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,299
 They were born with the desire to conquer. 

400
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,380
 And let me tell you. 

401
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,199
 Sometimes when you try to beat around the bush, they just don't get it. 

402
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,180
 At critical moments, you have to be straightforward. 

403
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,440
 Leave them with no other choice but to face your question. 

404
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,420
Professor Yu,

405
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,676
do you have a girlfriend?

406
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,339
No, I don't.

407
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,220
What do you think of me?

408
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,900
You are good.

409
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,600
 That's good news. 

410
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,440
 So nextâ€¦ 

411
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,980
Wellâ€¦

412
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,840
Should we go to your place?

413
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,320
Saturday?

414
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,060
Two days of sightseeing shouldn't be a problem.

415
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,360
But I'll have to bring my computer.

416
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,760
Maybe I'll get an assignment all of a sudden.

417
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,360
Wait till I finish my meeting on Monday and make sure there's nothing else to handle.

418
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,119
Then I'll get back to you.

419
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,320
You're busy?

420
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,979
I've got to go.

421
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,239
What is it?

422
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,299
Next Saturday through Sunday, there'll be a chip conference in Fucheng.

423
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,000
Aren't you going?

424
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Chip conference?

425
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,280
Of course, I want to go.

426
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,619
It's just that I don't have their invite.

427
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,299
Now you do.

428
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,760
What? You don't want to go?

429
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Or do you want to go on a trip with your friend?

430
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,980
No, it's not what you think.

431
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,019
Even the chip conference can't attract you.

432
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,079
I'm attracted, that's for sure.

433
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,639
But what's more appealing isâ€¦

434
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,760
Will I be following you around throughout?

435
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,199
Yes.

436
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:00,880
Throughout.

437
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,459
Dining and staying together.

438
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:05,399
How is it?

439
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:08,479
I'd like to make one more request.

440
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:09,960
Yeah, sure.

441
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,772
If you're free on Friday, let's go to Fucheng, shall we?

442
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:17,420
I need to unwind and get some inspiration.

443
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,280
Yes.

444
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:28,415
   

445
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,759
- It's Yi Yang. 
 - That's right.

446
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:35,880
His live broadcast a while back was widely discussed online.

447
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,760
He looks so young.

448
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,736
I didn't realize he was so impressive.

449
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,800
- He's here for Shuyi again? 
 - I don't know.

450
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,060
I don't know. Let's go.

451
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,179
Mr. Yi, please.

452
00:41:57,179 --> 00:41:58,599
Thank you.

453
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,380
Mr. Yi, your previous press conference was a real eye-opener.

454
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,520
I really hope to have the opportunity to communicate with you.

455
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,880
As a senior reporter for Financial Introduce,

456
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,580
I can write a high-quality article for you

457
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,650
and increase your popularity in the industry.

458
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:27,380
Could you please hurry Ms. Zheng a bit for me?

459
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,259
One moment, please.

460
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,560
- You're here. 
 - Mr. Yi.

461
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,699
I still want you to write an article for me.

462
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,739
Why do you insist on having me do this interview?

463
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:05,060
Because I like you very much.
