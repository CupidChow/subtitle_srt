 "Lemon Soda"- Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:32,191
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,616
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:37,766
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,291
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,716
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,316
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:50,502
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:53,941
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:57,116
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,291
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,616
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:06,441
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,576
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:12,936
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:16,391
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:20,141
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:25,466
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:36,116
   

21
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:39,002
   

22
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,822
   

23
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:03,262
   

24
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,960
 It's been a long day and I crave a late-night snack. 

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,180
A long day?

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,380
What have you been busy with?

27
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,107
   

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,097
   

29
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:57,760
Shiyue,

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,020
what's going on?

31
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,380
I'm trying to get in touch with the big shots in the business.

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,855
Is it the article you were working on before?

33
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:11,300
Yuling says we need to get some big names in our articles.

34
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,900
But I've seen the specialist you cited. They should do the trick.

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,580
Shiyue, we write to come up with ideas and communicate them to our readers.

36
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,960
We don't simply paraphrase other people's ideas.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,019
A good article is never a collection of jargon.

38
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,599
And you don't have to cite other people to make it seem more authoritative.

39
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,399
But Yuling saidâ€¦

40
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,599
You've been working for a while.

41
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,180
You should be able to make your own judgment about what others say.

42
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,900
I've read your outline.

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,710
The framework is fine and the information is very detailed.

44
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:49,360
What you need to do now is enrich the first draft and adjust its wording.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,460
Get your first draft. Let's go over it to see where we can improve.

46
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,599
If any point seems unclear you'll have to confirm it.

47
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,460
Hello.

48
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,297
I'm Kong Nan, Financial Introduce's reporter.

49
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,360
Is Mr. Qin still on his way here?

50
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:13,880
Don't worry. Let's just casually chat for now.

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,900
Then we'll official start when Mr. Qin arrives.

52
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,340
Miss, you've got the wrong person, don't you?

53
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,900
Aren't you Mr. Chen Sheng?

54
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,376
I'm sorry. You have the wrong person.

55
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,139
Ms. Kong.

56
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:36,739
I'm sorry. I had the wrong person.

57
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:39,106
- My apologies. 
 - No worries. No worries.

58
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,680
You're Chen Sheng?

59
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,560
That's right.

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,820
Hello, Ms. Kong.

61
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,659
Hello.

62
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,120
May I ask how old you are.

63
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,918
I'm 25.

64
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:56,279
You've been working since you graduated?

65
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,319
Yes.

66
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,920
Once I graduated, I joined Cloud Innovation and worked for Mr. Shi.

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,619
We talked over WeChat, and you didn't seem like a post-95'.

68
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,658
I probably appear more mature when working.

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,639
You're a quick study, Shiyue. This is much better.

70
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,339
Thank you, Shuyi.

71
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,680
It's getting late. Let's call it a day.

72
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,879
Time to go home.

73
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,179
Read through and check it again tomorrow.

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Done!

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,399
 Did you eat? 

76
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,199
 How was your day? 

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,519
 It's been a good day. 

78
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,399
 Shuyi is back and she mentored me closely. 

79
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,279
 I, your dear niece, am incredibly perceptive. 

80
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,460
 I finally finished the job before midnight. 

81
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,519
 Shuyi is wonderful. 

82
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,779
 She's professional and patient. 

83
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,539
 She's got a lot of things to handle, but she still worked late with me. 

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,600
Shuyi, I'll leave now. Don't be late.

85
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,439
Go home now. Be safe.

86
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:18,959
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

87
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,459
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

88
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,580
Shi Yan hasn't shown up all day today.

89
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,280
   

90
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,099
 Wellâ€¦ I'm not alone. 

91
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,519
 Can someone help deliver a bed to the office. 

92
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,799
Perfect.

93
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,999
 Come down. 

94
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:25,600
Coming!

95
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,559
Ms. Zheng.

96
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,179
- Did you just get off work? 
 - I'm working overtime.

97
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,639
That's hard work.

98
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,439
You guys, too.

99
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,639
Speaking of whichâ€¦

100
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,639
I bet you haven't eaten anything since you've been working so late.

101
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,360
I warmed this tart up as a late-night snack.

102
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,000
Why don't you take it?

103
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:57,900
I saved this especially for you.

104
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,739
If you don't eat it, I'll have to throw it away.

105
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,380
Thank you.

106
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,519
- How much is it? I'll transfer it to you. 
 - No need.

107
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,639
The shop's account's closed today.

108
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,900
Are you waiting for a car?

109
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,600
It's so cold and it's dangerous to go back on your own at night.

110
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,339
Why don't I wait with you a little longer?

111
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,500
Iâ€¦

112
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,139
Let's go.

113
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,500
Did you pay?

114
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,859
Show me your payee code.

115
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,399
Thank you.

116
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,960
Want to talk some more?

117
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,760
That's quite enough.

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
Why did you come?

119
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,200
I was doing something nearby.

120
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,819
You're quite popular.

121
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:09,100
Average, average. Just about the same as you, Mr. Shi.

122
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,459
Are you hungry?

123
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,040
You want some?

124
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,360
It's too late. I won't eat.

125
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:07,000
You're not taking the passenger seat. Are you going to use me as a chauffeur?

126
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,159
- Slow down, Mr. Wang. 
 - Okay.

127
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,720
Slow down a bit.

128
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,179
I'll be going now, Xu.

129
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,460
I'll just be waiting for your response.

130
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,360
Get some rest, Mr. Wang.

131
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,060
See you.

132
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,759
Zheng Shuyi?

133
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,839
Shi Yan?

134
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,340
They're really together?

135
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,159
Who's talking behind my back?

136
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,393
   

137
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,899
Where are you going now?

138
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,919
I'm going for late-night snacks.

139
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,360
Didn't you say no late-night snacks?

140
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,919
With your routine considered, this meal isn't a late-night snack but dinner.

141
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,919
Are you sure we can dine out now?

142
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,060
Then can I have noodles?

143
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,060
- Do you know the way? 
 - Turn right at the crossroad ahead.

144
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,968
   

145
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,359
Thank you.

146
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,920
You're really not eating?

147
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,000
Their signature seafood noodles are delicious!

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,080
They fill your mouth with an aroma and aftertaste.

149
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,780
No.

150
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,399
Their noodles are really good.

151
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,599
You'll regret not eating them.

152
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,919
You should eat them quickly before the freshness disappears.

153
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,600
They don't do takeout so you have to come here for the noddles.

154
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
Lots of people wait in line during the day.

155
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,519
There are times in the evening when you have to wait for a table.

156
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,440
I haven't come here often since I started working.

157
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,220
When I was in school, I used to come here withâ€¦

158
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,608
 Eat. 

159
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:51,230
 Thank you. 

160
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:11,159
Let's eat here tonight, Xingzhou.

161
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,759
All right, let's go.

162
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,580
I'm going to the bathroom.

163
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,240
Boss, five bowls of seafood noodles.

164
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
On it.

165
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,420
- Shall we drink? 
 - Yes!

166
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,360
It's been a long time.

167
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,659
Xingzhou, we've been classmates for so many years, so you have to tell the truth.

168
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,279
Why did you suddenly break up with Zheng Shuyi?

169
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,260
- Yeah, I'm curious. 
 - Yeah.

170
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,380
Our temperaments are not compatible.

171
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,800
So which one of you initiated the breakup?

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,579
She's the one.

173
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,939
I guessed as much.

174
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,380
She's meeting richer people now.

175
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,140
She must've gotten picky.

176
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,100
With CEOs and CFOs around,

177
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,120
she's no longer into a nobody like you from an ordinary technology company.

178
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,479
You guys go ahead and eat. I suddenly don't feel like it.

179
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,639
Xingzhou.

180
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,399
Xingzhou! Xingzhou!

181
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,420
Where are you going, Xingzhou?

182
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,960
Xingzhou.

183
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,439
 Do you want me to fetch you? 

184
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,659
Sorry to keep you waiting.

185
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,900
Zheng Shuyi, head up.

186
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,547
Why?

187
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,039
Do I have something on my face?

188
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,639
There's nothing. I'm still beautiful.

189
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:07,658
What's the matter?

190
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,840
How come such big eyes have such bad eyesight?

191
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,159
Why are you mocking me all of a sudden?

192
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,039
 Does he know something. 

193
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,519
 No way. He doesn't know Yue Xingzhou. 

194
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,879
Yeah, you're right.

195
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,820
I couldn't see what was bad for me.

196
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,919
But I'm much more discerning now.

197
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,159
Maybe too discerning.

198
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,960
Talking to you like this is like playing the lute to a cow.

199
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,580
- What did you say? 
 - I said you're a cow.

200
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
Zheng Shuyi.

201
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,039
I was wrong. I was wrong.

202
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:58,420
Are you still eating?

203
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,899
I don't want to eat. I've lost my appetite.

204
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:11,559
He is a cow who doesnâ€™t understand style.

205
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,059
You don't have a clear picture of yourself.

206
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,399
 How unlucky to have run into the cheater. 

207
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,679
 I didn't get to eat the noodles and I'm hungry and sleepy. 

208
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,540
 Then there is this cow, who's in a bad mood. 

209
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,200
 Why is he in a bad mood? 

210
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,520
We're here.

211
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm going home. Safe ride home.

212
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,359
Zheng Shuyi.

213
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,720
What is it?

214
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Don't eat before bed.

215
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,360
Going to bed hungry not only causes hypoglycemia,

216
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,070
it also affects the quality of one's sleep.

217
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,640
Mr. Shi, take care of yourself.

218
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,300
I'll take care of myself, too.

219
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,900
See you.

220
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,993
Why is there nothing?

221
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:35,019
Forget it. I'll just order takeout.

222
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,079
I'm not listening to you.

223
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,319
You're not the one who's hungry.

224
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,859
I'm so hungry.

225
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,400
Where's my delivery?

226
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,300
I'm coming. Wait a minute.

227
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,619
I didn't order this.

228
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,500
 Open the door. Get the takeout. 

229
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,672
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

230
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,100
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

231
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:17,460
â™«  To travel through this long time with you  â™«

232
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:27,366
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

233
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:33,719
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

234
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:38,942
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

235
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:43,032
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

236
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:48,620
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

237
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,820
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

238
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,697
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

239
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:01,720
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

240
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,300
He's still nice and sweet.

241
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,400
He came back to bring me the Savory Noodles dish.

242
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,860
He cares about me for sure.

243
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,463
â™«  We were all shining stars  â™«

244
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:21,104
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

245
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:23,085
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

246
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:31,210
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

247
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:37,045
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

248
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:42,659
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

249
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,900
 The noodles are so good. 

250
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,299
 You don't eat green onions. 

251
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,779
 No, I don't. 

252
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:00,100
 Were you this sweet to your ex-girlfriend? 

253
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,240
 We're the same on that front. 

254
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,319
 Does he know? 

255
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,599
 I shouldn't have brought up his ex-girlfriend 

256
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,000
 with a tone that seems a little jealous. 

257
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,380
 He must be laughing at me. 

258
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,880
Zheng Shuyi, why do you care what Shi Yan thinks?

259
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,139
I'd never be jealous?

260
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,619
If there's any jealousy, it must be his ex who's jealous of me.

261
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,459
I can have takeout delivered by Shi Yan himself.

262
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:37,437
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

263
00:22:37,437 --> 00:22:40,000
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

264
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,379
 There's no need to starve for unimportant people. 

265
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:47,979
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

266
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,900
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

267
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:57,881
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

268
00:22:57,881 --> 00:23:03,962
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

269
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:07,680
â™«  Even if we fall into the darkness  â™«

270
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,902
â™«  We will run forward with all of our might, shining brightly  â™«

271
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,819
Nannan, pour one for me, too.

272
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,559
I just bought it. I haven't drunk it yet.

273
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,459
You drink it.

274
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,379
Good morning, Yuling.

275
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,340
What's wrong with her?

276
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,440
Do I look like I know?

277
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,160
It's not poisoned, is it?

278
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,060
Time for the meeting.

279
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,280
- Shuyi, turn on the lights. 
 - Let me do it.

280
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,962
Today's topic's fun.

281
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:19,300
Let's talk about one of everyone's favorites, currency.

282
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:25,139
Of course, we're mainly talking about the supply and demand for currency.

283
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,799
Before we begin this lesson, let's take a look at

284
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,917
our monetary system.

285
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,160
It's almost New Year's Day. The holiday's around the corner.

286
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,540
Do a bit of wrapping up before the year's end.

287
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,100
Also, the Guans are throwing an appreciation dinner.

288
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,959
Yuling, you'll go since the Guans are your client.

289
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,359
I have another interview on that day. Could you send Shuyi instead?

290
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,500
What did you say?

291
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,060
I have another interview on that day. It'd be better to have Shuyi go.

292
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,619
What's wrong with her?

293
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,240
I've been working on a new car battery project so I might not have time.

294
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,540
How about giving the task to Kong Nan?

295
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,880
Me?

296
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,319
Okay, then.

297
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,359
Now for the internship.

298
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,200
The interns in both groups are doing well.

299
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,979
Then it's time to move onto the internship assessment.

300
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,640
You have to keep up the good work.

301
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,319
As their mentors, what do you two have in mind?

302
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,920
Beier has been working hard.

303
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,219
I'm going to mentor her and help her get in.

304
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,525
Shuyi, what about you?

305
00:25:45,525 --> 00:25:47,920
Shiyue is able to draft articles now.

306
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,179
Next, I want to take her with me on a feature on Cloud Innovation.

307
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,080
No, no, Shuyi. Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

308
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,559
But the feature on Cloud Innovation is so important a project.

309
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,039
I've only improved a little bit. I'd prefer not to be a burden to you.

310
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,400
I need to keep studying hard.

311
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,300
But I can help Shuyi with some other work.

312
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,680
Professor Yu,

313
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,340
what's the matter?

314
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,446
This is the first time you've called me. I'm so happy.

315
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:26,880
Ms. Qin, please don't have other people come and record my course.

316
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,739
Iâ€¦

317
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,239
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,640
I've been so busy lately, soâ€¦

319
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,100
This is a basic course.

320
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,300
If you don't have time you can study on your own at home.

321
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,740
 If there's anything else you don't know ask me next time you come to school. 

322
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,540
But please don't send people to record the classes again.

323
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,459
It will interfere with my students' learning.

324
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,580
I know. I won't next time.

325
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,000
I'll read by myself at home, and try to come to your lectures in person.

326
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,039
Thank you.

327
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,540
Yu You called me.

328
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,040
He also said I can ask him in person if I have questions.

329
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,859
Does this count as a date?

330
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,359
 You bought me noodles the other day. 

331
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,640
 I'll make it up to you tonight. 

332
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,359
 Hm. 

333
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,199
 I'll decide what to eat. 

334
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,220
 Hm. 

335
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,340
 Then pick me up from work. 

336
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,700
 Hm. 

337
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,200
"Hm... Hm..."

338
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,422
What are you, a hmmm-bot?

339
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:49,320
Who knows what you think since you don't talk at all!

340
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:53,680
 Are you in a bad mood again? 

341
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,280
 Hm? 

342
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,599
 The other night, 

343
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,140
 you seemed to be in a bad mood on the way back. 

344
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,880
 But then you went and bought me some noodles and you seemed to feel better again. 

345
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,799
 Do you have nothing better to do? 

346
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,939
 Thinking about whether you're happy is the most important thing. 

347
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,780
- This article... 
 - How is it?

348
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,019
Isn't it overly critical?

349
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:41,720
After all, they're our clients, Shiyue.

350
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,890
I know, that's why I checked

351
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,670
all the information before I wrote it.

352
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,274
Polish it up a bit.

353
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,400
Chief Editor, media speaks for the public.

354
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,759
It's also the conscience of society.

355
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,240
You can't say something that's contrary to the fact.

356
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,899
I can't exaggerate and I will not.

357
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:07,074
Like teacher, like student.

358
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,319
You're exactly like that Zheng Shuyi.

359
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:13,160
Shuyi taught me to be realistic, to have a point of view, to have an attitude.

360
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,680
We can't just write what the interviewee says.

361
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,079
Okay.

362
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:19,319
Then go get Zheng Shuyi for me.

363
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,620
This intern is surprisingly upright.

364
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,400
I did teach her this.

365
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,000
But I didn't expect her to use it on PR pieces.

366
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,769
Our chief editor told her to revise it.

367
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,799
And she held on to the principles I told her and rejected the chief editor.

368
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,959
Our chief editor is almost having a headache.

369
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:39,540
You do have an interesting intern.

370
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,739
 You're complimenting her already? 

371
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,440
 You usually don't even praise me. 

372
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,020
Yeah.

373
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,139
She's got vision and good taste.

374
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:53,219
She's been particularly motivated lately.

375
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:56,379
She often goes to the University of Finance and Economics for Professor Yu's class.

376
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,519
This class taught by Professor Yu is hard to come by.

377
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,379
She's been going to his class regardless of all the difficulties.

378
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:07,400
I've listened to Professor Yu's course before.

379
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,200
It's super engaging.

380
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
He's really a good lecturer.

381
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,230
If I'd met a handsome and interesting finance professor

382
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,740
like Professor Yu back in my college years,

383
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,880
I'd have definitely majored in finance.

384
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Then the world of financial journalism would have lost a rising star.

385
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,680
Really?

386
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,780
 He's getting jealous because of Yu You. 

387
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,840
 Shanshan's right. 

388
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,600
 Men like to conquer what they can't have. 

389
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,627
That can't be more true.

390
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:44,239
Professor Yu is three years older than you.

391
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,740
But I've seen him a couple of times.

392
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,740
He looks younger than you in person.

393
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,480
He's also a little more outgoing.

394
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,279
I forgot about it before.

395
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,200
He is famous in Qing'an.

396
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,880
I heard he skipped two grades.

397
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,559
He was in college when I was in middle school.

398
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,260
And then he went on to graduate from Harvard with honors.

399
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,120
Then he went to Cambridge and earned dual degrees.

400
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,540
His articles are frequently cited.

401
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,999
I hear he's also particularly fond of sports.

402
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:17,740
Oh, my god, a young, handsome, funny, and talented professor!

403
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,640
No wonder students adore him.

404
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,379
You adore him, too.

405
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:27,486
Come on. Everyone adores him.

406
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:34,240
Where are you going?

407
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,680
Aren't we going to eat?

408
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,860
Since you like taking courses, let me teach you something.

409
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,620
Teach me something?

410
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:48,477
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

411
00:31:48,477 --> 00:31:53,117
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

412
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:56,579
We're not eating. And you're showing me these.

413
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,450
What is this for?

414
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,317
Just now, all of a sudden, I felt that you should broaden your horizon

415
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:04,799
and understand that some things are common.

416
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,739
Otherwise, you'd take something common as unique.

417
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:10,444
Common?

418
00:32:10,444 --> 00:32:14,019
â™«  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

419
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:18,219
 I guess it has to do with the fact that I complimented Professor Yu. 

420
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,319
â™«  Roses are the most dangerous yet noble  â™«

421
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,080
It turns out that Mr. Shi is not only good at reading but also knows so many things.

422
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm jealous and almost feel a bit ashamed in comparison.

423
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,720
   

424
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,390
How do you manage to keep so many hobbies while also being so knowledgeable?

425
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,520
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

426
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,570
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

427
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,580
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

428
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,470
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

429
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:51,054
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

430
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:56,202
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

431
00:32:56,202 --> 00:32:57,680
2015.

432
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
2016.

433
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,480
2017.

434
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,020
2018.

435
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,079
How come there's no 2019?

436
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,920
There's nothing for the years afterward.

437
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,160
In 2019, I left Mingyu and founded Cloud Innovation.

438
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,518
Then I got busy with work and didn't even have time to jog.

439
00:33:10,518 --> 00:33:12,820
â™«  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

440
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,559
So, why did you leave Mingyu at that time?

441
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,840
â™«  Bitter and hurt  â™«

442
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,520
I'm just asking. You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

443
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,829
â™«  Addicted to gentleness  â™«

444
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:27,755
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

445
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,534
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

446
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:38,920
I've been very interested in investing since I was in grad school.

447
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,880
I wanted to find a relevant job after graduation.

448
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,239
But after graduation, I joined Mingyu as my father had wished.

449
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:50,680
At that time, Mingyu was already very large and had many employees.

450
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,459
Many of the children of our old employees would join Mingyu after graduation.

451
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:58,160
To outsiders, Mingyu looks like an aircraft carrier.

452
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,479
However, its management lacks science and modernization.

453
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:05,540
It was overly reliant on scale and capital.

454
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,659
Companies like this will be inflexible and out of step with the times.

455
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,899
I noticed this back then.

456
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:14,319
And gave a lot of suggestions.

457
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:20,400
But Mingyu is the life's work of my father and his friends.

458
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,159
It's hard to change some things.

459
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,920
So, my brother-in-law would be better suited to keep this family corporation.

460
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,880
So you gave it to your brother-in-law.

461
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,219
To say "give" is inappropriate.

462
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:38,380
My brother-in-law also did a lot for Mingyu.

463
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,180
He deserves it.

464
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,320
And I have my own dream.

465
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,719
I want to help entrepreneurs who want to make society a better place.

466
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,279
I want to explore more possibilities.

467
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,000
Shi Yan, I think you're very brave.

468
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,639
For a person to break the original pattern and persist in practicing his or her dreams and visions,

469
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,879
it's really brave.

470
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,760
Not to mention. You gave up something that a lot of people would kill for.

471
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,260
You faced huge pressure in this process,

472
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,839
putting up with gossip and working hard in silence.

473
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,059
But you did it, and you did it well.

474
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,119
Really?

475
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,974
Then what's the reward?

476
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:52,338
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

477
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:56,045
â™«  It's your shining eyes  â™«

478
00:35:56,045 --> 00:36:01,037
â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

479
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:06,653
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

480
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:09,659
â™«  Luckily, you didn't go far away  â™«

481
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:17,515
â™«  I can still tightly hold your hand  â™«

482
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:23,901
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

483
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:31,365
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

484
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:36,333
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

485
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:43,962
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

486
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,080
Hello.

487
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,479
 Mr. Shi, your business trip has been arranged. 

488
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,739
You don't have to call me for such trivial matters in the future.

489
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:08,139
 Zheng Shuyi, 

490
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,119
 what did you just do? 

491
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:12,199
 How could you? 

492
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,040
Iâ€¦

493
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,097
I'm going on a business trip in a couple of days.

494
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:33,540
Come with me. Okay?

495
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,645
I have to check my schedule.

496
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:43,819
I might be traveling, too.

497
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,440
Let me go home and check it real quick.

498
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:14,826
 Attention all passengers traveling to Ancheng. 

499
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,659
 This flight will begin boarding in 10 minutes. 

500
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,060
 Please proceed to Gate 23. 

501
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,340
You go back.

502
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,902
Mr. Fan has arrived in Ancheng. I'll ask him to pick you up.

503
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,627
Mr. Shi, what a coincidence.

504
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:14,099
What a coincidence. I'm going to Ancheng on business.

505
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,039
What's the matter?

506
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,720
Nothing.

507
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,279
Hello.

508
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:58,359
 - Why didn't you answer my calls?  
 - I'm on a business trip.

509
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:01,574
 That sudden? Does Shi Yan know about this? 

510
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,360
I'm on this trip with him.

511
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,939
With Shi Yan?

512
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,460
 Good for you! 

513
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,819
 But be careful. 

514
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:16,260
Enjoy it, but don't go there with two people and come as three people.

515
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,780
Got it. That's it.

516
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,939
Hello.

517
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:34,920
Hey, Shi Yan, did you land?

518
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,599
I've emailed you information on other battery companies.

519
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,180
Feel free to call me if there's anything you'd like to add.

520
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,580
Okay.

521
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,540
I'm traveling with Ms. Zheng.

522
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,160
She's sitting next to me right now.

523
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,440
Who are you talking to?

524
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,799
The one you talked about, the brilliant Professor Yu.

525
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:11,860
 Don't make it too easy for him. 

526
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,560
 Got it! 

527
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:22,741
You seem to have a knack for multi-tasking.

528
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:27,320
Chatting with Professor Yu while traveling with me.

529
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,797
You talk like you aren't checking Zhanlan and other battery companies at the same time.

530
00:41:31,797 --> 00:41:34,340
That makes us a perfect match.

531
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,719
Mr. Shi, the hotel is right in front of us.

532
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,400
Mr. Fan, please send me to the Kanglan Hotel.

533
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:12,140
Get out of the car.

534
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,839
What are you doing?

535
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,980
I'm going to take a taxi to my hotel.

536
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,519
This is your hotel.

537
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,179
Zhanlan is just around the corner, so I booked rooms here.

538
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:36,280
You're going to Zhanlan to interview them, so you're staying here with me.

539
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,299
I'm staying with you?

540
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,159
What's wrong?

541
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,159
Don't you want to?

542
