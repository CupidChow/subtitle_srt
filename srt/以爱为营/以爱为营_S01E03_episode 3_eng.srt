â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,600
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,800
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,200
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

15

â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
 Mr. Shi, the reporter from Financial Introduce has arrived. 

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
Isn't the appointment at 1:00?

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
 She arrived early. 

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
 - I will tell her to wait a while.  
 - Never mind.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,200
Bring her in.

26
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,800
Hello, Mr. Shi.

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
You areâ€¦

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm the reporter from the Financial Introduce, Xu Yuling.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,700
My colleague couldn't make it today,

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,800
so she asked me to conduct this interview.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,100
Thanks.

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,100
Let's begin.

33
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,700
Wait a minute, Ms. Xu.

34
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,900
Can I have a look at your outline?

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,300
Sure.

36
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:17,312
   

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,200
- Let's get started. 
 - Okay.

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Mingyu Cloud Innovation is a subsidiary of Mingyu Group.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,200
The most authoritative appraisal company has already given it an AA rating.

40
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,100
And thinking it was promising, it even raised the rating of the parent company.

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,400
The future of the company is undoubtedly promising.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,700
The topic of this interview mainly focuses on

43
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,000
the development plan and necessary preparation for the next five years.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And the role it plays in its parent company's glory, as well as other problems.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
First, I would like to ask Mr. Shi

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,200
to talk about the company's position when you established it.

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,900
That's a good registration.

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,600
Hello.

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Hi. I'm a reporter from the Financial Introduce.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Please register first.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Are all the reporters at your press this attractive?

52
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
 Xu Yuling. 

53
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,700
 Why is Xu Yuling's name on the register? 

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Thank you.

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Mr. Chen!

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,900
Ms. Zheng?

57
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,990
Today's interview with Mr. Shi, scheduled for 1:00 p.m.,

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
is proceeding as planned. Right?

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Wasn't there something wrong with you?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,400
Your colleague has already finished the interview.

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,800
She came during lunchtime when Mr. Shi happened to be available.

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,600
She also said that you entrusted her with the task.

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm sorry. We failed to communicate well.

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,600
Sorry for your wasted journey.

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
No worries.

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,100
Butâ€¦

67
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Mr. Shi! I scheduled the interview for this afternoon.

68
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,300
Mr. Shi is about to leave. Please go back.

69
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,000
The interview is over.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,100
I've been looking forward to this interview for a long time.

71
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,800
I waited for this day.

72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,400
Do you think itâ€™s convenient now?

73
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Mr. Shi, You have completed the basic part of the interview.

74
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,700
But there are five more questions about the company's future,

75
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,000
which remain unanswered.

76
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Just a little more of your time. Please.

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,600
What are the five questions?

78
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:47,895
Question 1.

79
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,000
As a subsidiary of Mingyu Group,

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,500
did the company ever operate independently from the parent company,

81
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,600
to expand into a larger market?

82
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Question 2.

83
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
In the future, the collaboration with Guan Capital

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,400
focuses on exploring investment in innovative and adventurous areas.

85
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
But is there any long-term plan?

86
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,400
Question 3.

87
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Professor Yu You has returned. Is that part of your plan?

88
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,700
This is your first personal interview,

89
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,000
and also the first step to expand the company's recognition.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Soâ€¦ I believe you will give the press and the public

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
a chance to know the company better. Am I right?

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Come here.

93
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,700
Mr. Shi, where are we going?

94
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,000
 Get my uncle on the phone. 

95
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,800
 Oh my gosh! That mistress! 

96
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,700
Tell her if she doesn't behave, she won't show up anymore.

97
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Miss Qin, you heard what Mr. Shi said.

98
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,700
 Quite commanding, huh? 

99
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,800
 Being so dignified, 

100
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,500
 why not teach your niece not to be a home-wrecker. 

101
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Mr. Shi, Mr. Fan is waiting for you in the commercial car.

102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,300
Let him come cover.

103
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Ms. Zheng might prefer to take this one.

104
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,800
Me?

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
I have a two-hour ride.

106
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
We can talk in the car.

107
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Didn't you say we can use the time in the car?

108
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,600
Certainly. No problem.

109
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
 We can even talk under the car. 

110
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,800
Mr. Shi.

111
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,800
 I can't believe I'm going to interview Shi Yan in this way. 

112
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,800
 Believe me. 

113
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
 However successful he is, he is a man. 

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,600
 And all men fall for this. 

115
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:51,153
 Shanshan's tactic doesn't work. 

116
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:57,153
Are you cold?

117
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,187
No.

118
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:05,059
Old Fan, open the window.

119
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,902
All right, Mr. Shi.

120
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:19,491
 I did say I'm not cold, 

121
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,896
 but that doesn't mean I'm hot. 

122
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,655
I'm on a tight schedule.

123
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:37,170
Mr. Shi, before we officially start, letâ€™s talk about something else for better communication.

124
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,970
Mr. Shi, before we officially start, letâ€™s talk about something else for better communication.

125
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,545
Fine. Talk about what?

126
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:45,035
You have rarely accepted interviews before.

127
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:49,592
Generally, we will get to know the interviewees before we start.

128
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,156
Then let's introduce ourselves.

129
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:53,420
Sorry?

130
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,284
Didn't you say we should get to know each other?

131
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,123
I'm Zheng Shuyi. A reporter from Financial Introduce.

132
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:02,814
I'm honored to interview you.

133
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:06,076
I'm Shi Yan, 27 years old. CEO of Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

134
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:09,278
 Why did I come up with this crazy idea? 

135
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,767
Mr. Shi is truly young and promising.

136
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,632
 The same cliche. 

137
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,050
Actually, the last time I went to Warner Manor to meet you,

138
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,360
I thought it was a stroke of luck.

139
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:26,442
I heard that Junior Guan of the Guans would come.

140
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,501
As you two are close, you would also attend.

141
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:34,180
Although you rarely attend such events, maybe I was lucky enough.

142
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,388
After all, the publication date is the deadline for us reporters.

143
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,357
It turns out I was really lucky.

144
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:42,282
Though I failed to interview you, I had the honor to meet you.

145
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:45,945
So, will the collaboration with the Guans be officially announced soon?

146
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:50,320
Next, are you entering areas of common interest?

147
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:08,730
Mr. Shi, did I say something wrong?

148
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:12,328
Why do you think Guan will cooperate with Cloud Innovation?

149
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:15,403
What do you think of Cloud Innovation and Guan Group?

150
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,614
Done with your questions?

151
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,428
Mr. Shi, I have one more.

152
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:07,927
What made you decide to leave Mingyu Group and start your own business?

153
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:11,059
Does your father support you?

154
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:19,048
 I'm getting older, 

155
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:23,281
 and many things are beyond my control. 

156
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,650
 For Mingyu to pull through this time, 

157
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,217
 I relied on on a bunch of old friends. 

158
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:31,285
 As for the future of Mingyu, 

159
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,401
 it is counting on you. 

160
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:37,052
 Brother-in-law is more suitable than me. 

161
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:39,697
 But you are a direct descendant. 

162
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:42,217
 What Mingyu needs is you. 

163
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,382
 My brother-in-law is also a part of the family. 

164
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:47,932
 I still want to do something I want to do, something meaningful. 

165
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,405
 How comeâ€¦ 

166
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:53,310
 Have you decided? 

167
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,770
 Yes. 

168
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,883
 The path may be way too challenging. 

169
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:00,829
 I know, 

170
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,037
 but someone has to leave. 

171
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:20,309
 I'm retiring soon, 

172
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:25,687
 and won't use that car anymore. 

173
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:27,674
 Take and drive it. 

174
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:30,736
 Thank you, Father. 

175
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:37,707
It's been two hours.

176
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,019
You can go back now.

177
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,918
 In this wilderness, how am I supposed to go back? 

178
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:18,013
 Am I supposed to ride a horse? 

179
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:21,466
 How can you harbor bitter resentment? 

180
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:25,154
 You want me to accept defeat in the wilderness? 

181
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:27,155
 Impossible! 

182
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:32,725
 As I came here by this car, I will go back by it. 

183
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:37,489
Mr. Shi, your voice sounds really nice.

184
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:41,643
Can I record some of the views to craft audio for our e-magazines?

185
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:47,129
As long as the integrity is ensured.

186
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,139
That means I am approved.

187
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:54,557
Wait a moment, Mr. Shi. I have one last question.

188
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,985
Go on.

189
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:59,821
Do you have a girlfriend?

190
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:16,948
This question isâ€¦ to fulfill our readers' curiosity.

191
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:20,553
If you really don't want to answer, that's fine, too.

192
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,879
Actually, my last question isâ€¦

193
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:27,348
Mingyu Cloud Innovation is such a young investment company and is determined to invest in Le'an Technology,

194
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:31,936
arenâ€™t you worried that the technology research and development cycle will be long and you wonâ€™t be able to get returns in the short term?

195
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:37,605
Is this question also to entertain readers' curiosity?

196
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:43,284
As a financial reporter,

197
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:47,206
this is my professional judgment based on myriad integrated information.

198
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:55,915
Shi Yan.

199
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
Who is this?

200
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:06,328
Mr. Guan!

201
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:09,806
It's nice to meet you. I am Zheng Shuyi from the Financial Introduce.

202
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,087
You know me?

203
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:15,868
I majored in Journalism at university, but I also minored in Finance.

204
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:19,162
During the first class of Finance, my teacher mentioned you.

205
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:22,657
And also, I work with you every day.

206
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,766
On the wall of my press, there lies the cover featuring you and Shi Wenguang.

207
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:30,703
Your name ran through my entire college life.

208
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,069
Your figure accompanies me every day and night of my work.

209
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,010
Your figure accompanies me every day and night of my work.

210
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,000
Although you seldom appear in public,

211
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:41,112
your prestige still stands like Mount Tai.

212
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,769
What's your name again?

213
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:48,205
Zheng Shuyi, right?

214
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:49,467
Yes.

215
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:52,307
Zheng Shuyi.

216
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,285
I have a bit of an impression of you.

217
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,109
I've read a few of your articles.

218
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,985
They are well-written, with depth and viewpoints.

219
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:05,689
I just didn't expect you to be a young lady.

220
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:07,716
You're flattering me.

221
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,992
I thought it was you coming alone again.

222
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:12,469
I haven't prepared anything.

223
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:14,646
Don't blame me for this, Miss Zheng.

224
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:18,726
He has never brought any young ladies here.

225
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:20,821
Actually, she isâ€¦

226
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:23,116
Oh my!

227
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:26,061
This place is so beautiful!

228
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,550
And so are these horses!

229
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:36,169
Mr. Guan, I heard that your favorite hobby is equestrianism.

230
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,265
You must have quite a few thoroughbreds.

231
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:40,823
Actually, the best horses are not here.

232
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:44,119
The best ones are inside.

233
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,529
There are more horses?

234
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:47,582
Do you want to take a look?

235
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:51,839
Shi Yan, show Miss Zheng around.

236
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,399
Come with me.

237
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:05,754
What's wrong? Do you have any problem?

238
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:09,063
It is Mr. Guan who invited me in.

239
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:18,951
Nothing to be afraid of.

240
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,283
Anyway, he won't make me feed the horses.

241
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:35,678
I am going to change.

242
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,572
I am waiting for you.

243
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,914
Is Shi Yan inside?

244
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,485
How long have you known him?

245
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,488
Not long.

246
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:57,142
But you are like him.

247
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:00,236
Can you ride?

248
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:01,859
I can't.

249
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,930
My wife's clothes are inside.

250
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,470
If you don't mind, you can get dressed.

251
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,497
Since you are here, why not give it a try?

252
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:13,195
Can I?

253
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,724
This way.

254
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,100
My wife has a similar figure with you.

255
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,068
The clothes should fit.

256
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:46,436
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

257
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,253
I'll be waiting for you outside.

258
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,447
It's silent.

259
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,413
Maybe he has already gone.

260
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:00,962
Mr. Shi!

261
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:07,613
I don't know how to fasten the belt, can you show me how, please?

262
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,713
â™«  Not accidentally  â™«

263
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,988
â™«  It's not just a coincidence  â™«

264
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:24,845
â™«  It's not just to hear the words "I'm sorry"  â™«

265
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:28,892
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

266
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:33,645
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

267
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:43,181
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

268
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:48,028
â™«  If love is like a cloud  â™«

269
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:51,846
â™«  Always erratic  â™«

270
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:56,378
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

271
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:59,827
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

272
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:03,112
â™«  I will also be cautious  â™«

273
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:05,190
â™«  I will also be breathless  â™«

274
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,987
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

275
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:14,496
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

276
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,445
 She tries to tease me. 

277
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,290
â™«  The unresolved clouds  â™«

278
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,170
If you don't know how to fasten it, don't ride.

279
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,370
â™«  If you can't hold onto luck, take a deep breath  â™«

280
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,298
Marquez once said that

281
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:37,424
when a woman wants to pursue a man,

282
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:40,633
there is no wall she can't overcome, no fortress she can't topple,

283
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:41,901
and no concern she can't cast aside.

284
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:44,064
There's even no God that can control her.

285
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:46,549
What I face now, is it an impenetrable barrier?

286
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:48,966
Or a trial by fire? Or the wrath of God?

287
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,306
It's none of the above.

288
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:53,060
It's just a small rejection.

289
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:57,244
Zheng Shuyi, you can do it. Cross over it.

290
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:41,988
This horse is the gentlest of them all.

291
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:43,846
Let Shi Yan teach you.

292
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:45,488
Come over.

293
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,049
Be careful.

294
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:56,717
What a tall and handsome little prince.

295
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,503
Doudou is a mare.

296
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,106
Doudou is a little princess!

297
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,785
You are so cute. And docile.

298
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:12,828
Seems you liked me... at first sight.

299
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:20,441
Then, please teach me how to ride a horse.

300
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:23,585
Please.

301
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:36,127
Then I'll trouble you to lead the horse for me.

302
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:54,576
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

303
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,944
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

304
00:26:56,944 --> 00:27:00,865
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

305
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:03,574
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

306
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:08,195
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

307
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:10,689
This way, I can teach you how to ride.

308
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:12,799
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

309
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,459
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

310
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,406
Relax. Learn seriously.

311
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,090
Oh...

312
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,010
This is my first time riding. Feeling a bit nervous.

313
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,807
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

314
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:30,886
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

315
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:35,314
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

316
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:38,625
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

317
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:42,335
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

318
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:48,240
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

319
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:10,053
Sit steadily.

320
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:11,638
What?

321
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:17,899
Slow down! Show down!

322
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,167
What's wrong? Don't want to study anymore?

323
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:50,024
No, I justâ€¦ just want to experience it.

324
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:10,066
Doudou is the gentlest horse in the whole stable.

325
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,060
And it's the closest to you.

326
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:15,102
I asked you to teach the lady.

327
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:18,058
Why scare her?

328
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:21,739
She's quite bold. She won't be scared.

329
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,978
Earlier when I asked you to relax here,

330
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,895
you said you were too busy to come.

331
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:27,564
How come you are free today?

332
00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:29,538
And even brought Miss Zheng?

333
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:37,752
Just on a whim.

334
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:39,516
She is interesting.

335
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:42,029
She looks just like your type.

336
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:45,102
Really?

337
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:46,771
It doesn't matter right now.

338
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:50,482
Not now. Things can develop gradually.

339
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:54,718
So bumpy.

340
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:57,411
I donâ€™t know if it was intentional or not.

341
00:29:57,411 --> 00:30:00,568
He even teases me in front of Mr. Guan.

342
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:02,650
So inhumane.

343
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:04,985
Marquez may be wrong.

344
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:08,119
At least I can't even get over this saddle.

345
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,658
I'm out.

346
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:17,247
You are right. Many things may be nothing at first.

347
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:21,028
But as they develop, there can be loads of possibilities.

348
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,767
You meanâ€¦ Le'an Technology.

349
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,679
I mean everything.

350
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,052
The same goes for Cloud Innovation.

351
00:30:31,983 --> 00:30:34,892
I heard something from Guan Ji.

352
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:37,461
I was concerned at first.

353
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,961
Now it seems I was over-thinking.

354
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,506
Shi Yan, the path you're about to take,

355
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:47,275
is long and challenging.

356
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:52,106
Mingyu has just survived a crisis, and you started Cloud Innovation.

357
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:54,065
At this critical juncture,

358
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:57,188
Mr. Tian first extended help to Mingyu, and then to you.

359
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,508
Remember all of this.

360
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:04,544
During this stage, it's important to stay stable.

361
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:06,764
Why upset Mr. Tian and others unnecessarily?

362
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,449
If they're unhappy, it will bring you trouble.

363
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:14,928
I know. So I need to be better.

364
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:19,471
As long as I make the right decisions, all the dissatisfaction will be temporary.

365
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:26,393
As for Lieying, I've heard something.

366
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:31,969
To some extent, it is a good choice for you to invest in them.

367
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:34,889
Once the Guans inject their capital,

368
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:37,962
you can invest in both.

369
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,379
It's unnecessary to be so tense.

370
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:41,278
They are old friends of your father.

371
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,165
Don't stay in their way.

372
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:48,205
Uncle Guan, I understand.

373
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,453
But Cloud Innovation is young.

374
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:54,385
I hope it can be pure and concentrate on one thing,

375
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:59,990
instead of changing the original course just to satisfy others.

376
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:04,452
That crisis made me clear

377
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:09,400
that a modern enterprise needs professional and pure management.

378
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:13,923
Is Little Yue back now?

379
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:15,663
What has she been busy with lately?

380
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,575
She returned a few days ago,

381
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:21,062
but she's been idle all day, wasting her life.

382
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:25,036
I am just thinking of finding her a job to train her.

383
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,259
As you mentioned earlier,

384
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:31,422
some people might be nobody initially,

385
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:34,598
but there will be many possibilities as they develop.

386
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:37,368
Little Yue is clever.

387
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:41,195
If fostered, she can be somebody.

388
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:42,677
Maybe you're right.

389
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:47,048
It's just I don't know where to begin.

390
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,051
How about letting her in the Guans?

391
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:53,795
To Guan Ji's company?

392
00:32:53,795 --> 00:32:56,099
Then we'll see who is working.

393
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,773
You know Guan Ji always indulges her.

394
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:03,255
Right.

395
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:04,862
If you really want to train her,

396
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:08,100
send her to a totally unfamiliar place.

397
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,655
Typically, is a typical example of being incompetent in writing and incompetent in martial arts.

398
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:13,658
Which company would want her?

399
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,496
Would you invite her to be a mascot?

400
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,677
Don't say that about her.

401
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:21,407
Little Yue is smart, cheerful,

402
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:23,652
and has high emotional intelligence.

403
00:33:24,274 --> 00:33:27,781
You can consider letting her be a reporter.

404
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:31,590
I remember she studied media overseas, and her major aligns perfectly.

405
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:34,721
Reporter?

406
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,200
Like her?

407
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,161
Then, what do you think a report should be?

408
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:04,688
You are the Chinese Oscar statue. Right?

409
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:09,743
You look like you're not the one who just did that thing.

410
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,722
Maybe we can give her a try.

411
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,242
Let her try.

412
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:24,932
I have a reporter friend who can help.

413
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:28,756
Uncle Guan, are you familiar with reporters?

414
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:31,846
The reporters are familiar with me.

415
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,539
Don't look at me again.

416
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:39,064
You just want to see me embarrass myself.

417
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:40,790
Fine, just go ahead.

418
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,552
But don't expect to see me again.

419
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,598
Where is Chen Sheng?

420
00:34:54,598 --> 00:34:59,338
He said something urgent happened and went to the company to handle that.

421
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:02,544
First, take Ms. Zheng back.

422
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:04,138
All right.

423
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:14,190
 Doesn't he get hungry? 

424
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,622
 After a two-hour interview and one hour of riding, 

425
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:23,056
 how can he not even have a sense of entertaining guest? 

426
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:26,593
 Maybe I can invite him instead. 

427
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:39,467
 Whileâ€¦ he is so charming during work. 

428
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,766
I'm sorry, but where is Mr. Shi?

429
00:36:57,766 --> 00:37:00,834
He left earlier.

430
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,819
 Mr. Fan, I will leave first. 

431
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:06,893
 You send her home. 

432
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:12,499
 When she wakes up, ask her what she needs. 

433
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,162
 Make sure she goes home safely. 

434
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:15,945
 All right, Mr. Shi. 

435
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:21,121
No need, thanks.

436
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:25,816
 What a strange way of hospitality. 

437
00:37:25,816 --> 00:37:28,474
 Thoughtful yet impatient. 

438
00:37:28,474 --> 00:37:32,495
 Leave me alone with the car. 

439
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:44,019
How come I fell asleep in the car,

440
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:46,947
while the interviewee was Shi Yan.

441
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:49,365
It never happened before.

442
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:52,087
So unprofessional.

443
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:56,782
As I slept soundly, who knows if there was anything wrong.

444
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:07,722
Anyway. The pair of earrings were just 25 yuan.

445
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:10,882
Consider it a gift for teaching me.

446
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,770
   

447
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,680
Mr. Shi, I appreciate your coming to expound with me when it is so late.

448
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,604
I'm really grateful.

449
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:30,387
But something is beyond my control.

450
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:33,074
After all, Le'an is not mine alone.

451
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:35,829
I cannot just count myself in.

452
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:37,307
I understand you.

453
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:38,537
What Lieying can offer you, Innovation can definitely provide you too.

454
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:40,084
What Lieying can offer you, Innovation can definitely provide you too.

455
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,311
You should understand.

456
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,930
It is precisely because of Cloud Innovations's sincerity towards Le'an

457
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,794
that Lieying gave Le'an a purchase price of 50 million.

458
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,148
I understand.

459
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:53,899
But 50 million is indeed too attractive to Le'an at this stage.

460
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:58,459
Mr. Chen, you should also know that Lieying is still seeking investment from us.

461
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:02,359
Not to mention whether he has sufficient funds to realize this acquisition.

462
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:07,117
In the long run, you should not be bound by an integrated company at this stage.

463
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:10,016
Cloud Innovation wants to create Chinese chips with Le'an,

464
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:14,971
so what suits you most is financing rather than being acquired.

465
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:18,445
Mr. Shi, you are a good judge of talent,

466
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:21,364
but we have been in contact with Cloud Innovations for some time,

467
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:23,034
with no progress in our collaboration.

468
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:24,492
Our team urgently needs funds to overcome challenges.

469
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:26,236
Our team urgently needs funds to overcome challenges.

470
00:39:26,236 --> 00:39:28,916
I really can't explain it to the team.

471
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:33,919
Give me some time. I will push forward relevant matters.

472
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,349
Let's solve these problems together.

473
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,430
 My legs are sore from the saddle. 

474
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,735
 For the sake of an article, my whole body is falling apart. 

475
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:11,772
 It's really not easy. 

476
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,776
 Let's go get a massage. 

477
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:25,905
 I'm not going. Have to meet the deadline. 

478
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,800
â™«  Every passing scene is all related to you  â™«

479
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:37,818
â™«  My heart harbors no regret  â™«

480
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:46,133
â™«  Amidst countless wonders  â™«

481
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:54,010
â™«  I never look back  â™«

482
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:57,480
â™«  Raindrops dance on eaves  â™«

483

â™«  There you are, amidst dimming lights  â™«

485
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:16,347
â™«  I am destined to be with you  â™«

486

â™«  Love rings are exchanged on the ring fingers  â™«

487

â™«  I wish there were no partings in this world  â™«

490
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:46,377
A good article. Nice job.

491
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:48,836
Not hard. It was enjoyable to write.

492
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:52,693
What's up? Anything else?

493
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:57,117
Sister Yi, I do have some thoughts.

494
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:00,232
This interview with Shi Yan had many innovative viewpoints.

495
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:02,611
It might attract many young readers.

496
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:04,338
But he always keeps a low-profile.

497
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:06,790
So, many people are curious about him.

498
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,661
So, I want to put Shi Yan's audio on the e-magazine.

499
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:16,306
It's a good idea,

500
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:19,918
but upgrading to an e-magazine is not a simple task.

501
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:21,501
It requires a lot of efforts and money.

502
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:25,486
For example, who is to produce the audio you just mentioned?

503
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:27,233
I know.

504
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:30,467
So we must keep pace with readers' reading and consumption habits.

505
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:34,197
We should even lead readers forward so that we can generate more revenue and upgrade the e-magazine.

506
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:36,896
After upgrading the magazine we can provide it in diverse forms.

507
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:40,856
It can also enhance readers' reading experience, and interact effectively with readers,

508
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:43,253
so they are willing to pay for the content.

509
00:42:43,253 --> 00:42:47,513
Once we generate revenue, we can smoothly upgrade and revamp.

510
00:42:47,513 --> 00:42:49,646
As for audio production,

511
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:54,121
I've learned a little online before, so I can manage for now.

512
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:56,964
You are really persistent.

513
00:42:56,964 --> 00:42:59,155
I need to ask the chief editor first.

514
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:01,622
I hope you can at least have a try.

515
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,360
Thanks, Ms Yi.
