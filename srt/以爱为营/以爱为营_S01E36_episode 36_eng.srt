 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,700
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,800
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,400
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,000
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,400
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,600
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,100
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,200
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,800
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,600
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,000
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,600
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,000
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,000
   

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600
   

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,600
 Cloud Innovation, the investor behind Le'an, faces questioning. 

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,900
Mr. Shi, some media outlets invited you to talk about

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,000
what you think of the collaboration between Le'an and Black Horse.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Turn them down.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,900
   

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Yes, this is the report.

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,100
I'll take a call.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
Ms. Zheng, are you looking for Mr. Shi?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
 Mr. Shi is in the office. You can call him directly. 

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,600
No. I'm looking for you.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,000
 I want to schedule an interview with Mr. Shi. 

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
Is it about Le'an Tech and Dark Horse?

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
 Ms. Zheng, 

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,600
 Mr. Shi asked me to decline all media interviews. 

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,800
 Since you're making this call, Mr. Shi probably hasn't explained it to you in detail. 

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,000
This matter involves not just Cloud Innovation.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,500
 This is the critical moment of Le'an and Dark Horse's collaboration. 

39
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,600
 Mr. Shi doesn't want to put both companies in the spotlight. 

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,000
This can affect their collaboration.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,900
Soâ€¦ he is willing to bear it all himself.

42
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,400
 Ms. Zheng, I know you're also doing your job. 

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,900
 Butâ€¦ Mr. Shi has his considerations and decisions. 

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm homeâ€¦

45
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,800
Shuyi.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,300
What are you looking at?

47
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,600
When did you come back?

48
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,800
Are you worried about something?

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
No, not really.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why?

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,900
If you don't tell me, I'll check myself.

52
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,200
Anyway, we don't have secrets anymore.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,100
I called Chen Sheng today.

54
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,200
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

55
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,000
You don't want to face the media.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But some things can still be made clear.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Words can convey attitudes.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,500
Readers are not fools.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,900
You shouldn't bear all this alone. Okay?

60
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,800
I'm not against media interviews.

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
I just don't want to provoke more controversy at this stage.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No matter what I say now, it will not be of substantial help to their R&amp;D.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Instead, it could fuel public doubt.

64
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,200
If Le'an really makes a breakthrough this time.

65
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,000
Investors will know the decision was right.

66
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,200
Shuyi, do you understand me?

67
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
I do.

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I can hold off the interview.

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,900
Butâ€¦ when you return home,

70
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,500
if you have anything you'd like to talk about,

71
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,600
let me share the burden and be by your side.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Sit.

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,000
I want to talk to you about Cloud Innovation.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,100
Sister Yi, I came to talk about the same thing.

75
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Regarding Cloud Innovation's recent problem, I think we should observe before following up.

76
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,500
Shuyi,

77
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,000
I hope you're saying this not because Shi Yan is your boyfriend.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
Work is work. Life is life.

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm not mixing them up.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
I have my own considerations.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
The two companies have just started collaborating.

82
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,300
They've made no substantial progress yet.

83
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,000
What should I write?

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Emotional and intuitive writing isn't our magazine's style, nor mine.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,500
We must base our work on facts, conduct objective analysis, and express viewpoints.

86
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,600
That makes a lot of sense.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,000
It seems whatever I say won't change your mind.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Yes.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,000
Because I've already checked with the interviewee.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,310
I believe emotions and careers can coexist peacefully.

91
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,200
There could even be a win-win.

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Is that so?

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
Then show me an example.

94
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,000
No problem. Thank you, Sister Yi.

95
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,570
   

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
That's a bit too harsh.

97
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,100
Yeah.

98
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,500
They're just assembling bits and pieces to make an article.

99
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,800
These people don't care about the truth anymore, do they?

100
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,800
They're gaining traffic by mentioning Cloud Innovation and slandering Shi Yan.

101
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Look at this.

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,900
I believe everyone's been following the news about Cloud Innovation, Le'an, and Dark Horse.

103
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,200
We've also done a feature on Cloud Innovation before.

104
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,800
And interviewed the founders of Le'an Tech and Dark Horse.

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,700
We have to follow up on the story.

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,400
Who will be in charge?

107
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
This is a great opportunity.

108
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,200
Everyone should take the initiative.

109
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,000
Be brave and daring.

110
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Sister Yi, I want to follow up on this interview.

111
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Whyâ€¦

112
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,900
I respect the interviewee's wishes, but I also have my stance as a journalist.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,600
 As an investor in Le'an Tech, the CEO of Cloud Innovation understands the situation. 

114
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
 In terms of technology. 

115
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,200
 Le'an's mature team and production line are beyond Dark Horse's reach. 

116
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,700
 But Dark Horse has critical technology experts like Bruce. 

117
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,300
 Both companies have their clear strengths and weaknesses. 

118
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,600
 You can't say one is stronger than the other. 

119
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,900
 Le'an may seem to be hitting a dead end. 

120
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,400
 It chose to collaborate with Dark Horse because it understands the situation clearly. 

121
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,200
 It's seeing the whole picture, and is actively seeking a breakthrough. 

122
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
 Dark Horse is a rising star in the industry. 

123
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 On its own, it might not be able to solve its technical challenges. 

124
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 Collaborating with experienced Le'an is a win-win choice. 

125
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
   

126
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 This interview is very detailed and informative. 

127
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,100
 I also think the collaboration between the two companies is the best option. 

128
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,600
 I've been following Ms. Zheng's feature reports about Cloud Innovation. 

129
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
 I really like her writing style. 

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
 The article is objective and her opinion is sharp. 

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,600
 I hope Ms. Zheng will follow up on the collaboration between Le'an and Dark Horse. 

132
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
 Shi Yan is quite something. 

133
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,800
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

134
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

135
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,200
You're back.

136
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Making soup for me?

137
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,500
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

138
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,000
Thank you.

139
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,400
What for?

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,700
I just want to thank you.

141
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,600
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

142
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Then how are you going to thank me?

143
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,800
How about an interview themed "Five Questions with Shi Yan" mentioned in your article?

144
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,300
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

145
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

146
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,200
Good. Really good.

147
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,400
Mr. Tian. Mr. Zhang.

148
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,800
Shi Yan, we were just talking about you.

149
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,900
Come, sit.

150
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,400
Sit.

151
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
Do you know what we're reading?

152
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
We're reading the comments under your interview.

153
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,400
In these comments, people have greatly changed their views of you and Cloud Innovation.

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,300
Now the industry is very optimistic about the collaboration between Le'an and Dark Horse.

155
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,200
I originally thought you were abandoning the essentials for minor details.

156
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,500
Yet you actually borrowed other people's strengths to turn the tide.

157
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,100
We really can't keep up with the younger generation anymore.

158
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,200
From now on, this is the world of you youngsters.

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Yes.

160
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Your criticism is also very meaningful to me.

161
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,400
I hope I haven't disappointed both of you and the shareholders of Cloud Innovation.

162
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,700
Don't say that!

163
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,000
Your father would be proud of you, too.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Feifei used to tell me all the time that Shi Yan has new ideas and vision.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
She told me not to worry so much and that I should rest assured.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,300
Now it seems I really was over-thinking.

167
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,500
Shi Yan, you've truly grown up.

168
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,200
The integrated media team has already taken shape and has its own operation mode.

169
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
Next, we need to accelerate the expansion of the integrated media business.

170
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,500
We will build a more complete organizational structure.

171
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,200
This task will first be entrusted to Zheng Shuyi.

172
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
I've already discussed it with the lead editor.

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
We'll prioritize our current employees.

174
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,420
If anyone is interested in joining the integrated media project,

175
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,600
you can talk to Shuyi.

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,400
Do you have any other questions?

177
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,300
 No. 

178
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,800
That's all.

179
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,900
- Let's go. 
 - Come over here.

180
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,800
Not now. I'm not ready yet.

181
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,200
Go, hurry up.

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,700
Hurry up. Hurry up.

183
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,500
What are you two doing?

184
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,600
Sister Shuyi, Beier has something to say to you.

185
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,800
What is it, Beier?

186
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Sister Shuyi,

187
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
well, I was thinkingâ€¦

188
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,900
Uhâ€¦ Wellâ€¦

189
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,200
She wants to join our integrated media team.

190
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
Uhâ€¦

191
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Really?

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,900
You've thought it through?

193
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,600
Actually, I've thought about it for a long time.

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Uhâ€¦

195
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Before today, it was becauseâ€¦

196
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,000
Sister Shuyi,

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,400
I really want to learn from you how to become an excellent financial journalist.

198
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,700
I mean it.

199
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm very strict.

200
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,900
Ask Shiyue if you don't believe me.

201
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,700
I know. That's why I want you to be strict with me.

202
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,000
This way I can improve.

203
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,900
Okay. Let me think about it.

204
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
I've thought about it.

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,300
I need to assign more work to you and Shiyue.

206
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Thank you, Shuyi.

207
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,000
Everyone, let me introduce our new intern, Hu Qinghua.

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,600
Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone.

209
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm the new integrated media editor.

210
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
Nice to meet you all.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You can sit over there. I'll be leaving now.

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
Okay. Thank you, Youran.

213
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,000
No problem.

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

215
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,800
Hello, I'm Hu Qinghua.

216
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,900
I know.

217
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,200
Hello, I'm Cheng Beier.

218
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
How did you know my name?

219
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Did youâ€¦ just say it yourself?

220
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,400
Oh, yes.

221
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:54,000
   

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
Keep it up.

223
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,900
Go for it, my little auntie. Head of the integrated media group.

224
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
You're the best.

225
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,600
Congratulations, Director Zheng.

226
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
The process isn't over yet. Don't call me that.

227
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,400
People will laugh at me.

228
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
It's already a done deal.

229
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Sister Shuyi, I've already set your equipment up for you.

230
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
Just let me know if you have any problems.

231
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
- Thank you. 
 - Good luck.

232
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,400
â™«  Waiting on the station platform of time  â™«

233
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,200
Hello, lead editor. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

234
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,300
Don't be nervous. Just act as usual.

235
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,700
You're good.

236
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,600
â™«  ...the wonderful things arranged by fate  â™«

237
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
The integrated media group has been established for a while now.

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Our e-magazine is thriving thanks to Zheng Shuyi's efforts and persistence.

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
As the integrated media team gets on the right track.

240
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,200
Financial Introduce is full of confidence for the future development and layout.

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,800
So what we're going to discuss is the candidate for the head of the integrated media team.

242
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,000
First, Zheng Shuyi will give a performance report.

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,800
â™«  Intrude my life  â™«

244
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,600
â™«  You are like the moon in a deep night  â™«

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
â™«  You are like the sun in the blue sky  â™«

246
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,200
Founding the integrated media e-magazine was an unreachable dream in the eyes of many.

247
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,600
But with the support of you all and the efforts of me and my colleagues,

248
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,200
this dream has become a reality.

249
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,600
And I can confidently say that Financial Introduce's e-magazine is engaging and fun.

250
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,800
In the future, we can do even better.

251
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,400
â™«  I'm glad to have never left   â™«

252
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
News is perishable.

253
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,100
But the people, stories, and meanings can resonate with people's hearts for a long time.

254
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
I hope I can have the opportunity to lead our integrated media team.

255
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,200
Together, we'll stay true to our original aspiration and grow as time elapses.

256
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,300
â™«  Intrude my life  â™«

257
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,000
â™«  You are like the moon in a deep night  â™«

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Shuyi, we haven't seen each other for a long time.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,400
Yes, lead editor.

260
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,800
I heard some rumors.

261
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,700
They say you got so many resources and opportunities because of your boyfriend.

262
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,800
A reporter should indeed hold various resources to meet work needs.

263
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,500
My boyfriend, Shi Yan, is very outstanding.

264
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,400
And he's very supportive of my work.

265
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,800
So, indeed, he has given me a lot of resources and help.

266
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,000
But my resources and opportunities are not just Shi Yan.

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,200
In places unseen by others, we help each other.

268
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,600
â€‹â™«  You will also gain love  â™«

269
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
That's it?

270
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,300
- How was it? 
 - How was it?

271
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,500
Not bad. I performed as usual.

272
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Treat! It's on you!

273
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,600
Okay, okay!

274
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Tomorrow night. You choose the restaurant.

275
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
- Thank you, Sister Shuyi. 
 - Thank you, Sister Shuyi.

276
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
 I'll treat you to dinner tonight. 

277
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,200
 Pick whatever restaurant you want. 

278
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
 Don't be polite with "Leader Zheng". 

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
 Bogang Cloudy Bay. Is that okay? 

280
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Sure. I will cook for you personally.

281
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,714
   

282
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,300
You can say it, Sister Yi.

283
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,200
So, in the end, the lead editor didn't agree. Right?

284
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,000
Shuyi, the lead editor isn't denying you.

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
He just thinks you're too young.

286
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,900
He thinks you don't have enough management experience.

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,700
I understand.

288
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,200
The lead editor praised you all day today.

289
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,000
It's just that he doesn't know you well enough.

290
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Financial Introduce just created such an important team.

291
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,400
And now we're appointing such a young group leader.

292
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Of course, he has many concerns.

293
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,800
But he told me he hasn't seen anyone better than you.

294
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
Shuyi.

295
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,800
Actually, I also have my own selfish reasons.

296
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,400
I hope you'll stay on the front line for a few more years.

297
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
This way, you can produce more good articles.

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
I get it.

299
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,600
If that's the reason, I completely accept it.

300
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,800
Hello. Do you have WeChat?

301
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Hello. Do you have WeChat?

302
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,200
Why do you want his WeChat?

303
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,900
I just want to transfer him some money.

304
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,400
I'm so miserable.

305
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,900
You're getting another man's WeChat.

306
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,100
I don't think you're that miserable.

307
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Can't you say something nicer?

308
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,000
 This is a public place. 

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,900
 Has Shi Yan been possessed? 

310
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,300
What are you doing? People are watching.

311
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Don't you like it this way?

312
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
I didn't become the group leader today.

313
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,800
The lead editor didn't agree.

314
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,300
Then I need to introduce an eye doctor to your lead editor.

315
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Then hurry up.

316
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

317
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,200
Let's go. Go, go, go.

318
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,500
What about your promised luxurious banquet?

319
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,200
Still missing a variety of plates.

320
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
Zheng Shuyi.

321
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm so miserable.

322
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,900
I wasn't promoted. And my boyfriend is mean.

323
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,200
What's the point of living?

324
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,100
â™«  Unyielding and stubborn mouth  â™«

325
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,700
â™«  No sooner or later, waiting for a hug  â™«

326
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,300
â™«  Unknowingly  â™«

327
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,600
What are you trying to do now?

328
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,600
â™«  I have become familiar with your taste  â™«

329
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,000
â™«  Neither cold nor hot, relying on a constant warmth  â™«

330
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,700
This is the limited edition (shi yan) when Zheng Shuyi is unhappy.

331
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,600
I don't know if I'll get another chance to see it.

332
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
I have to take a picture.

333
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,200
â™«  Not too close, not too far. The distance is just right  â™«

334
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,200
â™«  Don't say it was just a coincidence because of the weather  â™«

335
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,800
â™«  That your heartbeat was so panicked that you threw off your guard  â™«

336
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
â™«  Baby, don't make any noise  â™«

337
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Are you still feeling down?

338
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,400
â™«  Just hold my hands tightly  â™«

339
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
All right then.

340
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,400
Although I didn't succeed in getting promoted, I got your limited-edition picture.

341
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,500
This is also an achievement.

342
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
You've made more achievements with men than that.

343
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Shi Yan,

344
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,000
you do get jealous easily.

345
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,400
Yue Xingzhou was fired for negligence at work.

346
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Qin Lezhi was also fired by Qiu Fu.

347
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,700
â™«  I just want to say  â™«

348
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,800
I didn't expect to be such a beautiful jinx!

349
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,300
â™«  Even if you're elusive  â™«

350
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,300
â™«  You're never far away  â™«

351
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
No laughing!

352
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,000
â™«  The warmth you give  â™«

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,100
Itchy!

354
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,400
â™«  ...spreads throughout the four seasons  â™«

355
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:16,000
â™«  Let the warm air of love transform into raindrops  â™«

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,700
Shuyi, come have breakfast.

357
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,100
I'll skip it. I'm late.

358
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 Sister Shuyi, did you have breakfast? 

359
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
 I bought you pan-fried buns. It's from the stall on Xu Fu Road. 

360
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,900
 You said yesterday that there's always a long queue before the store. 

361
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
Thank you, Qinghua. No need.

362
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
I've eaten at home.

363
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,200
 Then, Sister Shuyi, do you know what Beier likes to eat? 

364
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,300
 I'll bring her some, too. 

365
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,200
I haven't seen her eat pan-fried buns for breakfast.

366
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,600
She buys coffee every morning.

367
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,400
 Got it. Thank you, Sister Shuyi. 

368
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
 I'll treat you to a meal sometime. 

369
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
Who is he?

370
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,500
Our agency's new integrated media editor.

371
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
He's quite considerate.

372
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,000
What's the use of that?

373
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,200
No matter how considerate he is, it's nothing compared to my love for my hubby.

374
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
My heart only has a place for my hubby.

375
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,000
Besides, he was really calling for Cheng Beier.

376
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,480
- What are you doing? 
 - I forgot something.

377
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,020
What do you need this for?

378
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,220
I think my office is a bit empty. I want to add something to it.

379
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,980
Do you think I should put it on the desk or the reception table?

380
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,280
Or should I just hang it at the office door?

381
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,799
Whatever you want.

382
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,759
I'm leaving.

383
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,640
Take your time.

384
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,000
This is your sandwich.

385
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,780
And this is the coffee I bought for you.

386
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:03,057
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

387
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:06,637
â™«  It's your shining eyes that light up my universe  â™«

388
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:11,953
â™«  It's your shining eyes that light up my universe  â™«

389
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:17,575
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

390
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:20,527
â™«  Luckily, you didn't go far away  â™«

391
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:27,120
â™«  I can still tightly hold your hand  â™«

392
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:34,584
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

393
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:36,125
Do you need help?

394
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,240
No need.

395
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,939
Go sit down and rest. It'll be ready soon.

396
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,252
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

397
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:56,071
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

398
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,540
Is it that delicious?

399
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,640
Are you not having lunch later?

400
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,719
What is delicious isn't the pan-fried buns. It's my husband's thoughtfulness that is delicious.

401
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:09,028
I definitely won't miss one.

402
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,899
Later, you'd better finish all the dishes.

403
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:14,420
Because that's also your husband's thoughtfulness.

404
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:24,235
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™« 
    

405
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:30,361
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

406
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:36,261
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

407
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:43,346
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

408
00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:46,474
â™«  Blooming roses, gorgeous yet wither  â™«

409
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:49,490
â™«  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

410
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,380
â™«  Roses reveal a hidden ambiguity  â™«

411
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,410
It's snowing.

412
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,140
It's snowing.

413
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,375
â™«  Roses are the most powerful and most beautiful  â™«

414
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:06,273
â™«  Roses carve fearlessness with their domination  â™«

415
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,599
â™«  Blooming roses  â™«

416
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,340
It's the first snow this year.

417
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,880
â™«  Carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

418
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,740
You like snow that much?

419
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,160
Haven't you heard about it?

420
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,100
They say people who get together on the first snow will love each other forever.

421
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,376
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

422
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:30,334
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

423
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,368
Then we can be together forever.

424
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,422
â™«  Blooming roses, gorgeous yet wither  â™«

425
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:49,500
â™«  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

426
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,920
â™«  Roses reveal a hidden ambiguity  â™«

427
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,404
â™«  Roses are the most dangerous yet noble  â™«

428
00:26:58,404 --> 00:27:01,562
â™«  Roses are the most powerful and most beautiful  â™«

429
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:06,395
â™«  Roses carve fearlessness with their domination  â™«

430
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:12,129
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

431
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:20,065
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

432
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,519
Shiyue, follow up on this.

433
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,200
Okay, Sister Shuyi.

434
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,100
Right now.

435
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:49,170
   

436
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,580
I got the offer!

437
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,920
Congratulations, Shiyue. You got accepted.

438
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,000
Hope you keep it up and become an excellent financial journalist.

439
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,999
I definitely will.

440
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,200
When Bruce left Le'an Tech, it was unpleasant.

441
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,859
Now they have to work side by side.

442
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,000
I worried that they would feel awkward to begin with.

443
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,039
But things went swimmingly. What a surprise.

444
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,100
In fact, their goals are aligned.

445
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,330
They respect each other in terms of technology.

446
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,780
And there's a foundation for collaboration.

447
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,419
I have to say your judgment is accurate again.

448
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:27,720
Drink.

449
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,200
It was in your plan all along, huh?

450
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,899
Drink up.

451
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,699
Let me open the door.

452
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,939
Just a moment.

453
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,840
Yu You!

454
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,359
Shiyue.

455
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,340
I'm so happy.

456
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,519
Why don't you ask me why?

457
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,839
I got an offer today.

458
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:02,359
And my first headline plan for the e-magazine was approved.

459
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,060
Really?

460
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,340
Quick, think about how you're going to reward me.

461
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,400
Qin Shiyue.

462
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,780
Don't be afraid.

463
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,219
Just call me "uncle."

464
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,599
 According to the latest report by Financial Introduce, 

465
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:13,200
 Le'an and Dark Horse have made big breakthroughs in millimeter-wave chips. 

466
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,059
 This breakthrough is likely to elevate domestic chips to new heights. 

467
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,141
   

468
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,817
   

469
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:36,360
As the aging issue progresses,

470
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,960
elderly care becomes an issue that everyone must face. 
    

471
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,333
Major financiers are entering the huge market.

472
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,300
Competition is becoming fiercer.

473
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,200
She focuses on people's livelihood through her writing.

474
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,160
She cares about and focuses on this issue, conducting in-depth research.

475
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,039
She explores the future of intelligent elderly care.

476
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:56,459
She's demonstrated the social responsibility of young media professionals.

For the 10th Financial News Award, under the Annual Industry Report category.

478
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,559

479
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,079
The winner is reporter from Financial Introduce.

480
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,419
Zheng Shuyi.

481
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,000
   

482
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,580
Thank you, everyone.

483
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:46,510
   

484
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,270
 Le'an Technology 7th Anniversary] 

485
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,280
Hello, everyone.

486
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,419
First of all, thank you for coming.

487
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,430
Those present today are friends

488
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,559
who have been helping Le'an to this day.

489
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm not a good speaker, so allow me to bow to you first.

490
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,920
In the blink of an eye, Le'an Technology has been around for seven years.

491
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,739
Along the way, there have been hardships.

492
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,559
But for me, I've learned more.

493
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,219
You've really got good vision.

494
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,620
My vision has always been good.

495
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,880
They all say good things can't last for over seven years.

496
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,760
But I assure you,

497
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,720
Le'an, on its seventh anniversary, will keep striving forward.

498
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,179
So today, I want to share with you some good news.

499
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:50,700
 What good news? 

500
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,620
 What good news? 

501
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,400
Le'an Tech will be aiming for its IPO  (initial public offering). 

502
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,319
 Great! Great! 

503
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,559
So here I'd like to thank someone special in front of everyone.

504
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,620
He's very important to me and Le'an Tech.

505
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,150
Without his help, Le'an Tech would not be where it is today.

506
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,290
â™«  Even at the cost of getting bruises all over your body  â™«

507
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,969
Mr. Shi, thank you.

508
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:31,120
Thank you for extending a helping hand to Le'an in its most difficult and needy times.

509
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,200
Thank you for standing by Le'an without abandoning it.

510
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,460
Thank you for supporting it without reservation.

511
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,880
â™«  Gather energy into your heart  â™«

512
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,839
Now, let me give the floor to Mr. Shi.

513
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,030
- Shall we? 
  - Good. 

514
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:51,759
â™«  On the way of growing up, you have to taste the bitter, spicy, 
 sour and sweet things  â™«

515
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,417
I'm delighted with Le'an's achievements today.

516
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:57,160
Le'an Tech's success is also the success of Cloud Innovation.

517
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,859
The IPO marks a new beginning for Le'an Tech.

518
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:02,500
For Cloud Innovation, it's also of extraordinary significance.

519
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,239
In the future, I hope Mr. Chen will lead Le'an Tech

520
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:08,279
to go even further to create our own chips.

521
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,459
Thank you.

522
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:12,480
 - Good! 
 - Great! 

523
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,050
â™«  My promise to you will never grow cold  â™«

524
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,225
â™«  Staying piping hot  â™«

525
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:32,380
Have some dessert.

526
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,640
Here.

527
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,700
What are you doing?

528
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,860
I'm serving tea and water for Director Zheng.

529
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,819
If you'd been this sweet earlier, our children could be entering school by now.

530
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,339
What's this?

531
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,379
Make a guess.

532
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,559
Director Zheng,

533
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,840
now that you've been promoted successfully

534
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,480
when do you plan to let me get promoted around you?

535
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,839
Where's your performance report?

536
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,040
You've got nothing to say?

537
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:39,500
Then you're done for.

538
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,219
Shuyi.

539
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:50,159
Shuyi.

540
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,280
Sir, who are you?

541
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,019
Don't just casually hit on a beauty.

542
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,100
I'm a married woman.

543
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,699
This is all about the next quarter.

544
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:12,580
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

545
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,339
Shuyi.

546
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,560
Wait a moment.

547
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,140
Who's getting married?

548
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,380
You're in such a dilemma.

549
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,819
It can't be Xu Yuling, right?

550
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,560
It's me.

551
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,090
   

552
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,179
I want to invite you to be my bridesmaid.

553
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:48,599
Guan Xiangcheng?

554
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,480
It can't be the Uncle Guan I know. Right?

555
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,139
When did you twoâ€¦

556
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:58,860
It's been a while.

557
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,659
You kept me in the dark all this time!

558
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:05,634
Not fair! You have to tell me everything from the start.

559
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:07,781
Otherwise, I can't focus on work.

560
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,220
We've known each other for a long time.

561
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,500
In my third year of work,

562
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,520
I had the chance to interview him and Shi Wenguang.

563
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:42,694
â™«  A cool night at twilight  â™«

564
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:50,635
â™«  A red candle beside me for warmth  â™«

565
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:58,347
â™«  Every passing scene is all related to you  â™«

566
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:05,508
â™«  My heart harbors no regret  â™«

567
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:13,742
â™«  Amidst countless wonders  â™«

568
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:21,405
â™«  I never look back  â™«

569
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:25,103
â™«  Raindrops dance on eaves  â™«

570
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:29,254
â™«  The place where I suddenly look back  â™«

571
00:38:29,254 --> 00:38:36,256
â™«  There you are, amidst dimming lights  â™«

572
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:44,022
â™«  I am destined to be with you  â™«

573
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:51,745
â™«  Love rings are exchanged on the ring fingers  â™«

574
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:55,537
â™«  I wish there were no partings in this world  â™«

575
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:59,854
â™«  May the drifting boat dock to its shore  â™«

576
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:08,876
â™«  May lovers eventually reach perfection  â™«

577
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:15,979
â™«  And never change in this life  â™«

578
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,159
   

579
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,059
- Thank you, everyone. 
  - Congratulations, congratulations. 

580
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:40,800
Great. Thank you. Thank you!

581
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
Thanks.

582
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,440
Enjoy your meal and drinks, everyone.

583
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,460
Enjoy.

584
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,599
Make yourself at home.

585
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,199
- Enjoy. 
 - Don't be strangers.

586
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,339
Shi Yan, pour me some.

587
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:53,739
Pour her less.

588
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:55,099
- No worries. 
 - Okay, fine.

589
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,719
Uncle Guan.

590
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,659
Pour less for him, too.

591
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,259
Drink more.

592
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,459
My wish for Sister Yi and Uncle Guanâ€¦

593
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,800
This is the trial moment for our Reporter Qin. Think of something nice.

594
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,540
Otherwise, your Uncle Guan won't let you ride horses at his riding club anymore.

595
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,699
May you be happily married for eternity and your hearts forever united.

596
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:20,720
May you be blessed with bliss and sweet love.

597
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,420
Thank you for the good wishes, Shiyue.

598
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,980
As you dear Sister Yi's husband, I will not let age catch me up.

599
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,540
I will take good care of your dear Sister Yi.

600
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,020
Cheers.

601
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,500
Now that you've said all our blessings, what should we say?

602
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,940
Come on, congrats!

603
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,600
Congrats. 
 - Congrats.

604
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,599
Come on, cheers.

605
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,739
Sit down.

606
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,380
Come, sit.

607
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,640
Shiyue, since you've already sent away all our blessings,

608
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,190
drink all the wine for us, too.

609
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,000
I can drink for her.

610
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,060
But shouldn't we, as "Three Musketeers" share the burden together?

611
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,739
 Come on, Uncle Guan. Happy marriage. 

612
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:59,220
Cheers.

613
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,760
Cheers.

614
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:03,460
I have a question.

615
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,299
Xiaoming, what's your question?

616
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:08,779
Now that Xiangcheng's getting married again,

617
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:14,179
when will our Guan Ji secure his first marriage?

618
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,799
I'm ready.

619
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:23,560
But it's up to my lady.

620
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,179
I'm always in sync with Shuyi.

621
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,659
I can be ready anytime.

622
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,539
But I can't leave her behind.

623
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,619
So I want to ask Mr. Shi a question.

624
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:37,480
When do you plan to offer your proposal to Shuyi?

625
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:44,180
Shuyi, think about it and pick a day you like.

626
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,100
Yu You, aren't you the eldest of the Three Musketeers?

627
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,480
You should set an example.

628
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,659
Indeed, I've reached the age to start a family.

629
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:58,920
But as for Shiyueâ€¦

630
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,040
We have to wait for her family's approval.

631
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,200
Yeah.

632
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,619
What if my dad can't bear to part with Shiyue?

633
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,499
Grandpa definitely won't. He even urged me to get married soon.

634
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:13,219
My daughter's anxious.

635
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:16,700
Yu You, we don't accept returns.

636
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,299
Dad, what are you talking about?

637
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:23,259
Why don't the Three Musketeers get married together?

638
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:26,559
A group wedding would be lively and fun. Right?

639
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:28,699
That's a good idea.

640
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,119
 We're not in a hurry. 

641
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,960
 Along our career path, we have toâ€¦ 

642
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,480
Keep progressing.

643
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,599
Make breakthroughs.

644
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,120
Climb even higher.

645
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:47,520
In that case, let's leave it to fate.

646
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,120
To fate.

647
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,410
I'll drink to you alone.

648
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,040
Sit, sit. Take a seat.

649
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,819
Sit down.

650
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,160
Shuyi, that bouquet looks pretty.

651
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,059
But the flowers you bought yesterday are still fresh.

652
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:12,079
If you catch itâ€¦

653
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,940
What then?

654
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,780
Shanshan, this is my dad's wedding.

655
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,139
You have to fight for that bouquet.

656
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:29,760
I can't control it.

657
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:32,799
Then I'll help you fight for it.

658
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,399
Yu You, do you want me to catch the bouquet?

659
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:41,580
It's up to fate.

660
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,039
If you catch it, let's take a shortcut and get married earlier.

661
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,440
If not, I'll also put this matter on the agenda and plan it well.

662
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:00,720
Are you all ready?

663
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,799
 Ready!

 "Passerby" - Zhou Shen

â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«
