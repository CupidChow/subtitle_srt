 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,625
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,675
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,888
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,325
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,699
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,950
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,200
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,550
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,485
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:12,945
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,150
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,575
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,011
   

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,100
   

23
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,660
Mr. Shi, Mr. Tian and some shareholders say they can't reach you.

24
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,719
They wanted you to call them when you are free.

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,900
Got it.

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,120
 Mr. Shi, did you read that Financial Introduce article? 

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,519
 The article that Zheng Shuyi wrote. 

28
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,779
 I am sorry. 

29
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:50,639
 Le'an's problem has brought crises and burdens to Cloud Innovation. 

30
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,640
Chen Kang, Cloud Innovation and Le'an are partners.

31
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,620
We go through thick and thin together. Don't talk about burden.

32
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,219
Now that things have happened, we should think about the next step for Le'an.

33
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,480
 I've been thinking a lot. 

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,240
 I will consider the cooperation between Le'an and Black Horse. 

35
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,520
If you need it, I can contact Yi Yang for you.

36
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,039
Fiona, please come to my office.

37
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,460
They cooperate but do not merge.

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,520
And they share the results?

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,420
They conduct special cooperation to overcome this technology challenge

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,839
and share the results. Is it feasible?

41
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:49,820
Let's leave aside the question of dividing patents and the distribution of revenues,

42
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,360
and only focus on their competitive relationships.

43
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,140
We know the consequences will be complicated.

44
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,900
And Black Horse wants to acquire Le'an.

45
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,739
Will they agree to cooperate?

46
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm not sure.

47
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,019
But Black Horse's progress is not that smooth.

48
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,700
I want to try.

49
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,919
If you want to try, go ahead.

50
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,040
I'll take care of the legal issues and the details.

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,719
Thank you.

52
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,759
- About Mr. Tianâ€¦ 
 - Don't worry.

53
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,859
If Le'an is doing well, my dad will make money.

54
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,499
He won't be mad at me.

55
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,700
   

56
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,200
Will my article get Shi Yan in trouble?

57
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,960
You are back.

58
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,760
Are you tired? Let me give you a massage.

59
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,839
Did you do something bad?

60
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,500
I didn't.

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,599
I haven't seen you all day. I missed you.

62
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,479
Have you read my article?

63
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,860
The writing is sharp. The article is as good as ever.

64
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,019
Is the article too sharp?

65
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,399
Did the board put pressure on you?

66
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,959
Your article is well-founded. It's great.

67
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,119
Their pressure on me has nothing to do with your article.

68
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,819
They did put pressure on you.

69
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,879
What can I do for you?

70
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,480
You're stating facts and making an opinion.

71
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,900
That's the meaning and value of journalism.

72
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,500
Maybe someone will get a new idea after reading it.

73
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,460
Maybe Cloud Innovation will get new opportunities.

74
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,220
If you want to make it up to me, you can do me a favor.

75
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,500
What favor?

76
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't have Yi Yang's contact information.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,099
I want to meet him.

78
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,720
Yi Yang?

79
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,660
Do you want to talk to him about Le'an?

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,720
Can I be there when you meet?

81
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,580
It's a trade secret.

82
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,460
Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

83
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,520
   

84
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,639
Did you convince Mr. Chen?

85
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,379
I didn't.

86
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,379
I'm here to convince you to give up on the merger.

87
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,539
Mr. Shi, you are so funny.

88
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,560
Le'an has a mature team and production line.

89
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,080
Black Horse has core technical talent like Bruce.

90
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,679
You have your own strengths and plans.

91
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,580
A merger is not the best choice for either party.

92
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,500
Le'an wants to build domestic chips and continuously upgrade its technology.

93
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,920
They can't accept Black Horse's merger.

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,880
Black Horse is more ambitious in technology.

95
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,399
Otherwise, Bruce wouldn't have joined Black Horse.

96
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,160
But Bruce's development hasn't progressed.

97
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,440
Mr. Yi, please consider this.

98
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,980
You can cooperate to overcome the technology challenge

99
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,619
and share the honors and the results.

100
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,840
Mr. Shi,

101
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Le'an's current situation can be said to be a dead end.

102
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,160
Who are you to discuss cooperation with me?

103
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,399
To be honest,

104
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,900
Chen Kang knows that if he doesn't accept Black Horse's merger,

105
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,660
Le'an will fail.

106
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,700
Black Horse's situation is the same.

107
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,200
Bruce is very capable.

108
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,619
But technology development can't be done by one person alone.

109
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:46,399
Where are you going to find mature technical talents to work with Bruce?

110
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,040
Even if you can find them, do you know how long it takes?

111
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,059
You might as well consider my suggestion.

112
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,140
You can cooperate to achieve a win-win situation first.

113
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,259
And you can save time to recruit talent.

114
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,619
The technology will continue to iterate.

115
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,739
It's just one stage of the game.

116
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:16,260
In the next stage, Black Horse and Le'an can compete on their own.

117
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,900
I'll consider your suggestion.

118
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,999
You came to me for help today.

119
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:33,799
Does Shuyi know this?

120
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,059
I should thank my girlfriend.

121
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,919
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to meet you so easily.

122
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
   

123
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,380
How could it be

124
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,779
Qin Xiaoming?

125
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,480
Hello, where are you?

126
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,620
 I'm in the hospital. Shiyue had a car accident. 

127
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,799
What happened?

128
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,520
Is she all right? What's going on?

129
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,479
 It's nothing big; not serious. 

130
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,999
Which hospital are you in?

131
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,260
 The First Hospital of Jiangcheng. 

132
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,280
I will be there in a minute.

133
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,570
Hello, Shiyueâ€¦

134
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,779
 Yu You, it's me. 

135
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,080
Where is Shiyue?

136
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,800
 She had a car accident. She is being examined. 

137
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,839
Car accident? Which hospital are you in?

138
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,140
Is Shiyue all right?

139
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,260
Yes. She is in shock. The doctor has examined her.

140
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,219
She only suffered a few abrasions.

141
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,440
I told you she was all right. You didn't have to rush here.

142
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you think everyone is like you?

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,340
You're very calm about things.

144
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,160
Did you see the news?

145
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,120
Mr. Qin was photographed.

146
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,100
He was with Song Lelan. I saw it.

147
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,999
How can you be so calm?

148
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,619
What's wrong?

149
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,279
I'm as sad as you are.

150
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,840
Why?

151
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,020
This is the closest I've ever been to my idol.

152
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,579
She and my boyfriend's brother-in-law did this.

153
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,900
How did this happen?

154
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,619
Mr. Qin and Song Lelan hugged.

155
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,600
Isn't she an artist of both moral and artistic stature?

156
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,619
But she did this.

157
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,540
She said she would sing about love forever.

158
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,240
Isn't that ridiculous? Isn't she ashamed?

159
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,419
Sister.

160
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,540
 I didn't expect to meet Shi Yan's sister for the first time on such an embarrassing occasion. 

161
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,499
 It sucks to be betrayed. 

162
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,700
 It's an illusion, right? 

163
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,850
Shuyi, call her "Sister."

164
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,880
 Shi Huaiman is Song Lelan. 

165
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,220
 Song Lelan is Shi Huaiman. 

166
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,960
Sister.

167
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,180
You look like Song Lelan.

168
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,040
Everyone says the same thing.

169
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,379
Excuse me.

170
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,440
 I experienced a second social death. 

171
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,919
 It's irreparable. 

172
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,779
Is there anything you want to tell me?

173
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,740
Yes. I am married.

174
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,940
I didn't tell my fans.

175
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,559
Why are you so cute?

176
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,120
Is that funny?

177
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,699
You are awake.

178
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:19,240
- How do you feel? 
 - Mom.

179
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,219
I saw the news.

180
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:25,460
I am sorry.

181
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,320
Don't be silly.

182
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,100
I'm the one who should say sorry.

183
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,480
I'm sorry to you.

184
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,559
Don't blame yourself.

185
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,760
You have been hiding your marital status for so many years.

186
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,599
All you want is for us to have a normal life not to affect Shiyue.

187
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,299
Your mom found out you were in an accident on the phone.

188
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:54,240
She left the recording site and came to the hospital right away.

189
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,360
Mom, I am fine.

190
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,039
Really.

191
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,259
Great.

192
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,919
Miss, I am sorry.

193
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,160
Someone called me at the time.

194
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm a delivery man. I don't have any money.

195
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,400
- Please forgive meâ€¦ 
 - Enough.

196
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,479
Thankfully, she's fine.

197
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:23,240
We don't want to argue with you.

198
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,639
Thank you.

199
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,440
Wait.

200
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,959
Sir,

201
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,539
do you know you can't talk on the phone while driving?

202
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,759
Thankfully, I'm fine.

203
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,479
If you hit an old man in poor health, the consequences would be terrible.

204
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:43,979
So you need to be responsible for this.

205
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,800
You said you wouldn't argue with me.

206
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,859
That's what my mom said. It doesn't represent my will.

207
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,620
Do you want to avoid responsibility?

208
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,820
I tell you. You have to pay for everything.

209
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,140
Shiyue, if you need anything, or you want to eat or drink anything,

210
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,740
just tell your uncle. He will buy it for you.

211
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,659
Thank you, Auntie.

212
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:24,480
Sit down.

213
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,799
Sit down.

214
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,540
You are Shiyue's professor.

215
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,659
Not exactly.

216
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,740
She often comes to my classes.

217
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,559
Often?

218
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,179
Good.

219
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,499
You can make her willing to go to class.

220
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,220
I'll go explain it to the company.

221
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,200
You go back home.

222
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,740
Sister.

223
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,260
I apologize for what I said.

224
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,760
I didn't know you were Shi Yan's sister, Shiyue's mother.

225
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,319
No worries.

226
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,540
You didn't know.

227
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:30,060
Butâ€¦ Shi Yan never told you about me?

228
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,940
Bye-bye, Sister.

229
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,759
Bye-bye.

230
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,820
What's wrong?

231
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,219
You're one to talk. You are single at this moment.

232
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,060
Shuyi...

233
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,440
Are you angry?

234
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,960
Let's talk about it at home.

235
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,440
I don't have a home.

236
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,480
I didn't tell you at first

237
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,259
because I wanted to surprise you.

238
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,172
Really?

239
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:37,920
I'm so surprised. Surprise.

240
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,959
What are you thinking about?

241
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,740
I'm wondering if the recycling station will accept the boyfriend I dumped.

242
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,839
It's late. Let's go home.

243
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,719
You're right. It's late. Time to go home.

244
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,119
Let's go.

245
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,759
Why are you following me?

246
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,379
Why not?

247
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:24,959
I want to sleep on pink sheets.

248
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,620
Did I ask you to sleep over?

249
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,139
What do I do?

250
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,260
Won't you come home with me?

251
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,220
No.

252
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,319
Shi Yan, I tell you. I cherish my reputation.

253
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:45,119
You embarrassed me in front of my idol. This isn't over.

254
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,000
Is it dead?

255
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,540
Where is my key?

256
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
What?

257
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,020
Are you praying again?

258
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
 Never wash your dirty linen in public. 

259
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,319
 Shanshan will laugh at me. 

260
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,440
 But he won't speak. 

261
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,059
 If I don't knock on the door, I will be ashamed. 

262
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,599
Youâ€¦

263
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,759
Youâ€¦

264
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,700
Honey, who is that?

265
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,580
Shanshan,

266
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,200
him?

267
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,299
Didn't you tell meâ€¦

268
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:17,900
Why don't you come in? I will explain it to you.

269
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,259
Shuyi, you met her.

270
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:29,140
It's late. Let's go home.

271
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,820
We will visit you next time. I will take her home.

272
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,320
Okay. Visit us next time.

273
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,559
- What do you want to eat? 
 - I don't want to eat. I have no appetite.

274
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,739
Really?

275
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:59,260
I don't know when I'll be able to cook next time.

276
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,780
Do you want to make it up to me?

277
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,939
Can I?

278
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,800
It depends on how good your food is.

279
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,780
It's not like you haven't eaten it. What do you want to eat?

280
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,759
A Chinese Feast.

281
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,980
Dinner is ready.

282
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,779
I am not hungry.

283
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:35,339
If it doesn't taste great, I won't eat it.

284
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,180
I will let it go.

285
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,840
If you lie to me again,

286
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,440
even if you are a Michelin chef, I won't forgive you.

287
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,800
Technically, I didn't lie to you.

288
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,300
I've never told you that Song Lelan was not my sister.

289
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,699
You knew I loved her.

290
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,039
But you never told me about it.

291
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,340
It's a big deal, but you never mentioned it.

292
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:30,119
Didn't I mention it?

293
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,859
Last time I had noodles with you, did I ask you if you wanted to talk to her?

294
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:40,999
 Would you like to say hello to my sister? 

295
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,659
 Your sister doesn't work at Mingyu. What does she do? 

296
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:46,840
 Sheâ€¦ 

297
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,779
 She sings and dances. She doesn't do anything else. 

298
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,680
Shi Yan!

299
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,040
What's wrong?

300
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,240
I hate you.

301
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,039
Are you full?

302
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,419
Shuyi.

303
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,599
Shuyi, are you asleep?

304
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,720
 The sofa in the living room is large. The pillow in the guest room is soft. 

305
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
 Choose one. 

306
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,580
 Really? Song Lelan. 

307
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,680
 She's Shi Yan's sister. 

308
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,000
It's true.

309
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,480
Calm down. You are so loud.

310
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,219
You might not want to believe this, but I didn't find out until today.

311
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,420
Yes. I locked him out.

312
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,959
He's not coming in until I get over it.

313
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,960
Did I allow you to come in?

314
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,719
- Shuyiâ€¦ 
 - Get outâ€¦

315
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,859
How do you get over it?

316
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,240
Tell me.

317
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,100
 It's easy. Don't be a coward, Mr. Shi. 

318
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,860
Guan Ji, just stop it!

319
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,960
Leave her alone.

320
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,899
Shiyue, what are you talking about?

321
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:33,419
I know. Ms. Shan is beautiful and sweet.

322
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,480
Guan Ji, don't you know yourself?

323
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,659
Let go of your hand.

324
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:41,699
Ms. Shan, stay away from him.

325
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:46,036
What kind of person am I? We are in love with each other now.

326
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:48,639
We'll not stay away from each other.

327
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,000
We'll get closer and closer.

328
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,860
It's over.

329
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,440
The Beast caught the Beauty.

330
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,720
What are you talking about? Who is the Beauty? Who is the Beast?

331
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,959
No, I will call Shuyi.

332
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:11,379
I will protect Ms. Shanshan. I can't let her fall into your trap.

333
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm the one who needs to be protected.

334
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,880
I fell into her trap.

335
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,480
I'm all hers. I can't live without her.

336
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:23,900
My god.

337
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,240
Are you the same Guan Ji I know?

338
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,079
Sister Shan,

339
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,000
you are brilliant.

340
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,419
There's no brilliant person in love.

341
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:39,340
We met people we liked.

342
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,480
We couldn't escape from it.

343
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,739
No one is going to believe that.

344
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:49,440
I worked with Song Lelan's daughter for a few months.

345
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,219
- You mean Song Lelan? 
 - Yes.

346
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:53,480
- Why did her daughter work here? 
 - I don't know.

347
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,220
- My god. 
 - How did they learn it?

348
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,100
Do you think it's still the era of 2G networks? Netizens know everything.

349
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Everyone knows Qin Shiyue is Song Lelan's daughter.

350
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,100
Do I have something on my face?

351
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,319
Ms. Shuyi, is your boyfriend Shi Yan?

352
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,759
Song Lelan's brother?

353
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,800
How do you find out?

354
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,940
Ms. Yuling said that.

355
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,585
She said you were dating Qin Shiyue's uncle.

356
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:29,940
Qin Shiyue's uncle is Shi Yan. Right?

357
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,160
It's true.

358
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,000
It's true.

359
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,659
I know what you want to ask.

360
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,440
She joined 4A.

361
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,765
She's clever. And she has leadership qualities.

362
00:28:47,765 --> 00:28:50,859
She will have a better future at 4A.

363
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:55,300
It's so big of you. You want her to have a better future?

364
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,780
Looks like Shi Yan is taking good care of you.

365
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
You look great.

366
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,139
Thank you.

367
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,060
If you're rested, start working.

368
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,579
You don't have any other plans, do you?

369
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:19,939
No.

370
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:23,680
Don't worry, Sister Yi. I love my job.

371
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,540
The features of Cloud Innovation and returnees starting their business received a lot of positive reviews.

372
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,659
Your capability speaks for itself.

373
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,780
The lead editor praised you at the meeting the other day.

374
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,900
It's all thanks to you.

375
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,379
Get ready.

376
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:44,279
Get ready for what?

377
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,380
Get ready to set up an integrated media team.

378
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,000
Zheng Shuyi, here's your chance.

379
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,939
Go for it.

380
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:56,719
Don't worry, Sister Yi. I'll make readers love the integrated media.

381
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,799
Let me.

382
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:12,580
I didn't slack off. I was tired of holding it.

383
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,259
Let me hold it for you. Ask me if you don't understand anything.

384
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,240
Lean on me if you get tired.

385
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,559
Finally, she's kept in line.

386
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,779
Yu You is a good guy.

387
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:46,160
And he is good to Shiyue.

388
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,759
You should be relieved.

389
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,319
I thought you wouldn't come.

390
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,619
I'm a professional journalist. I will try to seize all the news.

391
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,039
Okay.

392
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,619
Let's get down to business.

393
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:08,359
The cooperation between Black Horse and Le'an is imminent.

394
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:11,279
We see hope for breakthroughs in key technologies for millimeter wave chips.

395
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,959
I'd like you to do an exclusive on this.

396
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,780
This is a revolutionary breakthrough.

397
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,400
I broke the shackles to make this happen.

398
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,260
I don't want to waste everyone's effort and dedication.

399
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,039
This cooperation deserves to be documented and reported.

400
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,180
You are willing to challenge and innovate.

401
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,399
It really worth learning and to appreciate.

402
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,780
If it wasn't for Shi Yan, this cooperation wouldn't have happened.

403
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,279
His wisdom and thoughts allowed him to break the game.

404
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,859
He came up with a win-win cooperation to convince Chen Kang.

405
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:40,699
So here we are.

406
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,260
There is no doubt about the value and significance of this feature.

407
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,840
Financial Introduce won't miss this chance.

408
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,859
Mr. Yi, I am not the best person for this feature.

409
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:54,779
Shuyi, I know your talents and abilities.

410
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,720
I want you to do this exclusive.

411
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,140
As you said, a good feature is not just one person's effort and dedication.

412
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,740
We have a lot of good journalists at the magazine.

413
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,759
You can trust them.

414
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,980
Okay, I believe you.

415
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,100
I will ask your colleague to do it.

416
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,180
I believe Black Horse will change people's lives with technology,

417
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,260
and you won't let us down.

418
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,670
 Hey, 

419
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,099
 isn't this your boyfriend? 

420
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,999
 You saw it. 

421
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,859
 Information spreads quickly. Everyone knows it. 

422
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,660
 I've been asked every day. It's annoying. 

423
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,059
 You're quite into the drama. 

424
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,020
 Mom, he is really my boyfriend. 

425
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,849
   

426
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,160
Where is this?

427
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,039
Shuyi.

428
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,659
 Hello. 

429
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:40,879
Yi, are you still up?

430
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:42,859
What are you doing?

431
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,379
She's taking a shower.

432
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,540
Who is this?

433
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,140
Were you talking?

434
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,980
I answered the phone.

435
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,474
Your phone.

436
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,419
Who called me? Ms. Tang?

437
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,079
Your mother.

438
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,735
What did my mom say to you?

439
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,199
She wanted you to wait.

440
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,439
She was looking for your stepfather.

441
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,500
Why did you call me so late?

442
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,060
 You are impatient. 

443
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,040
I want to ask you if you will come home on May Day.

444
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,320
I know where you're going with this. I don't want to.

445
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:48,660
What's wrong?

446
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,819
Are you free on May Day?

447
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,359
No.

448
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,079
But I will make time.

449
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:02,600
Please say it all at once.

450
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,760
Okay, got it. Let me see.

451
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,200
I'm a little busy as of late. I'll go home if I am not busy. I will call you.

452
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,979
What are you reading? Is the book better than me?

453
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,460
Am I dressed too simply?

454
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,660
Will they think I'm old?

455
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,239
I'm going to change my clothes.

456
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
You look great.

457
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,720
What you think doesn't matter.

458
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,280
I don't know what your sister thinks of me.

459
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't want to make a bad impression on your dad.

460
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,180
I like you, and so will they.

461
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,060
Take it easy. Don't be nervous.

462
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,779
What did you say?

463
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:06,560
I said we were just going to eat. Take it easy. Don't be nervous.

464
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,199
Not this one.

465
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Let's go inside.

466
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,680
Say it. The previous sentence.

467
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,579
I like you.

468
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:21,480
I like you, too.

469
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,860
Let's go.

470
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,999
Dad. Sister.

471
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,659
This is my girlfriend, Zheng Shuyi.

472
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,899
Sir, nice to meet you. Sister, nice to meet you.

473
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:41,900
Nice to meet you.

474
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,559
We have been looking forward to Shi Yan bringing you back.

475
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,239
Don't just stand there.

476
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,579
Have a seat.

477
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,059
Sit.

478
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:56,339
Sister, tell me more about him.

479
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,619
Shi Yan has always been keen on face-saving.

480
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:03,120
No matter what you ask him, he's likeâ€¦

481
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,260
Right. He still does that.

482
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,860
So I call him "hmmm-monster."

483
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,100
Shuyi, eat some fruits.

484
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,159
I am back.

485
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,540
Grandpa. Mom. Uncle.

486
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,280
Auntie.

487
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,239
You must not have seen our yard yet. I will show you around.

488
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,550
I'll go with Shiyue.

489
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:45,460
Go ahead.

490
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,740
 (Auntie.) 

491
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,160
Let's go.

492
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,600
Sister.

493
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,460
Everyone knows who you are.

494
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,539
How do you feel?

495
00:37:57,539 --> 00:37:59,300
I just want to do my job.

496
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,680
I've told them. But my dad and my uncle don't believe me.

497
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,560
What others think doesn't matter. It's important to do what you like.

498
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,920
We can't live by what others think.

499
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,860
I now know what I like.

500
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:18,320
I can't believe you just said these words to me.

501
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,459
It's not me who actually said them.

502
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:22,840
Was it Yu You?

503
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,500
I cook great good.

504
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,259
Shi Yan must have done something great in a former life.

505
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,980
You are back.

506
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,580
Mom.

507
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,239
What's wrong?

508
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:50,580
We haven't seen each other in months, do you not recognize me?

509
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,380
How did you get here together?

510
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,420
We met at the airport.

511
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,460
Did you cook?

512
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,160
Madam, I will leave you alone.

513
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,400
Why did you come without telling me?

514
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,940
I wanted a surprise inspection.

515
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,179
It's really a common problem amongst teachers.

516
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,220
You two haven't met, have you? How did you come back together?

517
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,740
We haven't met before. But I've seen his pictures.

518
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,960
You've posted them before.

519
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,799
I recognized him at the airport.

520
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:36,860
So I came here with him.

521
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,220
You're living in his house.

522
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,879
But you didn't tell me about it.

523
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,480
When I was a junior in high school, you went to Singapore without telling me.

524
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,900
You said you were going to Niupengpore.

525
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,619
It's not the same.

526
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,179
Is this what you usually eat?

527
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,260
It's not bad.

528
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,860
It's better than takeaway food.

529
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,340
We don't usually eat this. I usually cook.

530
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,400
Thank you.

531
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,380
It's my pleasure.

532
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,960
 You've only cooked a few times. 

533
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,239
 Shame on you. 

534
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:45,299
Mom, are you leaving?

535
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,840
Yi,

536
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,940
Shi Yan takes good care of you. I am relieved.

537
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,420
I am going back to Qing'an tonight.

538
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,884
I have an early class in the morning.

539
00:40:56,884 --> 00:40:59,139
I will leave you alone.

540
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:01,600
Mom.

541
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,600
 How can you smile like that? What's wrong with you? 

542
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,139
Madam, let me escort you.

543
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:16,980
I am back.

544
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,000
No. There is no airport in Qing'an.

545
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,520
My mom should not have landed at Jiangcheng International Airport.

546
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,560
Didn't you go to the airport to pick up a technical expert from France?

547
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,980
How did you run into each other at the airport?

548
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,560
She and her friend came back from Southeast Asia.

549
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,820
She needs to take the high-speed train back to Qing'an from Jiangcheng

550
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:41,619
You twoâ€¦

551
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:55,059
Shi Yan played the matchmaker and got Le'an and Black Horse to collaborate and share the results.

552
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,920
He let Black Horse share the results for no reason.

553
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,800
He's throwing our money around.

554
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,479
I don't know what he said to Feifei. And Feifei is following his lead.

555
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:06,079
We can't go on like this.

556
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,480
Let's go to Old Shi and ask him to make the decision.

557
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,940
You're right.

558
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,519
Old Shi, we don't want to bother you.

559
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,380
But Shi Yan made us do it.

560
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,800
He played the matchmaker for Le'an and Black Horse,

561
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,219
and let Black Horse share the results for no reason.

562
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:28,639
Is that what an investor should do?

563
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,300
I've never seen anything like it.

564
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,679
I think he's in the wrong business.

565
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,339
You should let him do charity work.

566
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:37,960
You must not have heard it.

567
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,160
Guan Ji doesn't work hard either.

568
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,179
It's a mess here.

569
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:45,480
But he didn't come to help Shi Yan.

570
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,920
He gave horses to girls.

571
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,580
Do you know what people say?

572
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,860
What did they say?

573
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:02,900
 Shi Yan is too young to have a vision. So it led to failure. 

574
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,360
 Cloud Innovation's post-investment management has gone wrong. 

575
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,119
 They opened a door to a dangerous person. Bruce was poached. 

576
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,760
 So Le'an was forced to cooperate with Black Horse. 

577
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,460
Check this out.

578
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,160
 Cloud Innovation played the matchmaker. 

579
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,800
 Le'an and Black Horse officially announced their cooperation. 

580
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,340
 Mingyu Cloud Innovation, the company that invested in Le'an, has been questioned. 

581
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,979
 Black Horse's CEO Yi Yang said he would choose the media to disclose the details. 

582
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:35,840
 Mingyu Cloud Innovation's president, Mr. Shi, did not respond to it. 

583
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,600
Old Shi,

584
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,860
we don't want to bring it up again.

585
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,820
But you have to make a decision.

586
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,240
We can't go on like this. Shi Yan has made mistakes again and again.

587
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,920
Sooner or later, Cloud Innovation will be ruined by him.

588
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,060
How about this?

589
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,819
We put Xiaoming in charge of Cloud Innovation.

590
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,760
 Cloud Innovation, the investor behind Le'an, faces questioning. 

591
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:14,880
Mr. Shi,

592
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
some media outlets invited you to talk about

593
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,120
what you think of the collaboration between Le'an and Black Horse.

594
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,519
Turn them down.

595
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:34,010

 "Passerby" - Zhou Shen

00:44:52,780 --> 00:45:00,520
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

â™«  Can a happy ending be fixed?  â™«

â™«  Falling in love with you, losing you  â™«

00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:23,006
â™«  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  â™«

602

â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

603
00:45:29,298 --> 00:45:35,187
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

604
00:45:36,288 --> 00:45:41,445
â™«  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  â™«

605

â™«  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  â™«

608

609

â™«  Does it hurt  â™«
