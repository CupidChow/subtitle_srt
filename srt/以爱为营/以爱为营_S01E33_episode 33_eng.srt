 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:32,180
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,605
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:38,580
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,180
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,805
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,305
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:50,691
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,930
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,005
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,280
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,505
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:06,505
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,555
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:12,925
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:16,380
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,180
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,255
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:36,005
   

21
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,991
   

22
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,650
You've been standing here for ten minutes.

23
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,570
What are you doing?

24
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,080
Admiring my beauty.

25
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,719
What are you doing standing here?

26
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,980
Admiring your beauty.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,340
Drink some water to sober up.

28
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,720
Have you seen enough?

29
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,460
Yes.

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you leaving now?

31
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,419
You don't want me to leave? Do you want to keep me overnight?

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,759
No.

33
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,520
I was just thinking whether I should walk you out.

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,500
After all, you're so drunk. You might get lost and then I wouldn't have a boyfriend.

35
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,639
 If you dare say, "You're not my girlfriend yet because your performance's not good," 

36
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:40,139
 you may see the headline tomorrow "Female Reporter Killing CEO: Is It for Money or Love?" 

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,200
I won't let you be without a boyfriend.

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,660
Rest early, I'm leaving.

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,599
Wait a moment.

40
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,000
Give me your phone.

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,900
Okay, you can go now. Be safe.

42
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,460
Good night.

43
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,059
Shiyue, eat.

44
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,151
My Dear Honey?

45
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,380
Who's "My Dear Honey"?

46
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,519
Is she Shuâ€¦?

47
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,600
I'll shut up.

48
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:20,900
Hello.

49
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,700
 - Are you up yet?  
 - Yes.

50
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,600
 - Have you eaten?  
 - I'm eating right now.

51
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,120
Anything else?

52
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,619
 No, I'm just missing you. 

53
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,159
Your girlfriend?

54
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,319
So lovey-dovey. It's not like you!

55
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,759
"My Dear Honey"?

56
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,660
Time for you to work!

57
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,659
Grandpa, Mom, Uncle, I'm off to work.

58
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,619
Go on then.

59
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,000
Shi Yan,

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,420
bring her over some day.

61
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,660
I'll ask her.

62
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,419
Seems like this business trip was quite fruitful.

63
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
Indeed, it was.

64
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Not just in terms of interviews. Right?

65
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,760
You fell in love?

66
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,020
Regardless of who he is, don't let him interfere with work.

67
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,759
Don't worry, Sister Yi. Love and work are equally important to me.

68
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,179
Is he a considerate boyfriend?

69
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,179
I'm very happy with him.

70
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,719
That's good to hear.

71
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,079
Sister Yi,

72
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,340
do you plan to date someone and get all lovey-dovey?

73
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,034
Knock it off. Stop teasing me.

74
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:09,580
I'm too old to be like you young girls.

75
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,199
Why not? Who says there's an age limit for love?

76
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,900
If you like someone, go for it, Sister Yi.

77
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,680
I'll go back to my articles.

78
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,959
Guan.

79
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,060
Ms. Tang.

80
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,680
Take a seat.

81
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,720
Thank you.

82
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,360
Phoenix Narcissus.

83
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,999
Since we set the meeting, Dad reminded me countless times that you like this tea.

84
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,800
I promised him I'd remember. But he was still worried, saying we have to remind the tea house.

85
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,440
So I had to call them in front of him. Then he was relieved.

86
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,480
I got home late last night, and I found him waiting for me downstairs.

87
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,759
I thought he had some urgent matter.

88
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,639
Guess what he told me.

89
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,679
 Phoenix Narcissus is originally from Phoenix Mountain in Guangdong Province. 

90
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,500
 It relieves cough and generates saliva. 

91
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,720
 It has a history of over nine hundred years. 

92
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,279
 The largest surviving Phoenix Narcissus is called Grand Fragrance. 

93
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,639
I asked him why he was telling me all that?

94
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:39,740
He blushed and said you're a bit shy, so he feared we'd have nothing to talk about today.

95
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,099
I comforted him. Even if we'd have nothing to say, I couldn't recite something he told me.

96
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,920
He cares for you.

97
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,020
And cares for you a lot.

98
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,919
I know.

99
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,259
He's capableâ€¦

100
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,659
capable of protecting you.

101
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,779
And you're strong enough.

102
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,159
So you can protect yourself.

103
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,320
This doesn't make sense.

104
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,440
What?

105
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,879
You've known him for over a decade now. Right?

106
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,100
Did he tell you that he and I don't get along or that I'm a good-for-nothing?

107
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,740
And that I'm afraid that someone will take away my inheritance.

108
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,559
He's got a weird sense of humor, though. But he wouldn't have gone this far.

109
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,059
He didn't.

110
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,160
He just feels he owes you a lot.

111
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,719
Soâ€¦

112
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:02,240
you're afraid that he will owe me more if he's with me.

113
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,310
That meansâ€¦

114
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,720
Old Guan is also very important to you.

115
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,800
You care about what he thinks and says.

116
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:25,500
I remember when I was a kid, he'd ride horses with me on weekends no matter how busy he was.

117
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,400
Although relationships depend on fate,

118
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,500
it was only after I took over the company that he began to think about personal matters.

119
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,000
So he doesn't owe me anything.

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Instead, he gave me a lot of love and the best education.

121
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,500
Now, he wants to give his love to you.

122
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,700
As his son, I hope you can give him a chance.

123
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,810
Guan Ji,

124
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,700
thank you.

125
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,000
I've always cherished my relationship with your father.

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Therefore, I had many concerns.

127
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,700
You are, of course, the first person we need to care for.

128
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,100
I'm much older, so I should've been the one to initiate the talk.

129
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,000
But you beat me to the punch.

130
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,900
What you said today is indeed very important to me.

131
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,000
But now that we had the talk, I seem to need to give Old Guan a definite answer.

132
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,600
Then I'll wait for your good news.

133
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,900
Have some.

134
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,100
Okay. I'll go with Chen Kang.

135
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,800
No problem, see you then.

136
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,500
Are you done with the entry procedure?

137
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Brother Shi Yan,

138
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,400
how's Le'an Tech?

139
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Mr. Mo went to see my dad before leaving.

140
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,400
My dadâ€¦ then talked to Uncle Shi and Mr. Qin.

141
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,800
Le'an Tech is in a critical situation now.

142
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,100
If this technological upgrade fails, our initial investment will indeed be in vain.

143
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,300
Do you have a solution?

144
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,000
How aboutâ€¦ I talk to my dad for you?

145
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,900
Don't cause Mr. Tian any trouble.

146
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,400
I have an idea I'd like to go over with Chen Kang this afternoon.

147
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,500
But I don't know if it will work.

148
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
Is that all?

149
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,200
That's all.

150
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,300
Our team isn't mature enough yet. They're still adjusting.

151
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
We can't make much practical progress.

152
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm trying to rush things, but you know too that it's hard to do it alone.

153
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,700
I need more time and more people.

154
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,200
So I'll be counting on you.

155
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Mr. Chen, Mr. Yi from Dark Horse Technology is here. He says he has something to discuss with you.

156
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,400
Let him in.

157
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,200
- I'm pretty much finished here. I'll leave first. 
 - Okay. Thanks.

158
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,300
Great timing! You're here too, Mr. Shi.

159
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,600
Please wait.

160
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,700
I'd like to discuss something with Mr. Chen.

161
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,200
Why don't you join us?

162
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,600
I don't know what you're here for today.

163
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Then I'll get straight to the point.

164
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Today, I came to discuss the possibility of Dark Horse acquiring Le'an.

165
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,000
Your labs are almost at a standstill now.

166
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,600
The lab results left by Bruce mean nothing to you.

167
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Collaborating with Dark Horse is your best way out for the time being.

168
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,400
No way! I will never agree!

169
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,200
Mr. Yi, don't forget who caused us to fall like this.

170
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,900
Mr. Chen,

171
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,200
don't get so worked up. These are normal thoughts.

172
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,800
Both of us aim to research domestic millimeter-wave chips.

173
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,900
We have the same goal and direction. Why not let go of past grievances and join hands?

174
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,100
This is the only way to secure a bright future and gain an advantage.

175
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,300
Mr. Chen, give my proposal some thought.

176
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,600
Mr. Shi, maybe you can help me persuade Mr. Chen.

177
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,900
I'll leave now.

178
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,450
   

179
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,820
Are you coming back from a business trip today? What time will you arrive?

180
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,900
 7:00. Why? 

181
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
 Is our top journalist coming to pick me up? 

182
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,700
Make a guess.

183
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,700
Mister, please take me to Jiangcheng International Airport T2. Thank you.

184
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,400
What's this for?

185
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,700
You came to pick your girlfriend up, but you didn't even bring flowers as a gift.

186
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,200
That makes you a private driver. Right?

187
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,900
How much?

188
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,600
1905 yuan.

189
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,200
Even to exact change? Did you make your fortune by robbing people?

190
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,900
No, I made it on my own.

191
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,600
Mr. Driver, you sure know how to surprise people.

192
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,500
 Oh, dear! I actually met Song Lelan. She didn't take the VIP passage. 

193
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,300
 Are you coming or not? Hurry, at the arrival floor. 

194
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
 So many people here are asking to take a photo with her. 

195
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,500
 - She's not refusing anyone.  
 - Wait for me. I'm on my way.

196
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,300
 Song Lelan! 

197
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
 Song Lelan! 

198
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,300
Bye-bye.

199
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
 Bye. 

200
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Bye! 

201
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,000
She's so beautiful. She's even prettier than on TV.

202
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,500
She's just a bit younger than my mom. But why does she look so much younger?

203
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,980
Celebrities are different, huh? Seems like they have ten more years of youth.

204
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,800
During her concert, she kept singing for over two hours straight.

205
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,700
What endurance!

206
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,200
Even I, in my twenties, can't compare.

207
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,100
She's a true diva indeed. She's really impressive.

208
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,200
Why doesn't she get married? Many stars of her generation have retired.

209
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,500
Only she's still active and even holds concerts every year.

210
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,400
Speaking of which. My friends say that she actually got married in secret.

211
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,500
She even has two sons.

212
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,800
Don't listen to their nonsense.

213
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,200
In the past decade, she's been releasing albums non-stop. Her concerts are always full.

214
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,300
She was never out of the public eye. She wouldn't have had the time to have kids?

215
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,400
But years ago, she was seen wearing a diamond ring on her ring finger.

216
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
Wearing diamond rings has nothing to do with marriage.

217
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,500
Didn't they clarify it already? It was a ring from a sponsor.

218
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,900
Oh, is that so?

219
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,500
But her song "Dear Gift" is clearly written for a child.

220
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,200
You know that, right?

221
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,000
That's artistic license. It doesn't have to be her personal experience.

222
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,700
Otherwise, those who sing sad songs must have really miserable lives.

223
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,000
Following your logic, I must be rich since I write about billion-worth projects every day.

224
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,200
But the expensive projects have nothing to do with me.

225
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,300
You make a good point.

226
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,600
Okay, stop gossiping.

227
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,500
If she was secretly married and had children, I'll give you a beheading show on the spot!

228
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,400
- Allow me to help. 
 - No, no need. I can do it myself.

229
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,100
Just let him help.

230
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,000
Otherwise, he'll be afraid I'll go find another, more gentlemanly boyfriend.

231
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

232
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
You really like Song Lelan so much?

233
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,700
Didn't you know?

234
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,800
The first time I went to your house I told you I really liked her.

235
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,000
That was not a lie, not just a line to hit on you.

236
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,200
For her, you left me here alone.

237
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,200
Did you say that you only like me?

238
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,900
Are you even jealous of other women?

239
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,700
Do you plan to be the king of jealousy?

240
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,800
I remember you also quite like her, don't you?

241
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,300
You have so many of her albums at home.

242
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,000
So you wanted to play cool and didn't go in with me to get her photo.

243
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,160
Now you're jealous of me, huh?

244
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,260
I can see my boyfriend every day. But as for Song Lelanâ€¦

245
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,540
I might only have this one chance to be so close to her in my entire life.

246
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,999
You can understand that, right?

247
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:39,720
Not really.

248
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,579
You're so unreasonable.

249
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:46,499
I am unreasonable. You didn't just realize that, did you?

250
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,800
 Who am I that he would choose to stand by my side after facing my deception and lies? 

251
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,739
 As Shanshan said, I'm the one at fault. 

252
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:10,939
 I was forgiven so easily without paying any price. 

253
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:18,060
 Could there be a day when Shi Yan changes his mind and wants to make corrections? 

254
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,700
What's wrong with you today?

255
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Nothing.

256
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,459
You don't want to tell me?

257
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,100
It's not like that.

258
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,740
I'm just feeling a bit happy and a bit scared.

259
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,400
Scared of what?

260
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,659
Scared that you're still angry.

261
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,599
I always feel you should take revenge on me.

262
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,459
For instance, play me, trick me into bed, and then cruelly dump me.

263
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,459
An eye for an eye.

264
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:22,546
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

265
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:26,720
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

266
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:33,440
â™«  To travel through this long time with you  â™«

267
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,799
- What are you doing? 
 - An eye for an eye.

268
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,140
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

269
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,245
Actually, I just want to sayâ€¦

270
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:46,459
Can you not deceive me?

271
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:49,284
It really feels really bad to be deceived.

272
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,040
This sounds hypocritical.

273
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,897
â™«  Gathering in the vast sky  â™«

274
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:03,300
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

275
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,959
Indeed, I want to trick you into bed.

276
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,820
Zheng Shuyi, do you think you're the only one who's hypocritical?

277
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:21,393
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

278
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:31,330
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

279
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,219
This is a bit too much.

280
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,040
It's just a kiss and it's already too much?

281
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,900
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

282
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,099
Shi Yan,

283
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,519
I thought a lot today.

284
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,659
Maybe I talked a bit much, but please be patient.

285
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,695
When have you ever talked less?

286
00:25:56,695 --> 00:26:01,919
â™«  No matter how this fate started  â™«

287
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,239
I really do like you.

288
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,540
I'm not faking my feelingsâ€¦

289
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:12,200
though I had exterior purposes to begin with.

290
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,960
Now I also don't know what to do.

291
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,640
Anyway, I really like you right now.

292
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,219
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

293
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,350
Then how will you prove it?

294
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,760
How can I prove it?

295
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,659
Should I dig out my heart to show you?

296
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:38,780
Yi Yang wants to acquire Le'an. Why don't you ask him to return Bruce to Le'an?

297
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,300
I can go ask him.

298
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,912
But I'm afraid as soon as I do, you'll tie me up and lock me at home.

299
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,379
Then you can't prove it.

300
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:57,018
â™«  Gathering in the vast sky  â™«

301
00:26:57,018 --> 00:27:00,820
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

302
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,259
Zheng Shuyi, whatever happened is all behind me now.

303
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:09,739
So it should be behind you too. Do you get it?

304
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,920
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

305
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,000
You're my girlfriend. And no one can change that.

306
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,300
You are the girlfriend I want.

307
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,620
There's no other reasons. I'm not faking anything.

308
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,819
We're no different from other couples.

309
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:30,019
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

310
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,200
There's still a difference.

311
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,979
Other boyfriends don't call their girlfriends by their full names.

312
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:43,140
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

313
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,100
Got it.

314
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,642
Yiyi.

315
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,559
Rest early. I'm leaving.

316
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:04,654
â™«  We will run forward with all of our might, shining brightly  â™«

317
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,790
   

318
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,500
Where is he?

319
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,920
Mr. Shi didn't tell me.

320
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Where are you?

321
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,700
Where is my boyfriend?

322
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,999
Where can I find him?

323
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,820
Is he here? No.

324
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,640
How about this corner? Still, no.

325
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,780
Where did you go?

326
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,259
Why are you here?

327
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:12,159
Where else should I be?

328
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,860
Over there?

329
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,200
Now that you've found your boyfriend, why are you standing here gawking?

330
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,039
Why didn't you make a sound while standing behind me?

331
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,799
Interrupting the show is disrespectful to the actors.

332
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,980
This is basic viewing etiquette. Haven't you seen a play before?

333
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,960
No, I haven't.

334
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,100
Then I'll take you to one next time.

335
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,319
Get in the car.

336
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,070
   

337
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,459
Where on earth did you go just now?

338
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,120
You brought this for me!

339
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,619
How did you know I like to drink this?

340
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,559
How much do you like it?

341
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,680
To the point thatâ€¦ Even if you betrayed me,

342
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,679
I could immediately forgive you as long as you buy me one of these.

343
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,339
- Do you want a sip? 
 - No.

344
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,620
Let's not take this car next time. Okay?

345
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,840
Why? Don't you like this car?

346
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,419
I don't like it anymore.

347
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,300
But I like this car.

348
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,219
What's this?

349
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,700
A make-up gift for you.

350
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,160
â™«  Unyielding and stubborn mouth  â™«

351
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,440
Just one gift?

352
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,540
â™«  No sooner or later, waiting for a hug  â™«

353
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:40,157
 We should have spent New Year's Day and Spring Festival together. 

354
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:44,861
â™«  Unknowingly, I have become familiar with your taste  â™«

355
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:49,631
â™«  Neither cold nor hot, relying on a constant warmth  â™«

356
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:54,429
â™«  Quietly, controlled the pace  â™«

357
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:59,440
â™«  Not too close, not too far. The distance is just right  â™«

358
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,119
Your delivery.

359
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,300
Come.

360
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,640
"My Dear Honey."

361
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,946
There are a few more deliveries outside for you.

362
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:16,174
â™«  That your heartbeat was so panicked that you threw off your guard  â™«

363
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:21,380
â™«  Baby, don't make any noise, just hold my hands tightly  â™«

364
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,319
Did you receive it?

365
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,540
 - Why so many?  
 - They are all make-up gifts for you.

366
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,659
I was just teasing you.

367
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,099
What do you want to eat tonight?

368
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:32,619
 Hotpot. 

369
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,319
 Forget it. You don't like hotpot. 

370
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,339
Let's go to Savory Noodles. I haven't dined there for a while.

371
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,760
- Okay. 
  - Then I'm off to work. See you after work. 

372
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,500
Okay.

373
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,590
â™«  And you are also responsible for my cloudiness and sunshine  â™«

374
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,717
â™«  I just want to say that you in my heart are like sunshine and air  â™«

375
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,620
â™«  Even if you're elusive, you're never far away  â™«

376
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,240
- Please wait a moment. 
 - Thank you.

377
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,800
I'll just go to the restroom.

378
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,343
â™«  Let the warm air of love transform into raindrops  â™«

379
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:09,380
Ah, sorry! Sorry!

380
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,519
I am really sorry.

381
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,900
I just lost my balance. I didn't bump into you, did I?

382
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,880
No.

383
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,619
Your outfit is dirty. Let me have it washed for you.

384
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:24,240
My apologies.

385
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,600
It's okay. No worries.

386
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,720
Should I compensate you with a new one?

387
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,120
Let's follow each other on WeChat. I'll buy you a new one. I'm really sorry.

388
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,599
 He's flirting with someone? 

389
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,800
There's no need.

390
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
I really should compensate you.

391
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Otherwiseâ€¦ I'd feel bad.

392
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,100
I said there's no need for compensation.

393
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,900
If you really want to be here, could you please move over?

394
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,400
You've been blocking my girlfriend for quite a while.

395
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,400
Why don't you let her compensate? This outfit's super expensive.

396
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,000
If she wants to compensate, let her.

397
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Shuyi.

398
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What's up?

399
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,800
Though you look cute when you're jealous,

400
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,200
- Who said I'm jealous? 
- ...but I can't bear to see you jealous.

401
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,900
Don't talk nonsense. I'm not jealous.

402
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm just upset about your outfit. It's such a nice outfit.

403
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,700
What a shame.

404
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,800
- Hello? 
  - Hello? 

405
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,400
 What are you doing? 

406
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm eating out.

407
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,700
- Thank you. 
  - Are you eating with Shiyue? 

408
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,600
- I'm not with her. 
  - Do you know where she is? 

409
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,800
 No one's home and she's not replying to messages. 

410
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,500
I have no idea.

411
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,700
 Who are you with? 

412
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,000
My girlfriend.

413
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,800
Who are you calling?

414
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,500
My sister.

415
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,400
Do you want to say hello to my sister?

416
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,400
What? You don't want to greet my sister?

417
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,600
Okay, that's it for now.

418
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,100
Speaking of your sister,

419
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
how come I've never heard of her nor seen her?

420
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,200
Doesn't she work at Mingyu?

421
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,700
Why are you laughing?

422
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,700
Nothing. She just likes to keep a low profile.

423
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,000
But for the call just now, I would've almost forgotten that you even had a sister.

424
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's too low-key.

425
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,800
Then, do you want to meet my sister sometime?

426
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,000
Okay.

427
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,700
But there's no rush. Right? I need to prepare myself.

428
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,400
There's no rush. Take your time.

429
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,000
Since your sister doesn't work at Mingyu, what does she do?

430
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,200
My sister? She just sings and dances every day. That's all.

431
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,300
What a comfortable life!

432
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,200
Do you look like her?

433
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,700
We do look quite alike.

434
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,200
Show me her picture. I'm curious.

435
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Let me see.

436
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,500
I don't have her photo in my phone.

437
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,800
Who are you fooling?

438
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,100
I'm not. Check for yourself. The password is your birthday.

439
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,000
Never mind.

440
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,600
It's fine you don't show me. I'll meet her sooner or later anyway.

441
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,000
Mr. Yi, Dark Horse just entered the domestic market and it lacks experience.

442
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Le'an Tech, on the other hand has been in this market for many years.

443
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,000
- As a core member of Le'an Tech, I can definitely help youâ€¦ 
 - That's enough.

444
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,500
Do you have anything else to say?

445
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,200
Le'an Tech has been collaborating with Li Xuecai and his lab.

446
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,600
I have some advice for you.

447
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Yes.

448
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,700
Stop embarrassing the University of Finance and Economics.

449
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,000
Leave the chip industry as soon as possible.

450
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,900
This is good, Shiyue. You're making fast progress.

451
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,500
Because my auntie is a marvelous teacher.

452
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,200
My uncle even asked me to learn more from you.

453
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,000
I guess now he thinks a financial reporter is the best profession.

454
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,300
But he also emphasized learning what's good from you, not what's bad.

455
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,100
What's bad about me? Let him explain.

456
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,800
Did you really delete each other's contact information? Go ask him yourself.

457
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,400
Jingjing said the Chief Editor informed her of this.

458
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
She talked to Qin Shiyue.

459
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,200
Seems Shiyue's uncle is indeed working at Mingyu.

460
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,600
Is it Mingyu or Mingyu Cloud Innovation?

461
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,600
I don't know.

462
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,600
But I heard she knows Cloud Innovation's Financial Director well.

463
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,500
Just for the record, I'm not prying into your privacy.

464
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,400
We are friends after all.

465
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,900
You were in a bad state recently and even cried at the office.

466
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,100
You had a breakup then. Right?

467
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,900
Sort of.

468
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,300
Now you have a boyfriend again?

469
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,900
Why? Are there any rumors in the office.

470
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,600
Such rumors are quite usual in the office.

471
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:52,600
They say that you're dating an impressive boyfriend.

472
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,400
 My boyfriend is quite impressive. 

473
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
Yeah, so?

474
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,200
It's nothing.

475
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,700
It's just thatâ€¦ your boyfriend is quite old.

476
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,600
Don't be mad.

477
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,600
Just tell me privately is it true or not?

478
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,400
I've said it so many times.

479
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,300
If I had such intentions, why would I wait until now?

480
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,600
My boyfriend is not old. He's just called "uncle" in his family.

481
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Okay. It's okay that you don't want to tell me your about private matters.

482
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,500
I just want to remind you. Misunderstandings will always be cleared up.

483
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,800
If you've done nothing wrong, there's no need to fear rumors.

484
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,400
What did the Chief Editor say to you? Was it about your boyfriend?

485
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,500
How do even you know? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

486
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Let me show you something.

487
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,000
 Guess what I heard today. 

488
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,500
 You know the intern named Qin Shiyue. Right? 

489
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,200
 Zheng Shuyi with her uncle. 

490
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,700
 Qin's in her twenties, so her uncle must be around my dad's age. 

491
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,700
 That's what they say "you get resources by paying a price." 

492
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,800
 That's a huge price for ordinary people. 

493
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,500
Where did you get this?

494
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,500
It's everywhere. You can't see what's going on now?

495
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,480
Xu Yuling's spreading this in every chat group.

496
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,200
   

497
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,200
What's up?

498
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,000
Nothing. I just wanted to talk to you about my boyfriend.

499
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,700
Boyfriend?

500
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,800
What? You don't know about my boyfriend?

501
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
No, I don't.

502
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,800
You don't know about my boyfriend. And you're spreading rumors?

503
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,300
Don't talk nonsense. I've never seen your boyfriend. What rumors can I spread?

504
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:17,500
Right. Since you've never seen my boyfriend, you invented an old man up.

505
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,200
Xu Yuling.

506
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,800
We're colleagues after all.

507
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,400
Competition is normal, but I've never played any dirty tricks.

508
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,500
And you? You copied my outline and stole my interviews.

509
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,800
Now you're spreading rumors to ruin my reputation. Is it necessary?

510
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,000
Do you think your career can take off without me?

511
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,100
But you were no better than you are now before I joined the company.

512
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,400
Or are you just simply jealous of me?

513
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,100
Stop with your ungrounded accusations. Who's spreading rumors?

514
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,300
Yes. We don't get along. That's true.

515
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,600
But everyone's talking about your affair.

516
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,300
What makes you think it was me who said it?

517
