 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:32,129
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:34,654
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:38,629
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,229
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:45,954
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:48,354
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:50,740
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,979
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,054
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,229
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,654
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:06,479
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,514
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:12,974
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:16,429
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:20,079
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,304
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,454 --> 00:01:35,954
   

21
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:39,040
   

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,699
If I had known, I wouldn't have driven today.

23
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:55,000
This way Yu You could've taken me home.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,879
We could've spent time together for a little while longer.

25
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,899
Next time I see him, I definitely won't drive.

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,699
I can't believe I still have to work overtime on the weekend.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,120
But with you, it's a date anywhere.

28
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,619
Are you cold? Do you want to get in the car?

29
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:24,920
No.

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,160
You won't be able to hold me in the car.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,139
Your arms are the warmest place in the world.

32
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,419
How long have you been waiting for me today?

33
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:44,380
Tell me! Why are you here all of a sudden?

34
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,539
Zheng Shuyi.

35
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:50,280
Why are you asking so many questions at this point?

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,459
Can't I know?

37
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,379
I thought as a girlfriend I could learn everything about you.

38
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,299
Isn't that the privilege of being in love?

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,860
Yes, it is.

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,520
Iâ€¦

41
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,280
It's my mom.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,900
It's cold outside. Go home and answer it.

43
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,960
Okay.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,180
 Shuyi, what took you so long? 

45
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,780
 How are you today? 

46
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,000
It's been a great day.

47
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,679
Shuyi,

48
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,860
I know what girls your age are thinking.

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,140
You only fix your eyes on handsome internet celebrities.

50
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,980
 You spend money and time for them. 

51
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,439
 In the end, you get so caught up and can't stand the boys around you. 

52
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,759
How many dating opportunities have been missed for nothing?

53
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,280
It's a shame, isn't it?

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
Yu You is great.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,460
You've got to get to know each other better, you hear me?

56
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,739
I didn't say he's bad. What's your hurry?

57
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,399
 I'm not in a hurry. 

58
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,380
I'm just trying to talk to you.

59
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,260
So that you don't get any of those fanciful ideas.

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,979
Mom, I'm done talking to you. I'm going to take a shower.

61
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,419
 Wait. 

62
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,000
I've just spoken to Dr. Chen.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,079
She's very supportive of you two, too.

64
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,680
You two have to go to that exhibition this weekend.

65
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:37,839
We'll see.

66
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,619
I'm going to take off my makeup.

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,120
My makeup today is bland.

68
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Professor Yu, I've already booked the tickets for the exhibition.

69
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,720
 Thank you. How much are the tickets? I'll transfer it to you. 

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Even his punctuation seems polite.

71
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,120
- Uncle. 
 - Shiyue, you're back.

72
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,520
Uncle, did you have a good day?

73
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,100
Tell me all about it.

74
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,859
Kids should mind their own business.

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,499
Uncle, you have lipstick on your mouth.

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,939
It's late. Go to bed early or you'll turn into a panda with dark circles.

77
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,619
I teased him, and he joked with me.

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,000
Uncle, what's going on here?

79
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,939
Good morning, Shiyue.

80
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,100
Good morning, Shiyue.

81
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,959
 Did anything good happen yesterday? 

82
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,379
 Why is everyone so happy? 

83
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,960
Hello. This is your blanket.

84
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,022
   

85
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,940
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

86
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,859
Nannan, what's wrong with you?

87
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,839
Ugh, I had a leak at home last night. I was up all night.

88
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,439
So, is it fixed now?

89
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,300
It's been inspected. It needs to be redecorated.

90
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,260
I don't have a place to stay in now.

91
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,140
I have to look for one after work.

92
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,700
Didn't you read my post last night?

93
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,020
Last night?

94
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,100
Nâ€¦ No.

95
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,759
You're wearing eyeliner.

96
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,799
I refreshed it a bit today on a whim.

97
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,940
My eyeliner will expire if I don't use it soon.

98
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,584
That's not it.

99
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:58,759
What's "not it"?

100
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,039
It's more than just eyeliner.

101
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,605
And this rouge and your lips.

102
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,060
Hello, Mr. Chen.

103
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
The average age of Juhe's team members is way too young.

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,059
And its size isn't impressive.

105
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,179
Yu You, do you need to revise your report?

106
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,419
Otherwise the old menwill say we're just fooling around.

107
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,779
Shi Yan, what do you think?

108
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,380
Take a look for me.

109
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,523
Is he smiling?

110
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,340
That's a little creepy.

111
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:47,859
He seems to be in a good mood today.

112
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,440
What are you looking at me for?

113
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,820
Have you read the report? Anything to add?

114
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,479
Playing cool, huh?

115
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:02,039
Shouldn't you be the one to share with us your happy experience?

116
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,814
Yeah, something good happened.

117
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:07,480
Juhe is young and energetic.

118
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,080
They want to upgrade their technology.

119
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,879
They have a clear division of labor among the management team.

120
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,879
I think highly of them.

121
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,600
And judging from this report, its valuation is very reasonable.

122
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,559
We're getting a great deal if we invest in them now.

123
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,399
Shouldn't I be happy about it?

124
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,840
That's it?

125
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,240
How can that be?

126
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,879
You believe him?

127
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,440
 Have you eaten? 

128
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,779
 I'm eating a luxurious meal. 

129
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,799
 My girlfriend isn't enjoying a fancy meal. 

130
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,799
 What about my boyfriend? Can he bring me a fancy meal? 

131
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,025
 Sure. 

132
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,600
 Shuyi, I'm a little busy tonight. I'll make it up to you this weekend. 

133
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,600
 Shuyi, I'm a little busy tonight. I'll make it up to you this weekend. 

134
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,859
Okay, I'll wait for you.

135
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,600
Shuyi.

136
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,839
Are you messaging Professor Yu?

137
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,060
What are you talking about?

138
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,879
Shiyue, I need to talk to you for the record.

139
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,180
I only admire Yu You as a friend but I have no other feelings for him.

140
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,019
Shuyi, I have something to tell you.

141
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,360
Go on.

142
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,379
I think I gave you some bad advice last time.

143
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,459
- You and Professor Yu are the same. 
 - The same?

144
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:16,639
Yeah, that's right.

145
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,440
Have you ever heard that "Likes repel and opposites attract?"

146
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,010
You two are too much alike.

147
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,650
You don't complement each other and can't be a match.

148
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:29,420
What kind of person do you think I'd be good with?

149
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,520
That "Uncle."

150
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,679
You really think so, too?

151
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,147
Of course, you two have complementary personalities, ages, and careers.

152
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:42,146
It all adds up!

153
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:50,400
According to you, Yu You and you would be a good match.

154
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,340
Yeah, we would!

155
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,779
Shuyi, you think so too?

156
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,980
Want some?

157
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,679
No. No need.

158
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,420
I'm meeting someone.

159
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,720
Let's have dinner, shall we?

160
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,619
I need to talk to you.

161
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,340
Shanshan.

162
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,140
We'll be going now.

163
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,840
Bye.

164
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,320
Let's get in the car first.

165
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,240
They're for you.

166
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,420
Thank you.

167
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,539
Ms. Kong, I went to college with a local who just happened to have a flat for rent.

168
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,679
It's also close to your agency.

169
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,500
I saw your post.

170
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,979
So I thought I could help out.

171
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:25,820
That's great. You're doing me a big favor.

172
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,779
Don't call me "Ms. Kong." It's too formal. I told you to call me Sister Nan.

173
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,299
Nanâ€¦

174
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:33,959
Nanâ€¦

175
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,860
If you can't, you can call me "Kong Nan."

176
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,399
Kong Nan.

177
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,260
This is a new neighborhood, isn't it? Will it be expensive?

178
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,459
I asked him before we came.

179
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,600
The rent's about the same as your old one.

180
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,559
If you're interested, I can check with my classmate again.

181
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,080
Oh, sure.

182
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,639
How do you like it? Is it good?

183
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,039
I can't be more satisfied.

184
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,320
But the rentâ€¦

185
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't worry about that.

186
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,900
Chen Sheng has been nagging me all day.

187
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,020
I definitely have to help him outâ€¦

188
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,679
Thank you for today.

189
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,100
No problem.

190
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,559
Well, if there's nothing else.

191
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,460
I'm going home now.

192
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,675
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

193
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Chen Sheng!

194
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,279
Todayâ€¦

195
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,000
Ms. Kong, don't take what my classmate just said to heart.

196
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He used to make fun of me when we were in college.

197
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,119
So you're saying you're not interested in me?

198
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,579
That's not what I mean.

199
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,900
I mean, I'mâ€¦ youâ€¦

200
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,519
You're a grown-up. Can't you just be a little bit straightforward?

201
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,080
Yes or no?

202
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,079
Yes, a little.

203
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,120
How much is a little?

204
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,860
I just think you're nice.

205
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,820
I want to see if there's a chance.

206
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,200
A chance for what?

207
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,420
A chance to develop a relationship with you.

208
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,360
I was just thinking about it.

209
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,799
If you don't want toâ€¦

210
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,059
Then you should really think about it carefully.

211
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,220
You know, I'm five years older than you.

212
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,679
By July of this year, I'll be 30 years old.

213
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,100
My mom's been pushing me to get married, too.

214
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,079
So, I don't even have time to play with a little kid.

215
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,100
I got it.

216
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,415
Soâ€¦

217
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:58,200
if you want to pursue me, you have to be serious.

218
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,039
and think about the future and get ready to get married.

219
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,679
Don't waste your time.

220
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,759
And don't waste my time.

221
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,679
Do you understand me?

222
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,039
Yes, I do.

223
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,839
I give you my word.

224
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:17,139
So, do you have plans later today?

225
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,859
Why don't we eat together?

226
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,717
 Have you eaten? 

227
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,279
 Shi Yan, you're so clingy. 

228
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,880
 I'm eating. It's my turn to ask you. 

229
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,839
 Have you eaten yet? 

230
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,300
 Not yet. 

231
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,859
Mr. Shi, your takeout.

232
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,540
 Did you get the takeout? 

233
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,499
Why haven't you eaten yet?

234
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,580
 I'm just waiting for you to join me. 

235
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,960
 See if you like it. 

236
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,599
Shuyi,

237
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,459
thank you.

238
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,577
Don't be so polite.

239
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,259
If you want to thank me,

240
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,740
 don't leave a single grain of rice. 

241
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,480
 Forget it. You don't have to stuff yourself. 

242
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,960
Anyway, I'm hanging up. Eat up. Bye.

243
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,959
Don't sit down to work right after you eat. Get up and move a bit. Okay?

244
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,099
What do you want to tell me?

245
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:41,919
I want to askâ€¦ if you have time to ride this week?

246
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,680
No, I don't.

247
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,000
If you don't have time this week, what about next week?

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,179
I'm busy next week.

249
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,179
What about the week after next week?

250
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
What are you trying to say?

251
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,900
I actually wanted to askâ€¦

252
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,040
Can we do more things like, you know... dinner, horseback riding,

253
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,060
movies, and things like that?

254
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,640
And then?

255
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,699
Guan Ji,

256
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:48,419
actually, you can enjoy dinner, horseback riding, and movies with many different people.

257
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:57,300
Have you thought about how we should define our roles in doing these things together?

258
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
I'm done.

259
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,720
Thanks for dinner.

260
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,600
I'll go home first.

261
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:29,680
No need to send me home.

262
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,899
I can call my own cab.

263
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:48,680
If you have time, you should think about what you want.

264
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm home. Get some rest.

265
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,300
Good night.

266
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,400
Uncle, you're back.

267
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,359
What are you doing?

268
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,219
Doing my homework.

269
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,720
Your leader taught you well.

270
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,759
Do your homework and go to bed early.

271
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,540
What did my leader teach me?

272
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:55,226
   

273
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,720
Shuyi, you have a visitor today.

274
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,000
I've got him waiting for you in the conference room.

275
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,660
Is that the boy from earlier?

276
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,400
Who is it?

277
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,441
 It's him? 

278
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,000
Hi. I'm Yi Yang.

279
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,459
Mr. Yi, hello. I'm Zheng Shuyi.

280
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,219
You asked for me?

281
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:49,040
Ms. Zheng, I'd like to ask you to do an interview like this.

282
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,720
We can settle this today.

283
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,779
Then schedule a time when you give me the outline for the interview,

284
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,620
I'll make preparations.

285
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,119
By the way, I have one more request.

286
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,900
I'm going to put this interview in the Financial Introduce's e-version.

287
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,780
Mr. Yi, look, my time is probably next week.

288
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,239
I can wait.

289
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,980
I don't know what you do, or where you work.

290
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,259
Good. You're starting to want to get to know me.

291
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,100
In order for you to know me better, how about this?

292
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,440
There's a live launch on Friday at 3:00 p.m.

293
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,680
I'm inviting you to be the only media party.

294
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,380
Mr. Yi, you've just seen my schedule.

295
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm still hoping you'll make some time to attend.

296
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,140
This will help you get to know your prospective interviewee faster and better.

297
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,559
What's your WeChat number?

298
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,440
I'll send you the address later.

299
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Why did he ask for you?

300
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,379
He said his name was Yi Yang and wanted me to write an article for him.

301
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,660
He seems delusional.

302
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,580
It could be a scam. You need to be careful.

303
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,300
Yeah, it could be.

304
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,479
Why don't you tell Youran not to let him in next time?

305
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,559
But when we were alone, he didn't do anything weird.

306
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,319
What if he's a well-disguised psychopath?

307
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,160
You didn't give him your personal information, did you?

308
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,720
Shuyi, I'm going to class.

309
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:57,937
   

310
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:07,480
Did you graduate from college?

311
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,540
   

312
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:23,240
I don't think any of them are the Yi Yang I met.

313
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:29,780
What's this live launch? There's no news at all.

314
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:33,960
Is he really aâ€¦?

315
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,899
Hi, there's no one here. Come sit here.

316
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,979
Thank you.

317
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:43,039
Don't mention it.

318
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,759
Professor Yu's class is crowded.

319
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,400
I always see you in class.

320
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,119
So I thought I'd find a seat for you.

321
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:53,180
By the way, I'm a sophomore finance major.

322
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,759
My name is Qian Yucheng.

323
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,160
Hello.

324
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,359
I notice that you come to this class every week.

325
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,599
But I haven't seen you in any of other classes.

326
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,039
You areâ€¦?

327
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,839
I'm not a student at the University of Finance and Economics.

328
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm interning at Financial Introduce.

329
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,200
I've come to listen to Professor Yu's class. I want to enrich my mind.

330
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,840
I see.

331
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,139
You're a reporter?

332
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,699
Weâ€¦

333
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,775
- Hello, students. 
  - Hello, professor. 

334
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,319
Let's start today's lesson.

335
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,140
Today, I'm going to teach you about market risk measurement.

336
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,880
Please open your textbooks.

337
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,599
We focus on what risk measurement is.

338
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,559
The we look into the methods of measuring market risks.

339
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,979
Yucheng which page should I go to?

340
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,640
Not this page. This is the one.

341
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,680
So the partial valuation method is the simplest one in the whole V2 calculation.

342
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:08,060
Of course, except for the partial valuation method

343
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,379
historical simulation is also a very important method.

344
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,259
Thank you so much for today.

345
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,039
You've thanked me many times.

346
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,519
It's hard to find a seat when you're off-campus.

347
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,240
How about this?

348
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,200
I'll get a seat for you next time.

349
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
Really?

350
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,520
Thank you so much.

351
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,019
I'll invite you for a meal sometime.

352
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:33,559
Sounds good.

353
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,340
Where is he?

354
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,419
He left so fast.

355
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:54,319
Shuyi, you're not working late today, are you?

356
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm going to work late a bit.

357
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:05,159
Nannan, I can't believe you're wearing full makeup today.

358
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,720
Tell me what's going on?

359
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,659
There's nothing going on.

360
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:12,780
I have to sign the contract later.

361
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,920
Contract?

362
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,160
You've found a flat?

363
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,079
Yeah, my friend found it for me.

364
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,559
Then I'm leaving.

365
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,000
See you tomorrow. Bye.

366
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,559
See you tomorrow.

367
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,735
 Will you be working overtime today? 

368
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:46,262
 Yeah. 

369
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:49,400
 Then go for it. 

370
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,279
 I'm working overtime, too. 

371
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,079
 Let's work together across space and get things down quickly. 

372
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,540
 I'll see you on the weekend when we're done these few days. 

373
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,540
 I look forward to it. 

374
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,800
 Okay, I'll see you this weekend. 

375
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,910
   

376
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:37,839
I'm starving. What should I eat?

377
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,899
- Hello. 
  - Hello, is this Zheng Shuyi? 

378
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:46,759
 Your meal is here. 

379
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,580
   

380
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,779
Ms. Zheng, your takeout.

381
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:56,100
The food is still hot, and there's no spillage.

382
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,079
Your boyfriend placed the order, didn't he?

383
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,319
Your boyfriend is very attentive.

384
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,279
He talked over the phone for ten minutes.

385
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,259
He showed me where to buy a thermos and how to get the noodles out of the store.

386
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,259
Running this errand is like being a thief. It's quite a hassle.

387
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:10,559
Eat it while it's hot.

388
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,880
By the way, please tell him to give me a good review.

389
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,562
Thank you.

390
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,359
There's no green onion. You're so careful.

391
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,459
 Thanks for the special love delivery. 

392
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:43,479
 I like it. 

393
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:46,440
 But I still want to eat with you. 

394
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,440
   

395
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,700
No. 18, Wanxing Road?

396
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,400
What? No. 18, Wanxing Road?

397
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,520
    
 Isn't it near the science park?

398
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,460
Yi Yang?

399
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,359
You're not really going, are you?

400
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,820
It's a little remote.

401
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,820
Ms. Zheng!

402
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,299
- Mr. Yi. 
 - You're here.

403
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,480
The broadcast hasn't started yet. I'll give you a tour.

404
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,340
Then I'll have to trouble you.

405
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,140
That's about it for the company.

406
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,839
We just set things up here. It's still new.

407
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,519
So, you're just starting out? But last timeâ€¦

408
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,140
It's about time.

409
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,419
Ms. Zheng, your questions will be answered soon.

410
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,480
You're doing live-streaming here?

411
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,960
Yeah, that's right.

412
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,340
When I was abroad, I had my own video channel. I often live-streamed on it.

413
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,999
I shared my research and some of the fun things in my life.

414
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:52,100
The opening ceremony at home is a bit over the top.

415
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,039
That's why I'd like to do this broadcast as my opening ceremony.

416
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,479
This way, more people can see it.

417
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:01,079
I'll continue to share my life and work on the air.

418
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,779
Did you really invite only me?

419
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,319
Yep.

420
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,360
Please be seated.

421
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,900
Hello, everyone. I'm Yi Yang, Jackson Yi.

422
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,700
I'm so happy to be able to share the opening of my company on live TV.

423
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,079
 Jackson Yi? Why does this name sound so familiar? 

424
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,159
 JY, chip genius. 

425
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,740
 He became interested in semiconductors at the age of 14. 

426
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,360
 After obtaining his Bachelor's Degree, he went on to pursue a Doctorate Degree. 

427
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,639
 He started a business with his classmates when he was in college. 

428
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,599
 He earned his first bucket of gold with a few researches of his own. 

429
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,920
I've always had a passionate relationship with challenges.

430
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,679
Challenging and being challenged have always been a source of joy in my life.

431
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,599
And they motivate me to improve.

432
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,559
I'm lucky. I've got a lot of like-minded friends on my way to challenges.

433
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,039
I'm lucky. I've got a lot of like-minded friends on my way to challenges.

434
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,839
Our challenge this time is Black Horse Technology.

435
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,979
And joining me in this challenge is my good partner, Bruce.

436
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,960
Next, let's give the floor to my partner, Bruce.

437
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,679
Shi Yan.

438
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,580
Don't look at me. Look at your cell phone.

439
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,330
 â€¦give the floor to my partner, Bruce. 

440
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,119
 JY is a very good friend of mine. 

441
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,340
 We're confident that we can lead our technical team 

442
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,020
to develop a chip with better performance.

443
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,840
 And take the industry to the next level. 

444
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,579
What does Bruce mean? And this one. Who's Jackson Yi?

445
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,119
What does Bruce mean? And this one. Who's Jackson Yi?

446
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,980
Can someone please explain to me what's going on?

447
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,840
You don't know, do you?

448
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,360
I don't.

449
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,539
 Shi Yan, take a look. What's your plan? 

450
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,760
 I'll talk to Bruce. 

451
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,480
Let's go to Le'an Tech and talk to Chen Kang.

452
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,220
 Mr. Shi, Bruce left Le'an Tech. 

453
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,499
 He joined a chip company called Black Horse Technology. 

454
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:36,440
I already know.

455
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,230
If he leaves now, Le'an Tech will be in trouble.

456
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,410
Uncle Tian and the others won't let you go.

457
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:44,159
Mr. Shi, Mr. Tian wants to meet with you in half an hour.

458
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:54,024
   

459
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,260
Thanks, guys.

460
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,480
Bruce.

461
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,840
This is Ms. Zheng Shuyi from Financial Introduce.

462
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,280
She's my special guest today.

463
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,339
How are you? Very nice to meet you, Ms. Zheng.

464
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,559
I have to take this, sorry.

465
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,859
Hello, Yu.

466
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:29,000
Bruce, I think we should talk.

467
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,520
 I'm really sorry. I've made my decision. 

468
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,300
 I hope you're okay with that. 

469
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,479
Bruce, Cloud Innovation and Shi Yan have shown you 100% sincerity.

470
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,459
 Le'an Tech needs you, too. 

471
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:42,680
 You have been doing so well. 

472
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,950
Shi Yan is actually very good. Le'an Tech is also very professional.

473
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,260
 But I've known JY for years. 

474
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,860
 We share a common vision. 

475
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,380
Besides, he's a genius in his field.

476
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,039
With him, I have more possibilities.

477
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,199
 I hope you understand. I'm sorry. 

478
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,499
Thank you for coming all the way to witness our opening ceremony.

479
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:11,000
Congratulations, Mr. Yi.

480
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,119
I'll wait for you to schedule an interview.

481
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,599
Mr. Yi.

482
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,260
I may have to go back and think about it before getting back to you.

483
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,100
Okay.

484
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,380
Just call me Yi Yang.

485
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,360
If there's nothing else, I'll go.

486
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Do you need a ride?

487
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,570
No, I called a cab.

488
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,980
   

489
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,239
 Did you see Black Horse Technology's live broadcast? 

490
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,400
 What happened to Le'an Tech? 

491
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,580
 Shi Yan, how are you doing over there? 

492
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,259
Let's go to Mingyu Cloud Innovation instead. I'm sorry.

493
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,280
Ms. Zheng, what are you doing here?

494
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,760
Mr. Chen, I'm sorry. Could you please take me to Mr. Shi? It's urgent.

495
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,619
Mr. Chen, I'm sorry. Could you please take me to Mr. Shi? It's urgent.

496
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,019
Don't you have an appointment with Mr. Shi?

497
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:06,440
He just left ten minutes ago.

498
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,800
 Uncle, I'll be at the mansion tonight doing some research, so I won't be coming back. 

499
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,433
 Shi Yan, I'm coming for you. 

500
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:58,776
   
   

501
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,519
 I'm fine. Don't worry about me. 

502
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,619
Shi Yan.

503
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,459
Why did you come?

504
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:31,000
It's nothing. I just missed you.

505
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,820
You've been drinking.

506
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,480
Why didn't you call me over when you drink?

507
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,519
The Shi family's Yan is stingy!

508
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,919
I havenâ€™t forgotten it since I tasted it at your house last time.

509
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,519
I drank it all up.

510
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,419
I'm drooling over the one you're drinking right now.

511
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,280
Why don't you pour me a drink? I'll drink with you.

512
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,439
Sure.

513

 "Passerby" - Zhou Shen

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:47,770
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

516

â™«  Can a happy ending be fixed?  â™«
