00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,900
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,525
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

4
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,775
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,625
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

7
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,325
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

8
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,411
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

9
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

11
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,525
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

13
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:06,450
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,485
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

15
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

16
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,300
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,150
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

19
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:36,125
   

20
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,011
   

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,860
What are you so happy about?

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,181
Is it that obvious?

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,920
You've changed.

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,280
Now you know to return useless stuff.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,100
Return? Did I return anything?

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,639
That one.

27
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,720
I didn't return it. I think Shuyi returned it.

28
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,160
Zheng Shuyi?

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,539
Why did she return them?

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,020
This is what happened last time. I realized that I misunderstood her.

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,300
So I wanted to make it up to her and bought her some clothes.

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,400
She rejected them and said to return them.

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,700
I insisted on giving her the clothes.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,497
I didn't expect she'd return everything.

35
00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:42,419
 So she took the clothes to return them. 

36
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,560
You're spending a lot.

37
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,220
 You'reâ€¦ 

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,319
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

39
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,319
 Tomorrowâ€¦ 

40
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:06,360
â™«  To travel through this long time with you  â™«

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,840
But Shuyi really loves her job.

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,700
She was just notified yesterday and left for a business trip this morning.

43
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,080
To be honest, she writes outlines, interviews, and business trips by herself. Itâ€™s really hard.

44
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,279
I don't know where she gets the motivation.

45
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,040
She is on a business trip?

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,120
She left early this morning.

47
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,784
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

48
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:32,767
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

49
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,176
   

50
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:40,159
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

51
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,850
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

52
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,854
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

53
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:55,379
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

54
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,319
Good progress on the Le'an's side.

55
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,500
Everything is progressing in an orderly fashion.

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,500
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

57
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:12,382
â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

58
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,289
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

59
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:22,335
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

60
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:28,159
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

61
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,878
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

62
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:37,748
â™«  No matter how this fate arises  â™«

63
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:41,048
   

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,139
Shi Yan, is your cell phone broken?

65
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,340
Why haven't you contacted me?

66
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,720
I've posted so many fun things and lovely pictures.

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,879
No appreciation at all and no likes either.

68
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,879
 Which hotel are you staying in? Which room? 

69
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,260
Hi, sweetheart.

70
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,800
Why did you come?

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,959
I'm traveling for a colleague.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
I thought you didn't cover news in other cities.

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,100
And so many people are waiting for you.

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,059
Shanshan, is there something wrong with you?

75
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:39,539
Nothing.

76
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,573
I'm just too tired from playing. Can't I take a couple days off?

77
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:46,319
Why don't you find someone to settle down with?

78
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,560
Settling down for now is not real settling down.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,320
Some relationships are destined to fail even when they settle down.

80
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,959
Settling down like that is too dangerous for me.

81
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,480
Has Shi Yan contacted you?

82
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,999
No.

83
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,120
The cell phone costs thousands.

84
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,700
How come it doesn't even show his response?

85
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:42,539
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

86
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,360
Where are you?

87
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I'll see you at the usual place.

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,339
I'm not in Jiangcheng.

89
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,680
So when are you coming back?

90
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't know yet.

91
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,179
I have to go. My friend's asleep.

92
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,939
It's snowing, Shanshan.

93
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,260
It's really snowing.

94
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,920
The snow scene in Wu City is so beautiful.

95
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,879
You're having a good time, aren't you?

96
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,799
   

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,460
You're checking the lass you took to the riding club last time. Right?

98
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,700
Don't be so shy.

99
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,420
The girl's quite fun.

100
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,000
I haven't seen her lately.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
She's on a business trip.

102
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,679
I saw the article of her interview with you.

103
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,299
It's really good.

104
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,959
She's young, but her writing's sophisticated.

105
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,180
She's more insightful than many veteran journalists.

106
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,479
Her point is passable.

107
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,240
Really?

108
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,860
I thought you used to hate dealing with the press.

109
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,740
People have to change to adapt.

110
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,720
Cloud Innovation is on the rise now.

111
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,619
It needs the media to publicize itself.

112
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,859
That's good. Capital!

113
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:16,759
Next time, invite her over.

114
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,379
I need to talk to this reporter who's changed your mind.

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
I have to talk to her.

116
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
Come on in.

117
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,919
Move over.

118
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,019
Stand there.

119
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,420
Make a nice pose.

120
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,480
What is it?

121
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,620
Stop asking and just listen to me. Come on.

122
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,580
Okay, another pose.

123
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,119
Okay.

124
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,859
Why did you post it in my stead?

125
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,359
Is it good?

126
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,159
I can't even fine-tune it before I post it.

127
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,039
The picture's so beautiful.

128
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,520
My photography skills need no "fine-tuning".

129
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,540
Trust me, Shi Yan will contact you soon.

130
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,039
I think your idea is good.

131
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,080
But do consider outside opinions.

132
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,100
You can prove your ability sooner or later.

133
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,200
But before that, it wouldn't hurt to avoid direct confrontations.

134
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,859
Got it.

135
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,979
I know... these old guys.

136
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:57,639
They've all seen Mingyu at its best.

137
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,279
Whatever we did, we could make money.

138
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,919
So they had confidence.

139
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,639
During our crisis a few years ago,

140
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,000
they still cared and didn't sell the shares and sat watching us struggle.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,079
Now you're doing great with your business.

142
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,959
They're thinking about earning some money back.

143
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,600
They're not very patient.

144
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,840
But I don't think they have any bad intentions. I understand.

145
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,120
That's why I'm more concerned about the security of their investment.

146
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:43,100
 I heard that wishes made during the first snow will come true. 

147
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,840
 It's snowing, you should put on more clothes. 

148
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,940
 It looks like you're really having fun and you don't want to come back. 

149
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,899
Shanshan, you're great.

150
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,400
 When will you return to Jiangcheng? 

151
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,059
His cell phone is fixed.

152
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,879
Don't be silly.

153
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,819
That's a sign of missing you.

154
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:16,240
He misses you.

155
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,399
Hold your horses! Reply later.

156
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,240
What if he has a meeting later?

157
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,159
The meeting will end anyway.

158
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,639
Now that he's gotten back with you, don't pounce on the advantage the moment it appears.

159
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,839
It will make you appear too eager.

160
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,399
Be a bit aloof. Play hard to get.

161
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,819
He'll find you special and precious.

162
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,420
- So when do I reply to him? 
 - Wait for a bit.

163
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,779
Then what do I say?

164
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,979
You should sayâ€¦

165
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,860
"How do you know I'm not in Jiangcheng?"

166
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,240
Of course, he knows as he's seen my posts.

167
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,599
You have to get him to ask that question.

168
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:01,079
That's not going to work. You don't understand him.

169
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,459
He's immune to flirting.

170
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,139
Maybe he doesn't even like me playing hard to get.

171
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,479
Okay, I have an idea.

172
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,719
Judging from your response it's not that he's immune to flirting.

173
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:23,399
It's you who has a heart of stone.

174
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,879
 Uncle Guan wants to see you. 

175
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,960
Uncle Guan.

176
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
Which Uncle Guan?

177
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,160
Does it matter who Uncle Guan is?

178
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,180
Forget about "Uncle Guan" in that sentence.

179
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,100
The person who wants to see you is not Uncle Guan but CEO Shi Yan.

180
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,539
What a couple you two are.

181
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,340
You have the lamest flirting skills.

182
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,840
And it's just right for that most reserved man.

183
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,180
Shanshan,

184
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,200
this Uncle Guan is called Guan Xiangcheng.

185
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,860
Shi Yan calls him uncle.

186
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,739
Guan Xiangcheng?

187
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,340
 Mr. Shi, don't keep me in suspense. Tell me! 

188
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,659
   

189
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,639
 Uncle Guan would like to be interviewed by you. 

190
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:28,679
 Thank you, Boss! 

191
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,859
 You're the sweetest. 

192
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,439
 You can come back. 

193
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,779
 Okay, I'll be right back. 

194
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,679
I can interview Guan Xiangcheng.

195
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,700
On my! I'm not dreaming, am I?

196
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,039
That's Guan Xiangcheng!

197
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,000
I can interview the legendary figure.

198
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
Wait!

199
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,939
I didn't apply for an interview with him, did I?

200
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:01,039
That's why I said it was Shi Yan who wanted you to come back.

201
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,300
He must have missed you so much that he sent you a message out of the blue.

202
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,519
Uncle Guan.

203
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,399
That's just an excuse to get you back to Jiangcheng as soon as possible.

204
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,099
Excuse?

205
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,200
Well, I have to book a flight and make this interview happen.

206
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:23,640
Zheng Shuyi, have a bit of reserve, will you?

207
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,399
Shanshan, that's Guan Xiangcheng.

208
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,740
I can be reserved but my professionalism won't allow it.

209
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,340
I have an interview tomorrow.

210
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,979
I have to finish the outline today.

211
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:53,412
   

212
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,600
 I'm back. 

213
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,020
 Quite early. 

214
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,419
What is he suggesting?

215
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,559
Does he really think I've been away for too long?

216
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,000
He misses me.

217
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,560
He can't wait to see me.

218
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,700
It can't be. I'm overthinking it.

219
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,960
 See you later. 

220
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,080
Okay, I got it.

221
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,619
I have an interview with Ms. Zheng.

222
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:50,019
Yet you're here before anyone else.

223
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:53,020
I'm here for your great experience.

224
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,920
Naturally, I can't be late.

225
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,499
Okay, okay, I wonâ€™t expose you.

226
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,859
It's good to be young.

227
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,559
What's wrong?

228
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,799
We were hit by a car from behind.

229
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,899
Wait a minute.

230
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,120
- Is this how you drive? 
 - Is this how you drive?

231
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,079
Do you know how to drive?

232
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,559
I'm driving at a normal speed.

233
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,079
You hit me when you suddenly slowed down.

234
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,319
I drove normally, too.

235
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,279
I stopped because you hit me from behind.

236
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,620
All right, you two calm down.

237
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,379
Let's wait for the police and the insurance company's investigaâ€¦

238
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:52,659
Whatever, it's your fault. Whoever investigates the case won't make a difference.

239
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:54,800
 Uncle Guan is waiting for you. 

240
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

241
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,119
 My fault? Is it my fault? 

242
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,040
 - Whose fault do you think it is?  
  - The traffic's jammed. 

243
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,799
What's going on over there? 
  - My problem? 

244
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,219
I ran into a car accident. It's being dealt with.

245
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,919
You're not hurt, are you?

246
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,039
 I'm fine. 

247
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,640
 It's not my fault! 

248
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,499
Give me the address and I'll have Chen Sheng pick you up.

249
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:14,940
 Okay. 

250
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:18,759
 I'm rude? You're the one who's rude! 

251
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,699
- What's your name? 
 - Wang Zhong.

252
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,179
What about you?

253
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,979
Yang Feifan.

254
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,320
Chen Sheng, I'm sorry. Just give me a minute.

255
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,759
What are you doing here?

256
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,599
You're not hurt, are you?

257
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,439
I'm fine.

258
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,180
What are you doing?

259
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,499
This is a new energy vehicle. It seems to have a faulty battery.

260
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:48,419
Battery?

261
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,459
The car uses Zhanlan's battery.

262
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,620
Hasn't Zhanlan been raising money lately?

263
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,179
I've been following the news.

264
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,839
So I want to know more about it.

265
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,960
Maybe we'll get something out of it.

266
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,939
I'll go with you.

267
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,759
Officers.

268
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,039
Have there been many similar accidents with this new energy vehicle lately?

269
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,359
Not too many. There are a few cases.

270
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,060
Officers, may I ask whether the accident was related to the battery?

271
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,179
I'm not sure. We need professional tests to be sure.

272
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,920
You two are passengers, aren't you?

273
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,699
Now that it's taken care of if there's nothing else, you're free to go.

274
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:25,900
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

275
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,299
No problem.

276
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,340
Oh no, I'm late.

277
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,980
I forgot to tell Mr. Guan.

278
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,240
We've got to hurry. I don't want to keep him waiting.

279
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,339
Come on in.

280
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,380
Chief Editor.

281
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,119
What's wrong, Yuling?

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,560
Chief Editor, I contacted the vice presidents of three commercial banks.

283
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,500
They promised me that we could do an interview together.

284
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,259
Could you reserve this month's front page for me?

285
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,839
Three vice presidents doing an interview together.

286
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Great.

287
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,559
This is a front-page interview, for sure.

288
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,659
Thank you!

289
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,860
Yuling, you have always been the signature of our financial magazine.

290
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,720
You have impressive professional competence.

291
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,539
The lead editor and I think highly of you. Keep up the good work.

292
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:31,379
Thank you, Chief Editor. I'll get back to work.

293
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,400
 Ms. Yi, I'm not returning to the office today. 

294
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,039
 I'm interviewing Guan Xiangcheng today. 

295
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,799
Interview with Guan Xiangcheng.

296
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,599
I see. Go ahead.

297
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,139
Hello.

298
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,739
Aren't you working? Why are you calling me?

299
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:23,400
 Of course, itâ€™s because what I want to tell you is related to work. 

300
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,260
How can I confirm our financial agency without calling Mr. Guan personally?

301
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,960
Has she really invited you, the great Buddha, to come down the mountain?

302
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,160
Ms. Zheng told you that, didn't she?

303
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,480
I did ask her to come over today for a chat.

304
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,640
How did she get in touch with you.

305
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,699
I've read some of her great work.

306
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:49,599
She's such a sophisticated writer for such a young age.

307
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,620
 Her writing's so insightful and compelling. 

308
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,939
 It's almost unnervingly impressive. 

309
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,599
 So I had one of my nephews invite her over. 

310
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,599
I'm not surprised at all.

311
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,380
Shuyi is one of the best journalists we have here. I'm proud of her.

312
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,620
 She's perceptive and observant. 

313
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,500
 She can always find the right perspective and write compellingly. 

314
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,039
 I'm looking forward to this interview. 

315
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,079
You two are both looking forward to it.

316
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,660
But that leaves me in a big trouble.

317
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,659
Well, my apologies.

318
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,559
It's my fault for not telling you in advance.

319
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,880
I caused you trouble again, didn't I?

320
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,740
 I'll make it up to you in person tonight. 

321
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,300
I'll pick you up after work. Okay?

322
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,060
Don't bother. I'll go there myself tonight.

323
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,079
 I'll see you tonight. 

324
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,819
See you tonight.

325
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,720
Uncle Guan.

326
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,220
You're here.

327
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,119
Come on in.

328
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,980
- Have a seat. 
 - Hello, Mr. Guan.

329
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,439
Take a sit.

330
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,739
Ms. Zhengâ€¦

331
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,440
Oh, I should call you Report Zheng today.

332
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,379
Make yourself at home.

333
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:12,400
You can just call me Uncle Guan like Shi Yan.

334
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,659
Don't be a stranger.

335
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,959
Thank you.

336
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,779
Let's just chat casually today.

337
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:20,559
I read some of your pieces.

338
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,459
I think they're all good.

339
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:28,500
You ideas are original and your perspective is unexpected.

340
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,380
I'm flattered.

341
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,820
Actually, it's been a long time since I've talked to a young person other than Shi Yan.

342
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,519
That's why I asked you to come here today. Let's have a chat.

343
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,820
It's also a way for me to get fresh new ideas from young minds.

344
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,319
You're being modest. It's I who have a lot to learn from you.

345
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,739
It's all the same.

346
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:52,920
Have a cup of tea first. It's from my collection.

347
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,000
I rarely offer it to my guests.

348
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,860
I'm not much of a tea drinker. I usually drink soft drinks.

349
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,720
So maybe I won't be able to appreciate the exquisite taste of your tea.

350
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,520
Give it a try first.

351
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,680
Drink it and you'll like it.

352
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,580
It was boiled in melted snow.

353
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,260
What's with being boiled in melted snow?

354
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,480
Don't you like snow?

355
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,799
How do you know she likes snow?

356
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,079
She wrote it in her Wechat posts.

357
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,140
 Shi Yan is being sarcastic, isn't he? 

358
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,699
 He's blaming me for being gone too long and coming back too late. 

359
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,100
It's good. It tastes like snow. I like it.

360
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,959
I'll go out in the yard while you guys talk business.

361
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,459
Then let's get started, Mr. Guan.

362
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,959
Sure.

363
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,919
It's hard to believe, right? My first pot of gold was only 435 yuan.

364
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,300
And then it grew into my Guan Capital.

365
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,939
Impressive.

366
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:53,839
That's awesome.

367
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,530
Zheng Shuyi, be more restrained.

368
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,300
Uncle Guan, it's time to eat.

369
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,060
Ms. Zheng and I were having a great time. I forgot all about the meal.

370
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,239
Shi Yan, with your reminder, I'm really feeling a bit hungry.

371
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,160
Mr. Guan, I had a great time talking to you today.

372
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,540
I'll put together a draft for your perusal as soon as I can.

373
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,499
I'll leave you to your meal.

374
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:23,559
The food is on the table. Eat before you go.

375
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,720
Even he's not in a hurry, why should you be?

376
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,380
Let's eat.

377
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,980
Come on.

378
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,340
He's so kind.

379
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,359
Come and sit.

380
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,079
How old are you?

381
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,319
I'm 25, soon to be 26.

382
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,820
Shi Yan is 27 and two years older than you.

383
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,179
You two are quite compatible with each other, aren't you?

384
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,920
I think so.

385
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,020
Come on, let's eat.

386
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,239
Do you have any plans for later?

387
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,019
How about another round at the riding club?

388
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:14,620
It's been a long time since either of us have been there.

389
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,559
I've always wanted to go back.

390
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,259
The view there is breathtaking.

391
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:20,759
But I've been a little busy lately.

392
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,759
I must go there again sometime in the future.

393
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,900
You can just go there when you want.

394
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,018
- Is it right, Shi Yan? 
 - Yes.

395
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:28,799
Thank you, Uncle Guan.

396
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,419
Shi Yan has been going to the riding club less frequently in the past two years.

397
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,280
But he knows his way around.

398
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,100
You can go with him.

399
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,740
Let him help you should you need anything.

400
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,500
Did he go there very often?

401
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,039
He's been busy since he founded Cloud Innovation and hasn't frequented the club.

402
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:52,580
He used to go every week when he was a kid.

403
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,139
Mr. Shi loved riding horses since he was a kid.

404
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,039
So what was he like when he was a kid?

405
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,960
He was a considerate kid.

406
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,760
He always aimed for the highest standards.

407
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,839
But... kids are kids.

408
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,680
No matter how calm and collected he was,

409
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,759
he could get frustrated and upset.

410
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:22,780
He didn't talk to his father when he was unhappy.

411
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,020
Instead, he liked to go ride around.

412
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,300
He's just like he was when he was a kid.

413
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,140
He keeps everything to himself.

414
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,000
When Mingyu's crisis disrupted his business plan,

415
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,750
he took care of the situation

416
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,080
before leaving to start Cloud Innovation.

417
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,819
He personally handed Mingyu over to his brother-in-law.

418
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:51,860
For this personâ€¦

419
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,580
Many people didnâ€™t know the situation and thought that Shi Yan was evading responsibility.

420
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,690
But he's made more sacrifices and shouldered more responsibilities

421
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,400
than anyone else.

422
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,559
Actually, this is little known to many.

423
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,659
Shi Yan actually handed over his reputation to his brother-in-law

424
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:16,759
whom he felt was best suited to take the company over.

425
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,919
He's always had a dream, and he's been preparing for a long time.

426
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,820
That's why we started Cloud Innovation.

427
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,060
He's not talkative and dislikes to tell people what's on his mind.

428
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,340
You should talk to him more often and rid him of this bad habit.

429
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,740
I don't want him to keep everything to himself.

430
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,959
Uncle Guan,

431
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,519
shrimp doesn't taste good when its cold.

432
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,519
Look! He doesn't want me to talk about him.

433
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,780
Okay.

434
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,139
Let him tell you himself.

435
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,880
But now Cloud Innovation is thriving.

436
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,680
His dedication and hard work were not in vain.

437
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,500
He's been too focused on work the past two years to properly fall in love.

438
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:11,799
Cloud Innovation is now highly regarded in the industry.

439
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,019
Its choice reflects Mr. Shi's sense of social responsibility and vision.

440
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:20,559
I'm sure Mr. Shi will realize his dream.

441
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,760
Ms. Zheng, you're a great girl.

442
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,340
I've met many journalists.

443
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,359
Some friends of mine have been doing this for years.

444
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,599
Eventually, they all changed careers.

445
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,619
You're so young, with many opportunities, it must been hard for you to remain committed.

446
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:43,380
Actually, the journalists in our agency are mostly young girls.

447
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,279
And they're all nice charming ladies.

448
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:52,540
Being nice and charming is not a bad thing.

449
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,340
People will enjoy being interviewed

450
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,980
by a nice, intelligent, and charming reporter.

451
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,939
Yeah, they will.

452
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:08,019
Mr. Shi also likes nice charming reporters. Right?

453
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,739
Isn't it true?

454
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:15,780
Remember my coworker from the press conference?

455
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,200
You've stared at her for a long time.

456
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:22,100
Oh, really?

457
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,480
- No. 
 - It's real.

458
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,720
These ribs are still a little spicy.

459
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,247
Would you mind recooking it?

460
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:36,630
â™«  It's not just a coincidence  â™«

461
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:40,019
â™«  It's not just to hear the words "I'm sorry"  â™«

462
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:41,820
You asked her where she was.

463
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,680
I told you she was not feeling okay and went home.

464
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,819
Then you even asked what was wrong with her.

465
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,301
I was teasing you.

466
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,860
Really?

467
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,539
What? You don't believe me?

468
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,060
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

469
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,139
- I'm not that convinced. 
 - Then how can I convince you?

470
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:02,319
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

471
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,319
I'll have that.

472
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,839
I want shrimp.

473
00:32:09,868 --> 00:32:11,720
â™«  Always erratic  â™«

474
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,109
If you don't peel it for meâ€¦

475
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:16,258
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

476
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:18,258
I'll peel it myself.

477
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:22,891
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

478
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:25,121
â™«  I will also be cautious  â™«

479
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:27,344
â™«  I will also be breathless  â™«

480
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:32,210
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

481
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,035
Here you are.

482
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:40,652
â™«  I hear your heart whispering  â™«

483
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:42,848
â™«  The unresolved clouds  â™«

484
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:45,199
â™«  Are deserted and sweet  â™«

485
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:49,955
â™«  I can't grasp it, so I take a deep breath  â™«

486
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:54,425
â™«  Let flowing breaths fill my memory  â™«

487
00:32:54,425 --> 00:32:56,714
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

488
00:32:56,714 --> 00:33:01,133
â™«  No need to ask, I am willing  â™«

489
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,459
Get in.

490
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,720
It's a beautiful day.

491
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,739
It's so nice to be in the sun.

492
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:14,799
It's a great day for exercise.

493
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,799
What are you up to?

494
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,100
I don't want to get in the car. I want to go for a walk. Will you come with me?

495
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Zheng Shuyi, you are creating everything in heaven and earth now, and I canâ€™t satisfy you anymore.

496
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,600
I not only create heaven and earth, I also compose poetry.

497
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,000
You write poems?

498
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,500
"Shuyi didnâ€™t know that Jiangcheng was far away,

499
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,500
The Shi family's little Yan was jealous of snow."

500
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,300
Zheng Shuyi.

501
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,600
What is it? The poem was accurate in every way.

502
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,200
Fine. You're right.

503
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

504
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,700
I didn't expect my poem to have amused you.

505
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,400
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

506
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,500
I've got something else to please you with.

507
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,200
Mr. Shi, would you like to hear it?

508
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,000
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

509
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,400
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

510
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,800
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

511
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,000
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

512
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,600
I've been thinking about it a lot these days.

513
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,100
I carefully prepared a featured interview for Cloud Innovation.

514
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,200
I typed even every punctuation mark all by myself.

515
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,400
It shows how much I care about you and this interview.

516
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,000
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

517
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,800
It's getting late. Let's go home.

518
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

519
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

520
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,700
Ouch!

521
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,000
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

522
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,800
It's not a big deal.

523
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,500
It's just that my wrists are a little sore from typing out this plan word for word.

524
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,700
It's nothing serious. I can still stand it.

525
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
You can.

526
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,199
You can, what?

527
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,100
- Aren't you doing a featured interview? Yes, you can. 
 - Thank you!

528
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,800
But I have two requests.

529
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,400
I can agree to two or even 200!

530
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,800
First, you have to get to know the daily routine of Cloud Innovation and me.

531
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,200
You should understand the specifics of the project and, in particular, my ideas.

532
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,000
â™«  At night, the stars are crushed into pieces and become pure as they fall  â™«

533
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,200
Why does it sound a bit off.

534
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Will you say yes or no?

535
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
Yes, yes.

536
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,400
I can't miss the chance to get to know you better.

537
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,720
Second, I have the right to reject any draft

538
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,000
if it's biased or not in-depth enough.

539
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,600
That's a harsh requirement for this interview.

540
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,800
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

541
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,700
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

542
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,300
Get in the car.

543
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,400
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

544
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,200
I've agreed to the second request.

545
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm looking forward to working with Cloud Innovation!

546
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
I'll never give you a chance to call it off.

547
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,200
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

548
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,000
Old Fan, take Ms. Zheng home first. I have something else to do.

549
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Got it.

550
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

551
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

552
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,000
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

553
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,200
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

554
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,400
 Be patient. 

555
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
 She doesn't know me yet. 

556
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,600
 Wait until she knows you well enough and then make a decision. 

557
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,600
 See you, 

558
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,000
 Wu City. 

559
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,100
 Dear travelers. 

560
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,000
 Flight MU5857 to Jiangcheng is now boarding. 

561
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,800
What a coincidence. You're here to pick someone up?

562
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah, that someone is you.

563
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Any problem?

564
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
You're picking me up?

565
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,300
It's been a long time and I missed you.

566
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,300
I guessed as much.

567
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,800
This is the overview of Zhanlan's development in the past few years.

568
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,600
Three car companies and two investment and financing companies

569
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,500
have expressed a clear willingness to cooperate with Zhanlan.

570
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,900
If we want to partner with them there's a lot of competition.

571
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,200
Mr. Shi, you need to work harder.

572
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,700
Yu You, what do you think?

573
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,200
Solid-state batteries have high performance plus high safety.

574
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,600
It is indeed promising.

575
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,800
And there may be a huge market for it.

576
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,700
This is also in line with our country's carbon-clean goals.

577
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,700
Zhanlan is indeed a leading player in this industry.

578
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,100
Your analysis is right on the money.

579
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,700
Zhanlan has a well-developed and robust production system.

580
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,300
The risk is low if we invest in them.

581
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,800
But there's so much competition.

582
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,000
It's not like the first two rounds of investment.

583
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,400
And that means,

584
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,100
Cloud Innovation may have to pay a big price to be a part of the project.

585
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,300
But according to the assessment, there's a good market for it.

586
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,800
Mr. Shi.

587
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,400
Mr. Shi, what do you think?

588
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,800
Did you notice the accident with the new energy car the other day?

589
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,800
It seems to be an accident with Hengxin's new energy car.

590
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,200
They use Zhanlan's batteries.

591
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Zhanlanâ€¦

592
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,200
Car accidents are inevitable.

593
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,500
Besides, it's not necessarily the battery's problem.

594
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,400
Investment is always risky.

595
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,100
I just want to collect more information.

596
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,400
As you said, investing in Zhanlan is a very competitive business.

597
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Choosing Zhanlan is definitely a no-brainier for Cloud Innovation.

598
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,300
Mr. Shi, I thought you were optimistic about Zhanlan.

599
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm optimistic about how new energy can improve life quality and the environment,

600
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,200
and the importance of entering this industry.

601
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,700
But entering the solid-state batteries industry requires a great investment.

602
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,000
More research and analysis are necessary.

603
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,300
But I heard they'll finalize the money-raising plan in two months.

604
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,200
Will it be too late to make a decision by then?

605
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,400
 Yeah, that's right. 

606
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,200
With so many investment firms putting their money in, it can't be wrong.

607
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
Maybe we can make an arraignment with them.

608
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,900
We agree to take a smaller share.

609
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,400
Mr. Shi, I know you're cautious.

610
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,000
But Zhanlan is an opportunity that can't be missed.

611
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,500
- Tan Yong. 
 - Yes, sir.

612
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,200
Do another round of evaluation and then we'll see.

613
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
Got it.

614
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,479
Shi Yan, that's a good one.

615
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,800
It's really difficult to take Zhanlan now.

616
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,200
Everyone will be impressed if you nail it.

617
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,600
But if you fail, they will also understand.

618
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,600
That's a clever move.

619
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,700
This is the assessment report. Take a look.

620
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,800
These are the accident figures of cars using this battery.

621
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,000
And some related accident investigation reports.

622
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,300
This year alone, there are so many accidents.

623
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,200
But that doesn't mean anything.

624
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
There are many energy vehicles on the road.

625
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,100
So the accident number will go up.

626
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,400
Oil vehicles also have accident rates.

627
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,300
Their figures aren't necessarily lower than new energy vehicles'.

628
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
You're right.

629
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,300
But the key is that although Zhanlan has a large market share,

630
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,200
their battery technology is from last year.

631
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,500
It hasn't been upgraded in one year.

632
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,700
They're taking a skyrocketing number of orders. They must be looking to expand production,

633
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,200
if they're successful in raising capital.

634
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,900
They must want to expand their scale and continue to increase their market share.

635
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,800
But in the long run, technological breakthroughs are the key.

636
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,600
If the battery problem remains unresolved,

637
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,300
accidents will keep happening.

638
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,200
Major car companies will also think of alternatives.

639
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,600
Then, it'll be hard to tell whether our investment will remain safe.

640
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,800
Zhanlanâ€™s financing this time has gone through Series B, Angel Round and Series A

641
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,600
Zhanlanâ€™s financing this time has gone through Series B, Angel Round, and Series A.

642
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,000
Actually, to some extent,

643
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,600
Zhanlan doesn't fit Cloud Innovation's investment strategy anymore.

644
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,200
There can be exceptions, but like you said another round of research is necessary.

645
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,800
These old men are in a hurry to get Zhanlan.

646
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,000
But if something goes wrong, it will be our fault in judgment.

647
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So we can't do what they say.

648
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,900
Shi Yan, let's just do what you said.

649
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Letâ€™s wait for the new round of evaluation results.

650
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,000
Looks like... I'll have to go there in person.

â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

661
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,500
â™«  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  â™«

662

â™«  Does it hurt  â™«

â™«  Do you want to let go like this?  â™«

667
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,300
â™«  Does it hurt  â™«

668
