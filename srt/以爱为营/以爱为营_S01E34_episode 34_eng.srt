 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,600
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,700
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,300
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,900
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,400
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,700
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,000
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,100
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,700
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,500
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,600
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,000
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,600
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,100
   

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,700
   

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, we had a history.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,700
But everybody is talking about you. Why did you say I started it?

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,500
All right.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
"Guess what I heard today.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,600
You must know the intern Qin Shiyue. Zheng Shuyi is dating her uncle."

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,400
Come and get it. You'd better smash it after you get it.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I wonder if you're stupid.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,800
It's the 21st century. You think you can destroy the evidence by smashing the phone?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,200
The rumor has been going around for so long. You should explain it to me.

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Don't leave.

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Let go.

33
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,800
Hello, please tell me Mrs. Qiu's phone number.

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Okay, thanks.

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,300
Hello, is that Mrs. Qiu?

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,400
 Who is this? 

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,600
I am Xu Yuling, a journalist from Financial Introduce.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
 What can I do for you? 

39
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,100
I am calling you to talk to you about something.

40
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,700
 What's the matter? 

41
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,000
Zheng Shuyi from our company is having an affair with your husband.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,200
People in our company are talking about it.

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
- I thinkâ€¦ 
  - Ms. Xu, thank you. 

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,000
 I think you made a mistake. 

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Ms. Zheng is dating Mr. Shi. 

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,200
 She has nothing to do with my husband. 

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Qiuâ€¦

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,500
Shi Yan.

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
That's impossible.

50
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Why is she still dating him?

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Come in.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
What did the doctor say?

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,100
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

54
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,900
Let's get down to business.

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,200
Sister Yi, you know, Xu Yuling stole my outline and my interview.

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
I listened to you and didn't quarrel with her.

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,400
She spread rumors about my private life. I can't take it anymore.

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,400
My hand got injured. I want her to give me an explanation.

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,900
What happened? There must be a misunderstanding.

60
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,300
There is no misunderstanding.

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Like I said, my boyfriend and I are in a relationship.

62
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,200
She maliciously speculated and caused trouble by spreading rumors.

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,000
You've heard the rumors. I don't want to repeat it.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,700
What's going on with your boyfriend and you?

65
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,100
What happened between me and my boyfriend is not important.

66
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,800
As I said, we are in a normal man and woman relationship.

67
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,900
He is not an old man.

68
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,700
He is an unmarried young male. What's wrong with it?

69
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,650
Shuyi,

70
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,000
you hurt your hand. Go back home and take a rest.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
I'll talk to the lead editor about this.

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,700
Don't worry.

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,000
I will give you an explanation.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,100
Get some rest. You don't have to come to work for a while.

75
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,200
You won't be charged any leave.

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Then I will go home.

77
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,900
What's wrong?

78
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
Hug me.

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,200
What's wrong with your hand?

80
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
Nothing.

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,900
My colleague didn't see me when she closed the door. My hand got slammed in the door.

82
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,800
Why are you so careless?

83
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,200
Does it hurt?

84
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,700
It hurts.

85
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,800
I feel like I'm going to be crippled.

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
You will not.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
I mean it.

88
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,300
I can't move my right hand. I can only use my left hand.

89
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,800
It is crippled.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
What did the doctor say?

91
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,700
The doctor said I can't use my hand to feed myself,

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,100
and I can't use my hand to drink.

93
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Are you listening to me?

94
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,600
The doctor said I can't use my hand to drink.

95
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,400
I can't carry the bag myself.

96
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
I can't comb my hair by myself.

97
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,400
I need to be carried upstairs. I need to be carried in your arms.

98
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
It's so nice of you.

99
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,300
Move in with me.

100
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,200
I'll do everything I promised you.

101
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
 Why did he ask me to move in with him? 

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
 That's not good. 

103
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,500
 Did we skip a lot of steps? 

104
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,000
 Are presidents now so efficient? 

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,400
 Does my request have anything to do with moving in with him? 

106
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,700
 He sounded like when I moved in with him, he would go home for three meals. 

107
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,200
 Yeah, I see. No more digging. 

108
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,100
Where are you going?

109
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Go home and pack up.

110
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
What's wrong?

111
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,400
Nothing. I want to kiss you.

112
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Just a kiss.

113
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,900
Do you have wine here?

114
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,700
Bring me some wine. Alcohol will do.

115
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,900
This is my office. Stop it.

116
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,300
If you don't mind,

117
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,900
let's do it.

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,500
You should get back to work first.

119
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,700
The door is broken.

120
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,100
It's not.

121
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,500
You pressed the wrong button.

122
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,700
Hello. Go back to the Shi Mansion and stay there for a few days.

123
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,200
 Why? I don't want to go back. 

124
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,400
Your auntie wants to live with me.

125
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,900
 Huh? 

126
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,400
I tried. But it didn't work. We have too little time.

127
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,300
Chen Kang, have you considered the advice given by Professor Li?

128
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,500
Mr. Shi, I know you're doing this for Le'an's good.

129
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,900
But Le'an is my heart's blood. There's no way I'm giving it away.

130
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
All right.

131
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,300
We will think of something else.

132
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,100
- But you have to have faith. 
 - Okay.

133
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,800
- See you. 
 - Take care, Mr. Shi.

134
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,400
 Have you finished your packing? 

135
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,700
 My hand hurts. I can't pack. 

136
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,300
 Wait for me. 

137
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,977
   

138
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,500
You've gone too far this time.

139
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,800
There is a vacancy in the education section. The lead editor and I have talked it over.

140
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,100
You are experienced. You will take charge of the department alone.

141
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,500
Hand over the work at hand. Check in next week.

142
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Thank you and the lead editor.

143
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
About the job,

144
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,900
I won't take it.

145
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
When I became famous, Zheng Shuyi was a nobody.

146
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,000
I have shots at better jobs.

147
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,200
I work for Financial Introduce because I believe that no one can do it better than me.

148
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,000
Where I go and what I do, it's all my decision.

149
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,650
Chief Editor,

150
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,300
thank you.

151
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,300
Thank you for taking care of me.

152
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
This one?

153
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,300
What else do you want to bring?

154
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,500
That coat.

155
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Anything else?

156
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Those.

157
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,700
Anything else?

158
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,300
No.

159
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
Bring the groceries.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Forget it. I'll call a moving company.

161
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
No.

162
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,400
I'm just staying at your place for a few days. I will come back.

163
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,600
I'll pick it up if I need anything.

164
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,000
Mr. Shi, you don't want me to come back, do you?

165
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,600
If you want to go home after living in my house for a while,

166
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
the developer of my house has failed.

167
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,200
And it's a loss for me.

168
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,300
As a qualified businessman, I do not trade at a loss.

169
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
What's wrong?

170
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,400
You used to have a lot of guts.

171
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,000
You dared to enter a stranger's house at night.

172
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
What are you afraid of?

173
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,200
I am not afraid. My feet hurt.

174
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,700
Really?

175
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,100
I will carry you.

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,300
They do not hurt that much.

177
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,900
Dinner's ready.

178
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,900
Here.

179
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
What's wrong?

180
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,000
They are not scallions. They are allium chinenses.

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,500
I didn't ask you.

182
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Are you sure these are not scallions? They look like scallions.

183
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,000
They look the same.

184
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,400
One is in the Lycoris family. One is a bulbous solitary plant.

185
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,700
I see.

186
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,700
I am not talking about that.

187
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,100
Have you forgotten what you promised me today?

188
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,200
Did you do that to lure me into your house?

189
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
Yes.

190
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,900
Open your mouth.

191
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
 Is this real? 

192
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Hello.

193
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
 Mr. Shi, Jianxing replied to me. 

194
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
 Do you want me to arrange a trip for you? 

195
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Ask Guan Ji to do it. I amâ€¦

196
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,300
busy.

197
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,800
 Okay. 

198
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,900
Help me do my hair. Okay?

199
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,500
Easy. It hurts.

200
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,200
Okay.

201
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,200
I'll let you work. I am going to take a shower and go to bed.

202
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,700
 Why can't he understand me? 

203
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,700
I mean, where do I sleep?

204
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,500
Where do you think?

205
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,200
I will take a shower first.

206
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,800
Shuyi.

207
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,900
What?

208
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,300
Did the doctor say you couldn't shower yourself?

209
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,100
He didn't say that.

210
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,800
Really?

211
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,500
You couldn't eat yourself.

212
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,200
You couldn't drink yourself.

213
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,900
You can't do your hair.

214
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,700
How do you take a shower?

215
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,800
I will keep my hand out of water.

216
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,500
I took a shower before I left this morning.

217
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,400
I will take a quick shower.

218
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
How?

219
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,400
Don't you have to take off your clothes?

220
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,100
Don't you use shower gel?

221
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,400
I already told you, there's no need.

222
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,900
You are untidy.

223
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
Yes, I am untidy.

224
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,300
Shuyi, are you sure you don't need my help?

225
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,100
If you need me later, I may run out of patience.

226
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,800
Don't change your mind.

227
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I said I didn't need your help.

228
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,000
If I change my mind, I will call you "Dad".

229
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,400
Dad.

230
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,600
Help me hook my bra.

231
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,300
What did you say?

232
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,700
 What's the big deal? I just want him to hook my bra. 

233
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,100
 It's not like I'm asking him to do a backhanded dunk. 

234
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Help me hook my bra.

235
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,300
Come on. I am sleepy.

236
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,900
Done.

237
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,300
What?

238
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,150
Anything else I can do for you?

239
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,300
No.

240
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,400
Are you nervous? Or does your hand hurt?

241
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,700
 I am nervous. And my hand hurts. 

242
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,900
My hand hurts.

243
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,400
The nerves of the fingertips are linked with the heart. It hurts terribly.

244
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,800
Have you taken painkillers?

245
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,100
Yes, but it still hurts.

246
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,600
Get some sleep. It doesn't hurt when you fall asleep.

247
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,300
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

248

â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

279
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,300
Shi Yan.

280
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,300
Shi Yan.

281
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,300
 You are awake. 

282
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,100
When did you leave?

283
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,400
 8:00. 

284
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,800
So early.

285
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,300
I just remembered.

286
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,900
Did you get up in the middle of the night and take a shower?

287
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,800
 I thought it was a dream. 

288
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,900
 All right, I will let you work. 

289
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,400
He was aboveboard while I was in his bed.

290
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,800
He didn't do anything. He even didn't kiss me.

291
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
Shi Yan is weird.

292
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,700
He asked you to travel for him. Isn't he a workaholic?

293
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,600
His assistant said Ms. Zheng injured her hand.

294
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,100
I think he wants to take care of her.

295
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,000
Shuyi injured her hand?

296
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
Didn't you know?

297
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,000
 You injured your hand? 

298
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,400
It's not a big deal. I'll be healed soon.

299
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,000
 Change dressings on time. Don't touch water. Avoid certain foods. 

300
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,200
 You will be all right soon. 

301
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,100
 You sound droopy. 

302
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,360
 Didn't Shi Yan take care of you? 

303
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,200
I am living in Shi Yan's house.

304
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,400
 Good for you. You moved fast. 

305
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,300
We shared a bed last night.

306
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,600
Enough. I don't want to hear it.

307
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,800
 I'll report you if you keep talking. 

308
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,500
But nothing happened.

309
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,100
Is that funny?

310
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,000
 No. I feel sorry for you. 

311
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,400
It's okay. You are just away for three days.

312
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,100
You're just going to Nanjiang on business. You will be back.

313
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,700
Three days?

314
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,900
Are you upset with me?

315
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Will it not affect you if I leave you for three days?

316
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,200
Do you not believe me or do you not have faith in yourself?

317
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,300
Guan Ji,

318
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,000
we can't be together every minute.

319
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,300
If we want a great relationship, we should trust each other

320
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,000
and be loyal to each other.

321
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,600
I can't do it. You can trust me.

322
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,300
I trust you. And you can trust me.

323
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,600
But I don't want to be away from you.

324
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,100
Then come back early.

325
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,600
- Shanshan. 
 - Dazhuang.

326
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,800
My god, Shanshan.

327
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,200
I am here to see my boyfriend off.

328
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,000
Good for you, Shanshan.

329
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,800
You didn't tell us about him. Isn't he your official boyfriend?

330
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,000
Shanshan is a peach. Be sweet to her.

331
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,800
If you bully her, I won't leave you alone.

332
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,600
Are you here to pick someone up?

333
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,600
I am here to pick up my fiancee.

334
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,700
- We are going to get a marriage license. 
 - Really?

335
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
Congratulations. I'll give you a red envelope.

336
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,500
Thank you.

337
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,200
When will you get married?

338
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,900
No rush.

339
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Shut up.

340
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,800
We will get married soon.

341
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Am I unattractive?

342
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Darn it, Xu Yuling.

343
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,200
I can't use a computer. I can't type.

344
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,900
I am sitting by myself. I am so miserable.

345
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,300
 I will ask Qin Shiyue to help you. 

346
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,300
Shi Yan,

347
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,700
you are telling me to my face that I am unattractive.

348
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Auntie.

349
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
Come here.

350
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,200
Is your hand all right?

351
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,300
It's fine. It will be all right soon.

352
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,700
Uncle, here you are.

353
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,000
The task you gave me has been successfully completed.

354
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
You may leave.

355
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
It doesn't hurt. Right?

356
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,900
I worked for your wife for a day. Won't you invite me to dinner?

357
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,400
Are you hungry?

358
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,800
I will make you something delicious.

359
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,500
What do you want to eat?

360
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,800
 You are unattractive. 

361
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,300
Come over here.

362
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,200
What are you thinking about?

363
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
I am thinkingâ€¦

364
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,200
Can I sit on your lap?

365
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,500
No.

366
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
Why?

367
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Because you can't have dinner that way.

368
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,300
 Do you only pay lip service? 

369
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,800
But I want to.

370
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,600
As you like.

371
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,400
Why are you looking at me?

372
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,100
It's nothing.

373
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,100
I am going to bed.

374
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,100
Shuyi.

375
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,100
Remember to take painkillers before going to bed.

376
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,400
 That's it? 

377
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,790
   

378
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,600
 I heard something today. 

379
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,400
 What happened? 

380
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,100
You are back.

381
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,600
Have you been drinking?

382
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
I drank a little.

383
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,000
 No more chatting. I am going to bed. 

384
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,900
 So early? 

385
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,300
 It's 11:00. 

386
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,000
 You didn't go to sleep until midnight before. 

387
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,000
 Are you and Shi Yan going toâ€¦ 

388
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,000
 No. 

389
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,500
 Really? 

390
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,000
 It's not about me. 

391
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,600
 Do you think I'm the problem? 

392
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,200
Are you going to take a shower?

393
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,700
Not now.

394
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:41,200
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

395
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,400
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

396
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,400
I'm afraid I'll hurt your fingers.

397
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,200
- Iâ€¦ 
 - I don't want your explanation.

398
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:01,300
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

399
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,600
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

400
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,700
I want to meet Ms. Zheng.

401
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,800
Shuyi is on sick leave.

402
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,500
Sick leave?

403
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,600
Thank you.

404
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,960
What?

405
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,500
   

406
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,200
The phone won't stop.

407
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,700
- Hello. 
  - Hello, Shuyi. 

408
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,100
I am at Financial Introduce. Your colleague says you're hurt. Are you all right?

409
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,100
I am all right. What do you want?

410
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,100
 Nothing. I want to invite you to dinner and talk to you. 

411
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,500
I will pass on the dinner. What do you want to say?

412
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,800
Shuyi.

413
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,400
What's up, Mr. Shi? Are you angry?

414
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,600
I am yours. Why are you still so stingy?

415
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,700
He bothered us in the morning. Can't I be stingy?

416
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Shi Yan, don't scare me.
