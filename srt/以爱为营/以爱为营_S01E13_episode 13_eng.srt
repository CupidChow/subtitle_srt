 "Lemon Soda"- Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,625
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,675
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,300
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,788
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:48,225
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,699
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,450
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,485
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,200
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,250
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,111
   

22
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:42,850
   

23
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,788
Shuyi, you are back.

24
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,829
I heard you did an interview as soon as you got back.

25
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,148
You are unlucky in love, but lucky at work.

26
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:05,429
Yuling, please come to my office.

27
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,188
Okay, Chief Editor.

28
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:16,509
You went to the interview after you got off the plane?

29
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,808
You went to the interview after you got off the plane?

30
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,828
I interviewed Guan Xiangcheng.

31
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:23,769
Who?

32
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,348
Guan who?

33
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:30,608
That's right. It's the Guan Xiangcheng that you are thinking about.

34
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:33,048
Guan Xiangcheng.

35
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:36,469
Chief Editor, what do you mean?

36
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,969
I can't write this month's front page?

37
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,249
Why?

38
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:43,369
Yuling, the lead editor and I know you've been working hard.

39
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:45,769
We wanted to let you write the front page.

40
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,149
- Butâ€¦ 
 - Chief Editor, do you know how much I paid for this interview?

41
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:54,089
I reached out to a lot of people. I pestered three vice presidents for weeks.

42
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,768
They finally agreed to do a joint interview.

43
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,449
How could you go back on your word?

44
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:02,609
Did you know that Zheng Shuyi submitted the first draft of the interview with Guan Xiangcheng this morning?

45
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,149
What would you do if you were the lead editor?

46
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:06,929
Do you know Guan Xiangcheng?

47
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:10,349
If the interview with him is not put on the front page

48
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,068
the industry will think we're crazy.

49
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,649
Chief Editor, Guan Xiangcheng took a back seat. He hasn't spoken to the press in years.

50
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,889
Chief Editor, Guan Xiangcheng took a back seat. He hasn't spoken to the press in years.

51
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,949
Chief Editor, Guan Xiangcheng took a back seat. He hasn't spoken to the press in years.

52
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,509
I seriously question the authenticity of this interview.

53
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,729
I've checked it. It was a face-to-face interview.

54
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,809
Zheng Shuyi, good for you.

55
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,989
What did she do to Guan Xiangcheng?

56
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,769
Did she give up her dignity for a front page?

57
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,369
Cut it out!

58
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:47,548
Don't talk nonsense

59
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:51,928
I know Guan Xiangcheng.

60
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:53,689
He's not what you think he is.

61
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,749
Zheng Shuyi has been your colleague for years.

62
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:58,629
She wouldn't do that.

63
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,508
You may go back to work.

64
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,268
All right, Chief Editor.

65
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,889
- Zheng Shuyi, did you do that on purpose? 
 - What?

66
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,868
What did it cost you to interview Guan Xiangcheng?

67
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,808
I've always wanted to interview Guan Xiangcheng. But it didn't cost me anything.

68
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,569
It was he who contacted me.

69
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:33,928
I think I was lucky.

70
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,589
Lucky?

71
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:38,109
Guan Xiangcheng hasn't spoken to the press in years.

72
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:40,729
You told me you were lucky?

73
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,928
That's right. What do you think?

74
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,908
Everyone knows you are beautiful.

75
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:49,749
I think you're taking advantage of it.

76
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:53,769
I see why you've been dressed nicely, but I can't see you in the office.

77
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,789
Xu Yuling, we are colleagues.

78
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,009
Don't say awful things.

79
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,009
You dare to do it, but you dare not admit it?

80
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:13,569
If I took advantage of my beauty,

81
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,949
would you still be here and say that to me?

82
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:28,228
Have you finished all your work?

83
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,521
Is there a tea party here?

84
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:36,189
Zheng Shuyi, please come to my office.

85
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:44,569
Even though you're pretty, you were still dumped.

86
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,128
Have you thought it through?

87
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:49,909
Are you sure you want to post the feature of Cloud Innovation on the e-newsletter?

88
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,489
I am sure. I've told Shi Yan about it.

89
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,269
- He agreed to it. 
 - He agreed to it?

90
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,509
Yes. Shi Yan authorized it.

91
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,889
He agreed to post the feature on the e-newsletter only.

92
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,329
All right.

93
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,469
I've talked to the lead editor.

94
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:06,989
We will make a feature first.

95
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:11,429
- If it gets a good reaction, we will continue. 
 - If not, we'll postpone it.

96
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:12,868
Got it.

97
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:15,989
Shuyi, you have to write the manuscript of the main journal.

98
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,949
Are you sure you can arrange your schedule?

99
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,169
I am sure.

100
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,269
I will finish Guan Xiangcheng's interview in a couple of days.

101
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:26,968
You ate all the food.

102
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:29,489
I am young.

103
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,169
I need more food than others.

104
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:42,968
 Thank you. 

105
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:49,308
 Can he understand what I mean? 

106
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,009
Ask me if you don't understand.

107
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,228
If he asks me, I will tell him about it again.

108
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,288
I will thank him again.

109
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:34,328
 Busy. 

110
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:42,208
 When will you be free? I will invite you to dinner to thank you. 

111
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,969
Mom, eat more.

112
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,589
My grandpa specially cooked these himself.

113
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,389
These are all my favorites.

114
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,789
Dad, thank you.

115
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,628
Eat more.

116
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:58,109
Here. Dad, eat more.

117
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:02,929
Yue, how is your work? Are you feeling more comfortable with it?

118
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,909
It's okay. But I am a little tired.

119
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,129
I have a lot of work every day.

120
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,789
How do you get along with your colleagues?

121
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:13,629
Well, something happened today.

122
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,508
My leader Zheng Shuyi.

123
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:16,769
Mom, you know her.

124
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:19,509
She invited me to go to your concert.

125
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,549
I remember her.

126
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:25,129
She interviewed Uncle Guan yesterday.

127
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,808
The chief editor was so happy that she gave the front page to her.

128
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,328
I don't know how she got in touch with Uncle Guan.

129
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,388
She said she was lucky.

130
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:40,949
 "Shuyi didnâ€™t know that Jiangcheng was far away, 

131
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:44,208
 The Shi family's little Yan was jealous of snow." 

132
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:53,188
I'll get some water. Enjoy the food, Sister.

133
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,009
Xu Yuling was jealous.

134
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,569
She quarreled with her.

135
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,968
She said Ms. Shuyi got her chance with her beauty.

136
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:10,309
Is that ridiculous?

137
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:12,788
She shouldn't say that.

138
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:16,129
But luck is a part of strength.

139
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,489
That's not the point. Do you know what Ms. Shuyi said?

140
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,397
That's not the point. Do you know what Ms. Shuyi said?

141
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:20,649
What did she say?

142
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:21,669
She said, "If I took advantage of my beauty,

143
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,208
She said, "If I took advantage of my beauty,

144
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,668
would you still be here and say that to me?"

145
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,389
That's funny.

146
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:33,809
She doesnâ€™t even look at how many people chase after Sister Shuyi every day. Did she have to do that?

147
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,569
I haven't been on the job very long.

148
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:39,889
But I see guys coming to Ms. Shuyi to please her.

149
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,169
Really?

150
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:46,248
This afternoon, Ms. Shuyi and I went to the dessert shop downstairs to buy afternoon tea.

151
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:50,469
A tall and handsome guy wanted to buy coffee for Ms. Shuyi.

152
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:52,169
Qin Shiyue.

153
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:54,829
Are you finished?

154
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:57,448
Yes.

155
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:06,288
Mom, what did I do?

156
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:14,628
 When will you be free? I will invite you to dinner to thank you. 

157
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,828
 This weekend. 

158
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,908
 What would you like to eat? 

159
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:29,608
 It doesn't matter. 

160
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,548
 What matters? 

161
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,448
Surprise.

162
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:51,348
Mom, what are you doing here?

163
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:58,749
Yi, move over.

164
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:01,109
Why are you sitting so far away from him?

165
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,708
Here, Madam.

166
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:09,249
Yu You, look.

167
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:13,328
To meet you, Yi got all dressed up.

168
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:16,168
 Am I dressed to see Yu You? 

169
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,089
You've always been smart and obedient.

170
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,929
Look at you.

171
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:28,029
You became a university professor.

172
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:30,269
And you have become more handsome.

173
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,009
Isn't there a lot of girls chasing you?

174
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:35,308
Madam, I am flattered.

175
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:41,629
- Have some tea. 
  - I should be able to make it after dinner. 

176
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:46,128
The temperature of the tea is just right.

177
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,208
This is very thoughtful of you.

178
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,398
There are few boys as thoughtful as you.

179
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:54,529
Am I right, Yi?

180
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:58,369
 Shi Yan is also thoughtful. 

181
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,749
Yu You is good at his job.

182
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:06,168
I learned it on the Internet.

183
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:08,589
- Am I right, Yi? 
 -  Yes.

184
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,628
Professor Yu is young and promising.

185
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,788
 There's a movie coming out. 

186
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,688
 The reviews are very good. 

187
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,792
 Do you want to watch it with me tonight? 

188
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,229
Say yes.

189
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:29,729
Thanks.

190
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:33,909
These are all Yi and my favorites.

191
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,148
Madam, please eat first.

192
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,748
We are eating.

193
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:50,768
It's a work thing. Right?

194
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,869
It's the weekend, but you are so busy.

195
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:56,028
You must be so tired.

196
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:58,609
Sorry, Madam. It's a friend.

197
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:01,148
It's fine. Just get it done.

198
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,488
 I am sorry. I am not free tonight. 

199
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,329
 I'm with my elders. 

200
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:11,768
 Mrs. Wang, good for you. 

201
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:14,009
 You don't know what I've given up for this. 

202
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,488
 I gave up the chance to eat alone with Shi Yan. 

203
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,369
No.

204
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:25,009
It's such a lame excuse.

205
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:27,549
He's offhand with me.

206
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:30,088
Does he think I'll believe him?

207
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:35,288
 All right, we'll hang out when you have time. 

208
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:39,788
I already bought the tickets.

209
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:41,628
Shuyi.

210
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:47,308
 Ms. Shuyi, do you want to watch a movie with me tonight? 

211
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:51,368
 I bought the tickets but I got stood up. 

212
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,228
 I didn't do anything. 

213
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:02,369
 Why do I feel like I'm being caught cheating? 

214
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,609
 God. 

215
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,129
 Wait. 

216
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,369
 Why should I feel sorry for Shi Yan? 

217
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,168
It's impolite to use your phone while eating.

218
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,929
It's my colleague.

219
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:18,209
Girls have to follow rules in everything they do.

220
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,428
This is what makes people likeable.

221
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,989
 Sorry, Yue. I can't make it today. 

222
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:31,009
 My mom came. I am with her. 

223
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:33,528
 I'll take a rain check. Okay? 

224
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:41,629
Jiangcheng is big, am I the only one who's free tonight?

225
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,149
Mom, are you full?

226
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,048
Can we go home?

227
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:51,009
I am stuffed.

228
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:56,148
You two come out for a walk with me, this old lady.  It will help aid in digestion.

229
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,949
Yu You, are you free?

230
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:05,548
Yes, Madam.

231
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,820
 I am sorry, Mr. Shi. 

232
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:34,728
 My mom came. I have to accompany her. I can only treat you to dinner next time. 

233
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,300
   

234
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:59,309
Mom, do you want to watch a movie?

235
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,749
I don't.

236
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:05,348
But you can watch it.

237
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:09,249
I've bought you the tickets. Take them.

238
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:12,249
Don't worry. I've checked online. Don't worry.

239
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:14,409
The reviews for this movie are very good.

240
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:17,428
This movie is for young people to watch.

241
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:19,289
You've been with me all night.

242
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,909
You need some time alone. Right?

243
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,468
Mom, it's late.

244
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:26,088
It's too late to watch a movie.

245
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:29,128
You always say young people can't stay up late.

246
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,589
It's late. I need to go home.

247
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,488
It's too early for you to go to bed.

248
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:38,429
Well, get in there. Just get in there.

249
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:42,209
Madam, I will get some drinks.

250
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,196
When did you buy the tickets?

251
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:54,376
You arranged it well. Why don't you two watch the movie?

252
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,528
Don't be rude.

253
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:59,648
It's a romantic movie. It's for young people.

254
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:01,408
Just get in there.

255
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,109
If you go in late, you will affect others.

256
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,688
Just go.

257
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,230
Yi, tell me about the post-production credits

258
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,910
when you get home.

259
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,824
 A gift from my mother. 

260
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:50,049
 Are you watching a movie with your mom? 

261
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:58,269
 Yes. 

262
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,989
 Is the movie good? 

263
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,588
 It would be better if I was with you. 

264
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:08,175
 Oh. 

265
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:10,608
 What does that mean? 

266
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,269
 Your mom is trendy. 

267
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:14,489
 She likes that kind of movie. 

268
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,642
 Yeah. 

269
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:28,829
 This movie is exciting. 

270
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,289
 The heroine wears the same red dress when she first met the hero. 

271
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,349
 She sneaked into the hero's house 

272
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:35,828
 and took the ashes of the hero. 

273
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:39,108
 The hero's family noticed that. They chased her. 

274
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,269
 It's now the chase scene. 

275
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:47,235
   

276
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,368
 What a lame ending. 

277
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,729
 You are right. So lame. 

278
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,729
 It finally ended. 

279
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:12,249
 Let's go. 

280
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,668
 I am so tired. 

281
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:19,188
 Qin Shiyue, what a coincidence. 

282
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,389
 If she sees us, I don't know what to say. 

283
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,629
Yu You, I saw an acquaintance.

284
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,129
I will leave.

285
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:29,429
If my mom asks you, tell her you are busy. Thank you.

286
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,608
Okay.

287
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,600
   

288
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:39,809
- Professor Yu. 
 - Good evening.

289
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,589
You told me you were with your elders.

290
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,900
It turned out you came to see the movie.

291
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:50,388
What are you looking for?

292
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:53,868
I am looking for your companion.

293
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,509
I don't have a companion.

294
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:57,808
You were alone?

295
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:01,428
Why didn't you watch it with me?

296
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:03,649
It must have been boring being alone.

297
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,009
But we watched the same movie.

298
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:10,829
We kind of watched it together. Right?

299
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:15,589
- Did you drive? 
 - Yes.

300
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,488
I didn't drive my car.

301
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:20,219
It's so late.

302
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,549
It's not safe for me to go home alone.

303
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,069
Could you drive me home?

304
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:39,829
What kind of movie do you like?

305
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:46,568
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

306
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:50,729
What a coincidence. I love it.

307
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,994
   

308
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,328
The hero is a psychopath.

309
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:11,368
He was sent to an asylum because of his mental illness.

310
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:15,489
His girlfriend was sent to an asylum because she missed him so much.

311
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:20,829
He longs for freedom.

312
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,689
He tried every means to escape.

313
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,169
With everyone's help,

314
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:31,229
he escaped from the asylum with them and regained his freedom.

315
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:34,570
What's wrong?

316
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,100
Nothing.

317
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:55,189
Do you have a girlfriend?

318
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:03,029
How do you know it's my girlfriend's?

319
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:08,448
 Don't you think that's weird? 

320
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:09,628
 Yes, it's weird. 

321
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,268
 So weird. 

322
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,209
Ms. Bi, Mr. Guan is here.

323
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,088
There he is.

324
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,188
Do you want to join him?

325
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:32,228
Guan Ji, what a coincidence.

326
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:34,729
Would like to join us and have a drink?

327
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:36,608
No, thanks.

328
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,189
It's not like you.

329
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,649
Come on.

330
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,696
I said no.

331
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:44,209
My girlfriend is there.

332
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:47,309
She will get angry if I stay with you.

333
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:48,689
You are mean.

334
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:50,028
No kidding.

335
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:52,589
When did you get a girlfriend?

336
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,829
Don't you see her angry?

337
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:57,869
Tell me about it.

338
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:00,449
She is very strict with me.

339
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,729
Why did you leave like that?

340
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:18,848
Isn't that how we get along?

341
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:23,369
It's late.

342
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,128
I will send you home.

343
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:45,848
 Yi, is the movie over? 

344
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:47,289
 Did he send you home? 

345
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:48,969
It's over.

346
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,628
He lives far away. I didn't let him.

347
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:00,249
I'll be home soon. I will hang up.

348
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:02,328
I'll be home soon. I will hang up.

349
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:17,868
Shi Yan, what are you doing here?

350
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:39,048
Who is that guy?

351
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:43,788
No one. He is just a friend.

352
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,288
What kind of friend?

353
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,409
Look! The moon is so roundâ€¦

354
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:54,109
so bright. Look.

355
00:24:54,109 --> 00:25:00,025
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

356
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:06,300
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

357
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:12,263
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

358
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:17,900
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

359
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,324
â™«  Blooming roses, gorgeous yet wither  â™«

360
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:25,305
â™«  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

361
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:31,300
â™«  Roses reveal a hidden ambiguity  â™«

362
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,176
â™«  Roses are the most dangerous yet noble  â™«

363
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:37,275
â™«  Roses are the most powerful and most beautiful  â™«

364
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:39,409
â™«  Roses carve fearlessness with their domination  â™«

365
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:41,249
Zheng Shuyi.

366
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:44,205
Zheng Shuyi.

367
00:25:57,368 --> 00:25:58,669
 Zheng Shuyi, 

368
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,889
 what's in your head? 

369
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:19,109
It's cold. Where is your hat?

370
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:21,929
Thank you.

371
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:27,908
Are you passing by or are you coming to me specifically?

372
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,528
It's almost midnight.

373
00:26:32,528 --> 00:26:34,449
I live in Bogang Cloudy Bay.

374
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:37,169
How could I be passing by?

375
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,689
How was the movie?

376
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,268
Then, why did you come back so late?

377
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:53,568
Is Cloud Innovation's feature ready?

378
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,469
You got my authorization yesterday.

379
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,969
But you came home so late today.

380
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:05,509
Mr. Shi, you're not here to urge me to finish the feature. Right?

381
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:09,409
Don't worry. I've been preparing for it for a long time.

382
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:11,829
I'm sure nothing will go wrong.

383
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:16,289
I am off duty.

384
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,568
I can watch any movie I want.

385
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:21,409
I can play as late as I want.

386
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:25,009
I am an independent adult.

387
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,609
You don't want to sleep.

388
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:30,088
But you don't have to come to me to make me work.

389
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:39,109
Why are you looking at me like that?

390
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:01,289
Who did you go to the movie with?

391
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,769
- My mom. 
 - Where's your mom?

392
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:08,608
My momâ€¦

393
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:11,608
My momâ€¦

394
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,668
    
 Here's my mom.

395
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:24,149
 Yi, why haven't you gotten home yet? 

396
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,889
I am coming up.

397
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,889
My mom called me. I have to go.

398
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,820
 The door is unlocked. 

399
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:48,649
It's Guan Xiangcheng.

400
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:52,368
Yes, he's an idol of Financial Introduction.

401
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:55,348
 The journalist is amazing. 

402
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:58,569
 She interviewed Guan Xiangcheng. 
   

403
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,049
Thank you.

404
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,908
Yes. Thank you for your support over the years.

405
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:08,590
Mr. Wang.

406
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:10,969
Thank you.

407
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:13,708
Shuyi is great.

408
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,689
Hello, Mr. Li.

409
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,848
Long time.

410
00:29:21,048 --> 00:29:21,969
Okay, Brother.

411
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,269
I will ask Chen Sheng to contact her.

412
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,899
   

413
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,188
Come in here.

414
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:51,948
Mr. Shi.

415
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:54,329
Mr. Qin wants to set up an interview with Ms. Zheng.

416
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,848
- Please contact her. 
 - Okay.

417
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:01,249
Don't tell her it's Mr. Qin.

418
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,709
Tell her it's a friend of mine.

419
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:05,509
See if she can set it up.

420
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:07,128
Noted.

421
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:12,129
A friend of Mr. Shi?

422
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:14,428
Was it Mr. Shi who asked you to contact me?

423
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:17,289
 Yes. Mr. Shi's friend contacted him. 

424
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,409
 And Mr. Shi asked me to contact you. 

425
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:23,449
But I'm all booked up.

426
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:28,689
How about this? I have a colleague who is great at interviews.

427
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:31,129
I'll give you her contact information.

428
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,829
So you can introduce her to Mr. Shi's friend. Is that okay?

429
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,189
 Okay. That's fine. 

430
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:36,729
 Thank you. 

431
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:38,349
No worries.

432
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,948
What's the big deal?

433
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:47,929
She's taking advantage of Guan Xiangcheng.

434
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,844
Whoever interviews Guan Xiangcheng will thrive.

435
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,328
You're right.

436
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:58,509
Can you get the chance to interview Guan Xiangcheng?

437
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:07,188
We will see.

438
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:11,689
Come in.

439
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,089
Chief Editor, you wanted to see me?

440
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:19,009
Pass me the water.

441
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:32,428
Do you know why I asked you to pass me the water?

442
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:37,269
You have been wanted on the phone the whole morning.

443
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,090
Me?

444
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,430
Yes. They wanted you to write interviews.

445
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,188
What are your plans?

446
00:31:47,249 --> 00:31:49,109
Things are different.

447
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:52,749
In short, you went viral.

448
00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:57,669
I was in a car accident before.

449
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:00,549
It's a new energy vehicle. It uses Zhanlan's batteries.

450
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:03,328
Zhanlan is raising a new round of financing. I thinkâ€¦

451
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,469
Zheng Shuyi,

452
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:08,429
don't you know it's a good opportunity?

453
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:10,088
Many people want you to interview them.

454
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:11,689
All you have to do is write more articles.

455
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:14,848
Then you will become the deputy editor.

456
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:19,129
When I become the deputy editor,

457
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,489
can I work on the e-newsletter?

458
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:23,768
Look at you.

459
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:25,548
I am talking to a dead phone.

460
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:28,368
What about these manuscripts?

461
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:30,508
Don't worry, Ms. Yi.

462
00:32:30,508 --> 00:32:32,689
I will take care of it.

463
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,468
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

464
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:41,862
Nannan.

465
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:45,829
An important partner of Cloud Innovation wants to set up an interview.

466
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:46,869
Are you interested in it?

467
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:49,528
If you're interested, I will give him your WeChat.

468
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:52,549
It's a good chance.

469
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:55,149
I think they want you to do it.

470
00:32:55,149 --> 00:32:57,229
The interviewee makes short videos.

471
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:59,088
You're better than me in this field.

472
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:00,709
I am working on another topic.

473
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,449
I don't have time to do that.

474
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,048
All right.

475
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,269
What's in your mind?

476
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:10,449
Why did you refer me to such an important client?

477
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,129
It's easy money.

478
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:14,237
Don't you want it?

479
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:17,748
I have many chances. But I can't take them all.

480
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:21,649
I told Ms. Yi to distribute my interviews.

481
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:24,009
You want to distribute all of them?

482
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,949
You've finished Guan Xiangcheng's interview.

483
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:30,368
Why don't you keep some important interviews?

484
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,629
If I have an idea, I will contact them.

485
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,468
They always have a need.

486
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:37,948
Zheng Shuyi,

487
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:42,608
you are this close to being the deputy editor?

488
00:33:42,608 --> 00:33:45,048
Why do you say the same thing as Ms. Yi?

489
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:47,309
We are the normal ones, all right?

490
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:48,589
I built up a group for you.

491
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:49,969
Work hard.

492
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:51,649
Thank you.

493
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:59,489
Take a look at these interviews.

494
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:01,209
Tell me if you are interested.

495
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:03,649
- Thank you, Ms. Shuyi. 
 - No worries.

496
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:04,748
- Thank you, Ms. Shuyi. 
 - Thank you, Ms. Shuyi.

497
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:06,737
- Thank you, Ms. Shuyi. 
 - Thank you, Ms. Shuyi.

498
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:08,828
Look at her.

499
00:34:08,828 --> 00:34:10,829
She's not deputy editor yet.

500
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,028
But she arranges work for everyone.

501
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:16,908
Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

502
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,488
Mr. Shi, I've set up Mr. Qin's interview.

503
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:24,489
Ms. Zheng is busy.

504
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:28,709
But she referred me to another journalist and built up a group.

505
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,589
You talked to her on the phone.

506
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,089
And she built a WeChat group for you.

507
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,454
Prepare for a meeting.

508
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:47,829
Cloud Innovation has passed Zhanlanâ€™s first round of financing screening.

509
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:50,929
Shi Yan, good job.

510
00:34:51,808 --> 00:34:55,009
Mr. Shi, it's competitive.

511
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:59,349
If we want to succeed, we have to prepare in advance.

512
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:05,428
If we want to invest in Zhanlan, we can join forces with other investment companies.

513
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:07,489
Investing is all about making money.

514
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:09,608
We can't join forces with others before we make money.

515
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,048
The shortlisted companies are poised to win.

516
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:16,188
It's not easy to join forces with them.

517
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:20,808
I've heard your thoughts and concerns.

518
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:24,049
At the moment, we are only considering whether to invest in Zhanlan.

519
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:25,349
The investment is huge.

520
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:27,268
We can't rush for quick results.

521
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:30,028
I don't agree to take any action

522
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:33,448
until the results of the new evaluation are known.

523
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:50,268
Electronic cash is becoming more and more popular in daily life.

524
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:07,469
All right, guys. That's all for today.

525
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:15,589
Professor Yu, let's have lunch together.

526
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:18,809
I am sorry. I have a class.

527
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,109
What about after class?

528
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:23,022
Mr. Yu.

529
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:26,489
Sorry.

530
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,108
You haven't eaten yet, huh?

531
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:30,808
You have a lot of classes this afternoon.

532
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,589
 Do you have a girlfriend? 

533
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:37,128
 How do you know it's my girlfriend's? 

534
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:42,929
Please tell me it's not what I think it is.

535
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:47,577
Yue, you are back.

536
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:55,469
Your manuscript is well-structured and clear.

537
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:58,209
Beier, you've made great progress. Keep up the good work.

538
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:00,209
I will, Ms. Yuling.

539
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:02,689
Qin Shiyue, where have you been?

540
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:04,869
What took you so long?

541
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:10,609
Sorry, Ms. Yuling.

542
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:12,269
I went to a class at the University of Finance and Economics.

543
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:13,889
I came back late. Iâ€¦

544
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:15,708
I asked you to finish the manuscript with Beier.

545
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,289
But you left everything to her.

546
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:18,648
What did you do?

547
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:22,849
Your manuscript is very amateurish.

548
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,620
How did Zheng Shuyi teach you?

549
00:37:26,468 --> 00:37:28,669
It's my fault that I came back late.

550
00:37:28,669 --> 00:37:31,908
You can scold me. Don't speak ill of Ms. Shuyi.

551
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:34,089
You want to be a hero?

552
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:36,228
All right.

553
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:39,128
I will only talk about you.

554
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:42,089
What did you do in writing this manuscript?

555
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:45,729
Ms. Yuling, Yue contacted the expert.

556
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,109
And she wrote the frame of the manuscript.

557
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:48,809
She gave me the frame before she went out.

558
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,288
Don't interrupt me.

559
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,429
As a senior, can't I teach her a lesson?

560
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:57,809
You are great.

561
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:58,949
All right.

562
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:01,188
Find more industry leaders

563
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:04,729
and ask them to give you rookies some advice.

564
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:11,189
Since the expert made a point for you, you should rebuild the frame.

565
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,149
Beier, you build the frame.

566
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:16,109
I don't want people to say that I have an uneven division of labor.

567
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,688
All right. I got it.

568
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:24,408
Go for it.

569
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:28,088
Yue.

570
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:29,969
It's all my fault.

571
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:31,668
I didn't write the content well.

572
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:33,588
It's not your fault, nor your problem.

573
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:35,609
Don't take it to heart.

574
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,430
You had a long day, Yue.

575
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:06,528
Ms. Nan, when will Ms. Yue come back?

576
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:08,949
She's out in the field. She's busy.

577
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:12,168
It took her a few hours to reply to my message.

578
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:14,228
Forget it. I won't contact her.

579
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,168
I don't want to bother her.

580
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:17,594
Don't work too late.

581
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:20,089
See you. Cheer up.

582
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,329
 Don't interrupt me. 

583
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,009
 As a senior, can't I teach her a lesson? 

584
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:39,148
 Uncle, I want to quit. 

585
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:40,969
 What's wrong? 

586
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:47,589
Uncle, you have no idea what kind of dire straits I'm in.

587
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:49,669
I'm working overtime.

588
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:53,329
 Now I am just a rootless weed, allowing others to bully me, 

589
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:56,709
 My pride as a Shi family member is almost gone. 

590
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:58,449
 Uncle, you know what? 

591
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:01,749
 You can see the words fly when you are hungry. 

592
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:04,628
My stomach is upset.

593
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:06,949
I only ate some cookies.

594
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,788
I can't hold on for too much longer.

595
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:17,608
 Are you all working overtime? 

596
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:19,209
Only me.

597
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,229
My leader didn't come to the magazine today.

598
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:23,788
 She doesn't have time to care about me. 

599
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,329
She's not working overtime.

600
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:31,888
She didn't go to the magazine.

601
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,248
Where did she go?

602
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:38,608
   

603
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:39,729
 I am working overtime. 

604
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,549
 Would you like to have a midnight snack together. 

605
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:56,649
 Professor Yu, you must be tired. 

606
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:05,969
"How do you know it's my girlfriend's?"

607
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:08,568
I was thinking too much.

608
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:13,088
I have to dig deep.

609
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:16,088
I need to find out how many competitors I have.

610
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,248
I don't know if he's still there.

611
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:22,628
 - Professor Yu, bye-bye. 
 - Professor Yu, bye-bye. 

612
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:24,048
 - Take care.  
 - Professor Yu, bye-bye.

613
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,228
- See you. 
 - I will get some water.

614
00:41:25,228 --> 00:41:28,289
- Professor Yu. 
 - Ms. Qin.

615
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:30,728
You must be thirsty. Have some water.

616
00:41:30,728 --> 00:41:32,909
No, thanks. I have water.

617
00:41:34,248 --> 00:41:35,708
Is the game over?

618
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,589
Let's have dinner together.

619
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:39,829
I have some questions for you.

620
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:42,949
If you have any questions, you can ask me in class.

621
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:45,028
No.

622
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:49,168
It's a question about relationships.

623
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:51,889
Ms. Qin, I don't think you know me well.

624
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:53,709
I am 30.

625
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:56,929
- So? 
 - Soâ€¦

626
00:41:56,929 --> 00:41:59,929
I may not be the best person to answer your relationship questions.

627
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:01,628
I don't think so.

628
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:05,888
Aren't you straight?

629
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:08,649
I have to prepare my classes. Excuse me.

630
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:09,848
Take care on the way home.

631
00:42:09,848 --> 00:42:12,849
But you haven't answered my question.

632
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:17,169
Right or not, you should get to know and get along with each other first.
