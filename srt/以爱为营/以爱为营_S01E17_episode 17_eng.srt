 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,900
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,425
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:38,600
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,100
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,725
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,225
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,411
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,950
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,425
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,525
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,475
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,100
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,911
   

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,419
Are you hungry?

23
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,340
No, I'm not hungry. You go on.

24
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,580
But I'm hungry.

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,100
So what should we eat?

26
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,400
It's up to you.

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,639
What's wrong?

28
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,380
Nothing.

29
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:00,860
I'm telling you this is the best hotpot restaurant.

30
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,680
It's not a fancy place but the food is so good.

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,400
Let's go.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
Sit.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,059
Please be seated, Mr. Shi.

34
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,255
Do you want beef tripe?

35
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:00,988
Duck sausage?

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,873
What about duck's blood?

37
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,063
Pig brains, too?

38
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,539
You eat all these?

39
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,979
When I came with Shanshan, we sometimes ordered two servings.

40
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,220
- Take a look. 
 - No need. You go on.

41
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,900
You know what? Other than Shanshan, you are the first person who can eat with me.

42
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,328
You actually like to eat everything I love to eat.

43
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,380
You're really a hmmm-monster.

44
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,500
Luckily this hmmm-monster has the same taste as me.

45
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,440
What did you say?

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,159
It's nothing. I said you have good taste.

47
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,539
I'm done.

48
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:03,580
Got it.

49
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,439
Two more aprons, please.

50
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,520
- Wait a moment. 
 - Thank you.

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,319
Here. My secret ingredient.

52
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,940
Are you sure this is edible?

53
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,979
Definitely! It's a combination of an internet secret recipe

54
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:25,099
and my years of experience.

55
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,660
You'll see when you try it later.

56
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,199
Hello.

57
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,079
 Uncle, where are you? 

58
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,120
What's going on?

59
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
 I hit someone with my car. What should I do? 

60
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,639
 Youâ€¦ You come and save me. 

61
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,079
Just calm down and answer my questions.

62
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,199
Where are you? Are you okay?

63
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,279
Was the other party seriously injured? Did you call the police?

64
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,040
 I'm at the University of Finance and Economics. I'm fine. 

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,639
 He doesn't seem to be in any trouble. 

66
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,920
 But he, uh, he wouldn't let me call the police. 

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,160
Take it easy. Tell me what happened.

68
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,759
 I went there to look for someone and parked on the side of the road. 

69
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,920
 Suddenly an old man screamed. 

70
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,000
 I got out and found him lying next to my car covering his leg and screaming. 

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,399
 While I was parked, 

72
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,119
I really didn't see anyone in the rear-view mirror.

73
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,759
I went to help him and he said he couldn't move.

74
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,880
Then he put his leg over my wheel

75
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,640
and wouldn't let me go or call the police.

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,600
It hurts like hell. My leg is broken!

77
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,480
Now he's holding his leg.

78
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,879
He said I broke his leg.

79
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,519
 Is he bleeding? 

80
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,520
No. No.

81
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,360
He won't let you call the police.

82
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,079
Did you call an ambulance?

83
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,820
 Not yet. 

84
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,300
Hey, do something!

85
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,760
You hit me and you're leaving me alone.

86
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,339
What's wrong with young people these days?

87
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,759
It hurts.

88
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
Uncle, come quickly!

89
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,160
My parents aren't in Jiangcheng.

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
Iâ€¦ I don't know what to do now.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I know. Don't panic and don't touch him.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,059
Go back to your car and sit down.

93
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,580
Are you leaving?

94
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,839
I'll get the check first.

95
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,240
What's so urgent at this hour of the night?

96
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,720
My niece is looking for me.

97
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,460
Your niece?

98
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,020
But you didn't take a bite.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,660
But something's happened to my niece and I must go.

100
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,079
What's wrong with her?

101
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,959
The details are not very clear but she probably met a fraud.

102
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,979
A fraud?

103
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,680
It's okay. You go ahead.

104
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,160
I can finish the hotpot by myself.

105
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,010
No matter how weird they think I am,

106
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,000
I can eat it by myself and take a cab home alone.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,959
Don't worry about it.

108
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,240
Are you really sure?

109
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:08,209
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

110
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,920
Have you heard of the world loneliness scale?

111
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,620
Eating hotpot alone is level 5.

112
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,199
But it's okay.

113
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,199
It's better than waiting for you all night at Warner Manor with menstrual cramps.

114
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,759
It's better than standing in Bogang Cloudy Bay for two hours in high heels in a force 7 gale.

115
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,800
It's better than waiting hungrily for you to finish your work this afternoon.

116
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,656
So this is nothing.

117
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,399
It's okay. You go ahead.

118
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,519
After all, I'm an adult with a sound mind.

119
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,919
I won't be cheated even if I eat hotpot here alone.

120
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,977
If you can bear to see me like that, go ahead.

121
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,702
â™«  Roses are the most dangerous yet noble  â™«

122
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:45,682
â™«  Roses are the most powerful and most beautiful  â™«

123
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:50,660
â™«  Roses carve fearlessness with their domination  â™«

124
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,667
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

125
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,039
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

126
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,220
- Go on. 
 - You're not leaving?

127
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
I'm not leaving.

128
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,399
Really?

129
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,120
I can't bear to see you like this.

130
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,413
â™«  Bitter and hurt  â™«

131
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:14,513
   

132
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't want to miss your wonderful acting.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,154
I think you're a better actress than that fraud.

134
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:28,514
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

135
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,939
Eat before it gets cold.

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,240
What are you doing? You're running away after hitting me?

137
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,839
- Stop her for me! 
 - I'm not.

138
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,039
I parked normally. I didn't hit you at all.

139
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,059
Look, everybody! She's trying to deny it.

140
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,960
I'd better call an ambulance for you.

141
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,740
We should ask the police to decide who is fully responsible.

142
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm not going to the hospital. I can't afford to see a doctor.

143
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,179
What do you want?

144
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,720
How can you tell where you're hurt if you don't go to the hospital.

145
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,080
Orâ€¦ you can give me money and I'll go home and find a doctor myself.

146
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,799
He's a fraud, isn't he?

147
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,759
He just thinks this girl is easy to cheat.

148
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,720
You're so loud after being hit. You seem just fine.

149
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,319
It hurts. It hurts.

150
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,060
Are you moving or not? Come on, move!

151
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,639
I think she's a college girl.

152
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh my, I'm sure she'll be blackmailed.

153
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,439
- Let's go. Let's take a look. 
 - Let's go.

154
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,259
Qin Shiyue?

155
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,240
You should compensate me with 5,000 yuan. Not a penny less.

156
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Otherwise, no one can leave today.

157
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,720
This girlâ€¦

158
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,480
It's impossible. Dream on!

159
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,440
You look like you're rich, rich but heartless!

160
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,799
Okay, if you don't compensate me, then I'll call the police to arrest you.

161
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,320
Sure, let's call the police.

162
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,199
Let's see if the police wil arrest you or me.

163
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,360
All right, stop it. Argue somewhere else if you must.

164
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,919
Grandpa, it doesn't look like you're seriously hurt.

165
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,799
Miss, why don't you give him 1,000 yuan?

166
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,060
- Consider buying your way out. 
 - Yeah, right.

167
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,059
No! I need at least 2,000 yuan. Not one penny less!

168
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:19,279
Miss, give him 2,000 yuan.

169
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,759
Don't block the way and waste our time.

170
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,200
Look at the traffic jam.

171
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,399
Yeah, that's right.

172
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,799
 But sometimes money can't solve everything. 

173
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,740
 I measure something by whether it should be done and if it's worth it. 

174
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
It's not even a matter of money.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If it's my fault, whether it's 5,000 yuan or 50,000 yuan, I'll pay it.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But if it's not my fault, I won't pay anyone!

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,400
I've worked hard for my money, too.

178
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,800
My family's money is also earned by my family through their hard work.

179
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,200
I won't and can't spend money where it shouldn't be spent.

180
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,900
- It's not much money. Give it to him. 
 - Yes.

181
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,600
She is not wrong. Why should she pay?

182
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Why don't you give this man money if you think it's not much money?

183
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
It's none of my business.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,300
This car is parked in a parking space.

185
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,000
I think it should be clear to everyone who is actually obstructing traffic.

186
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
There's supposed to be a camera on this car.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Sir, if you insist on calling the police, I can help you.

188
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Once the police have arrived and checked the footage, everything will be clear.

189
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
But I have to warn you.

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,900
Serious cases of fraud will be treated as blackmail.

191
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,400
But my leg doesn't hurt so much.

193
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,600
I'm just trying to be nice since you're just a little girl.

194
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,900
This old rat.

195
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,399
Let's go.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,600
Professor Yu, thank you.

197
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,400
Don't mention it.

198
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,800
You did the right thing.

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
- Well, thenâ€¦ 
 - I'm leaving.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,600
You go home too and be safe.

201
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,700
Iâ€¦

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Then let me invite you to dinner next time.

203
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Miss Qin.

204
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,300
Chen Sheng?

205
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,200
Why is it you?

206
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Okay, I got it.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Uncle, where have you been?

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
Why didn't you pick me up just now?

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,400
So you got it all worked out for yourself?

210
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,800
Yep.

211
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Thanks to a nice gentleman.

212
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,600
Then you should thank him properly.

213
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,600
By the way, who were you visiting at the University of Finance and Economics today?

214
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Uh, nobody. Uh, just a friend.

215
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,400
Uncle, you went for hotpot.

216
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,500
Who else but my mom can make you eat hotpot?

217
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,200
It couldn't be my "auntie," right?

218
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,400
What did you say?

219
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,000
You've never liked hotpot and hated the heavy smell.

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,200
Yet you had hotpot today and even picked the dish with the most lasting smell.

221
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,600
Who's so important that you can eat hotpot with her?

222
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,400
That will have to be my future "auntie".

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,100
You did a great job today.

224
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,800
You must be tired, too. Get some rest.

225
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
You're right. It stinks.

226
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
I should take a shower.

227
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,200
How long has it been since my uncle patted my head?

228
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,400
Why is he so gentle all of a sudden?

229
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Oh my! He didn't say I was wrong!

230
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,200
Something's going on.

231
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Hello.

232
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
 Shuyi, come sing with us! 

233
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,500
 It's Zhuang's birthday today. We're singing karaoke. 

234
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
I'm not going. I just got home.

235
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,000
 You just got home? You worked overtime today? 

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
No. I just came back from hotpot.

237
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,400
 Were you with Shi Yan? 

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,500
When you were in school you used to say "You'd be the first to get married."

239
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,900
You said you'd be my maid of honor.

240
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,400
All right, I must hang up.

241
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Bye.

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,900
Why didn't you text me back?

243
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,000
Probably because I have too many messages to handle.

244
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,100
I need to talk to you.

245
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Shanshan.

246
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
What are you doing? Everyone's waiting for you. Come on.

247
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I said I need to talk to you.

248
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,500
- What are you doing? 
 - Zhuang, it's okay. It's all fine.

249
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,000
Shanshan.

250
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
I really need to talk to you.

251
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
Guan Ji, what are you doing?

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Whenever you lose a game, you run away.

253
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,000
Hurry up. Beibei is waiting for you to drink.

254
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,100
- Let's go back. 
 - Let's go.

255
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,000
- Let's go back. 
 - Let's go.

256
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Shanshan.

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Let's go. Let's go.

258
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,300
Come on.

259
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,100
Stop looking.

260
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,800
He's still soft deep in his heart.

261
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,100
If he was really heartless, he could have just walked away.

262
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,000
But he didn't.

263
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,400
Come to think of it, we're really destined for each other.

264
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,000
He did me such a big favor. I should invite him out to dinner.

265
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah. I have to take him out to dinner.

266
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,500
 I'm home. Thank you for today. 

267
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,200
 Your help is definitely worth a meal. 

268
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,600
 When would be a good time for I me to take you out to dinner? 

269
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
 Okay. 

270
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,000
He said okay! Finally!

271
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
 I remember you like Yubao Pavilion's food. 

272
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,600
 Let's go there? 

273
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,000
 Why don't I pick a place? 

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Sure, definitely. 

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Sister Shuyi, good morning.

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,700
Good morning, Shiyue.

277
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,500
Why are you here so early today?

278
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,300
Because I was too excited to sleep, I came early.

279
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,500
Excited? Why?

280
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,200
Because what happened yesterday was so fabulous!

281
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,600
No matter what, he should've gone and helped out.

282
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,400
You're such a young girl. People could've bullied you.

283
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
What a bad uncle!

284
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
He was probably enchanted by some mysterious lady.

285
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,700
That's even worse.

286
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,600
Who can be more important than one's dear niece?

287
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
If this was in ancient times,

288
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,800
he could have been a bad emperor bewitched by an evil concubine.

289
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,600
You're so right!

290
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,800
What happened then?

291
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Later, I remembered something someone told me:

292
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
"Money can't solve everything."

293
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,800
So I told the grandpa that I earned my money through hard work.

294
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,400
I told him I could give him money if it was my fault.

295
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,100
But if it wasn't my fault, I wouldn't give a penny.

296
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,700
Nice job!

297
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,200
But I feel that you're missing a hero in this story.

298
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,900
You're right.

299
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,600
Though I said that the grandpa wouldn't leave.

300
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,000
At this critical moment, a man suddenly emerged from the crowd.

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,500
He was like a knight coming to a princess's rescue.

302
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,800
He said to the onlookers who wanted me to give the old man money:

303
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,700
"Since you think that's not much, why don't you give money to the man?"

304
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,200
And then he threatened to call the police.

305
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,500
The old man got up and left. And then the crowd dispersed.

306
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,000
Soâ€¦ you have a crush on him?

307
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,800
He feels for you, too?

308
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
I guess so.

309
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,700
It's good since it goes both ways.

310
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,400
But I'm telling you, Shiyue don't let romance disturb your work.

311
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
Don't worry, Shuyi.

312
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,500
I want to do my best both romantically and professionally.

313
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
But that uncle of yours is really too much.

314
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Luckily your knight arrived.

315
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
But my uncle's really not to blame.

316
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,400
It's my future "auntie's" fault if you must say so.

317
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,500
Shuyi, it's getting cold. Remember to stay warm.

318
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,480
Mom, I just fell out of love.

319
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't start a new relationship that fast.

320
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Ugh. I can't try it again. What if I meet another cheater?

321
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm not going. No.

322
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,500
If I really wanted to be in a relationship, I could find a lot of decent gentlemen.

323
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,800
Okay, I'm hanging up. I'm at work.

324
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,400
What's the matter? Are your parents asking you to go on a blind date?

325
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,600
Isn't it obvious?

326
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,600
You're so reluctant.

327
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,100
Don't tell me you want to get back together with that guy.

328
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,800
That's impossible!

329
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,000
A man cheats once, and his fidelity's gone for good.

330
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's a relief.

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,800
My mom has nothing better to do.

332
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,900
I just broke up but she won't even give me a break.

333
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,000
So is my mom.

334
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,400
A few days ago, she suddenly came over and dragged me to dinner and a movie with a guy.

335
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,500
A matchmaking surprise!

336
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,700
Sister Nan. Sister Shuyi.

337
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
What are you talking about?

338
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,600
We're talking about blind dates.

339
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,300
Blind dates?

340
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Sister Shuyi, are you going on a blind date, too?

341
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,700
Yeah, that's right.

342
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,100
You two talk first. The chief editor is asking for me.

343
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,000
How's your blind date? Is he handsome? Is he rich?

344
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,800
He's quite handsome.

345
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,600
Is he better than my uncle?

346
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,200
He seems to be as good as your uncle.

347
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,800
What about other respects?

348
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,300
He's also good in other respects. His academic achievement is impressive.

349
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,800
A rich and handsome man.

350
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,300
A knowledgeable and handsome man.

351
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,200
That's a tough choice, Shuyi.

352
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,800
Actually, I haven't compared them.

353
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
You're right.

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Relationships are all about feelings.

355
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,600
Rich people aren't necessarily good, are they?

356
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,572
No, no, no.

357
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:34,219
You uncle is still very good.

358
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,800
Shuyi, you're such a charming lady.

359
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,580
Don't jump to conclusions too soon.

360
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,780
They say it takes time to truly know someone.

361
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,682
We all have the right to make friends.

362
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:45,140
You can make more friends.

363
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,359
See who is more suitable for you. And then get along with them.

364
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,119
Don't give up the whole forest for one tree.

365
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,619
Even when you play a video game, you'll have to challenge different dungeons.

366
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:57,102
You have to take your time and pick your man carefully.

367
00:22:57,102 --> 00:23:02,440
Shiyue, I didn't realize you were quite well-versed in this aspect.

368
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,540
Of course. Let's put it this way.

369
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,040
Except for work, there's nothing I'm not good at.

370
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:22,649
To summarize, I don't think investing in Zhanlan is a good choice for Cloud Innovation.

371
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:27,540
Shi Yan, from what you've told me, Jiang Shaoyuan is just a bit arrogant.

372
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,580
Once we invest in Zhanlan, he'll naturally be more polite.

373
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,950
With so many firms interested in Zhanlan,

374
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,380
it's only natural that he'd be a little proud.

375
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,599
Shi Yan, you have big visions.

376
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,939
I don't think there's any point in caring about these side issues. Right?

377
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,359
You asked him so many harsh questions.

378
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,300
It's understandable that he had a bad attitude.

379
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,079
But now there are so many accidents.

380
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:54,599
Can't we learn about the truth now that we're considering investment?

381
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,939
Zhanlan has a great potential now.

382
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:59,459
The evaluation department has also come up with reports.

383
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:02,659
There have been rounds of investigation.

384
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:05,200
Right now, I'd like to know, youâ€¦

385
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,070
What do you mean?

386
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,799
I meanâ€¦

387
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,920
Zhanlan isn't the best choice for us to enter the solid-state battery industry.

388
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,300
Shi Yan, can I take it that you haven't nailed Zhanlan's case?

389
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,820
Zhanlan is now the leading firm in the industry. It's the cream of the crop.

390
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,440
Where are you going to find a better choice than Zhanlan now?

391
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,079
Zhanlan's market share is indeed high.

392
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,780
But that doesn't mean their batteries are flawless.

393
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,079
Of course, I'm not asking that our partner be perfect.

394
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,839
I just want us all to keep progressing together.

395
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,519
But both Yu You and I believe that

396
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,480
Zhanlan will use this round of financing to scale up production.

397
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,559
More problems will occur if they don't solve their technological issues now.

398
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,759
The impact then would be much bigger.

399
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,240
Wait!

400
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,380
You're the one who first suggested we focus on Zhanlan.

401
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:08,130
We put so much effort into Zhanlan because we trusted you.

402
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,739
Then you tell all of us today that it won't work.

403
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:13,659
- Are you kidding me? 
  - Mr. Zhang has a point. 

404
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:16,140
We should be bold with our assumptions and careful with our proof.

405
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,799
We can't turn a blind eye to real problems.

406
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,051
Since you are all so determined, let me ask you this:

407
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:25,939
If there's a problem in the future, who's going to take the blame?

408
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,880
Mr. Shi asked me to come up with a backup plan while he was evaluating Zhanlan.

409
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,280
By comparing and screening, I found other options. We can go over them one by one.

410
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,860
You sound like it's perfect.

411
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,619
Are you sure some random company can be compared to Zhanlan now?

412
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,900
You see? I told you.

413
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,079
They'll not leave you alone if you say no to the investment.

414
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:13,720
But if we invest and lose money, will they leave us alone?

415
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,880
Even now you're in the mood for jokes.

416
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,179
Both evaluation and negotiation take time.

417
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,440
Pitching a new company may not be that fast.

418
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,839
Then, what do we do?

419
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,540
We need to pick up the pace.

420
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,480
We must make Zhanlan's problem clear to them.

421
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,340
That's only if they're willing to listen.

422
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,300
You can solve the game in your own home.

423
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,060
Why are you free to come to my place today?

424
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,379
And you're ignoring me.

425
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,040
Let me guess.

426
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,060
Are Old Zhang and Old Tian bothering you again?

427
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,960
Let me keep guessing.

428
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,980
Did Shi Yan do something?

429
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,400
This piece can't go here.

430
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,240
Look at your bad strategy.

431
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,340
If you put the piece here, we'll lose that area.

432
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,900
Shi Yan hasn't told me what he's thinking.

433
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,780
But Old Tian told me that he initiated the program.

434
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,119
Then he denied it himself.

435
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:31,039
The reason was because of a minor accident.

436
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,200
But Tian and the others' concerns are beyond this one single investment.

437
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,620
They think Shi Yan isn't stable enough, that he doesn't respect them enough.

438
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,600
They still want Cloud Innovation to be managed by people appointed by Xiaoming.

439
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,300
Those old brats.

440
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:59,119
Forget about the Go game.

441
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,419
Take a look at this. 
    

442
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,300
You're so early.

443
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,640
Check this out first.

444
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,920
I already read it.

445
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,039
You did?

446
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,619
However, in the future, for electric cars is ultra-long battery life still necessary?

447
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:21,179
If the charging infrastructure can be improved in the future

448
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,960
and fast-charging technology has a breakthrough

449
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,640
lithium ternary and lithium iron phosphate batteries that we currently use will be enough.

450
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,699
Research on solid-state batteries requires heavy investment.

451
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:34,119
But it is likely that its future gains will be minimal.

452
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,179
You're here early to read me a magazine?

453
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,119
Shuyi is really a good writer.

454
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,860
She must've done a lot of research.

455
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,160
This whole article isn't limited to whether Zhanlan is good or bad.

456
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,100
Rather, it gives us a new perspective.

457
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,680
Maybe solid-state batteries aren't the only choice going forward.

458
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:00,479
I discussed this with her when we went to Zhanlan.

459
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:03,219
Okay.

460
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:06,619
Now that you've read it, I'll go to the conference room first.

461
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,419
By the way, we could eat together sometime.

462
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,820
Let's get her input.

463
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,010
   

464
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,659
Mr. Shi, we're all set for the meeting.

465
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:45,459
You've read the article, right?

466
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:50,440
There's also a copy of the recent accident reports on Hengxin's vehicles.

467
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,720
Shi Yan,

468
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,279
do you now base your investment decisions on magazine articles?

469
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,279
This reporter rings a bell.

470
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,123
She's interviewed you before.

471
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:07,400
You didn't pay her to write this article, did you?

472
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,720
Mr. Zhang, this is Financial Introduce we're talking about.

473
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,380
They're as old as Mingyu.

474
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,960
You must think so highly of Shi Yan to think he could've bribed them.

475
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,319
I was joking.

476
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,840
Shi Yan, we all trust you.

477
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,680
But what do you suggest now?

478
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,720
We read the article.

479
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,519
This reporter has a hypothesis.

480
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,240
But I think that's even less plausible than solid-state batteries.

481
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,179
So you're saying you want to give up this industry?

482
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:44,400
Whether it is to follow the market demand or the strategy of the state,

483
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,100
the R&amp;D of safer higher-energy batteries is a must.

484
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,859
Any investment is going to be risky.

485
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:55,939
The risk itself is why investment is attractive.

486
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:59,640
So we won't give up this industry.

487
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,540
I agree with Shi Yan.

488
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,039
Solid-state batteries have potential.

489
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,620
We'll not give up.

490
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,340
Our country needs more environmentally-friendly batteries.

491
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,200
The market needs batteries with lower cost.

492
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
The public needs safer, high-energy batteries.

493
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,739
By investing solid-state batteries,

494
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:24,319
we aim to help companies develop batteries that meet all said needs.

495
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,839
But this investment requires a long time. So we must be patient.

496
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,699
I'm going overseas in a couple of days.

497
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:35,699
I'll visit the state-of-the-art all-solid-state battery research laboratory.

498
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,739
All departments will also get the results of my visit and investigation.

499
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:41,540
Then we can choose a program that is more suitable for us.

500
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,559
The lead editor called and praised you.

501
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,440
That was a great article.

502
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,380
The lead editor also asked when the Cloud Innovation feature would be available.

503
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,459
Soon, very soon.

504
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:00,319
The lead editor also gave a suggestion for you to consider.

505
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,699
Maybe we can have paid reading for the feature.

506
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,459
Is that okay?

507
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:10,441
The lead editor is so up-to-date. That's a great idea.

508
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,599
Do your best.

509
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,300
If this attempt is successful,

510
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,659
I'm sure the lead editor will reconsider the independent e-magazine.

511
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,559
After all, it may be able to finance itself.

512
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,939
Thank you, Sister Yi.

513
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,659
 I think Xiaguang Temple is a blessed place. 

514
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,820
 One of the things I've been working on is finally making progress. 

515
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,419
 Didn't you ask about romance there? 

516
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,119
 So it's you who brought me luck. 

517
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,939
 The lead editor said Cloud Innovation's first feature could have a pay-to-read service. 

518
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:05,799
This article came at the right time.

519
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:08,179
Old Tian and Old Zhang didn't refute at all.

520
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:13,880
Yes, her article is very insightful and her point is sharp.

521
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,980
   

522
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,480
Do you have any plans for Friday?

523
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,559
I've asked some of my single friends over. Are you joining me for New Year's Eve?

524
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,079
I'm going to be with loved ones on that day.

525
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,160
Grandpa, dad, mom, uncle, and some friends.

526
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,380
Fine. What about you?

527
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,960
I've been too busy lately and have had no time to think.

528
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,599
Think fast. There's only a few days left.

529
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,440
Don't end up being alone.

530
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,279
Got it!

531
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,960
 Mr. Shi, what's on the agenda for Friday? 

532
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,299
 Let's go camping and watch the stars on New Year's Eve? 

533
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,120
 I have to go on a business trip tomorrow. 

534
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,660
 Wait for me to get back. 

535
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,079
 Okay. 

536
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,719
Shuyi, do you have any plans?

537
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,480
No.

538
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,559
Don't worry.

539
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,884
Our family gathers only for New Year's Eve.

540
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:49,719
I can go shopping with you during the day.

541
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,979
You can also join me for New Year's Eve at night.

542
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:56,180
No need. Let's just go shopping together during the day.

543
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,940
All right, then.

544
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:21,677
 Did you leave? 

545
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:23,177
 Hm. 

546
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,180
 Since we can't watch the stars together on New Year's Eve 

547
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,519
 why don't we watch them together now? 

548
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,803
 I miss you. 

549
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,939
 I miss you, too. 

550
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:44,880
 See that? 

551
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,179
 Have a smooth journey. 

552
00:35:53,054 --> 00:35:56,754
   

553
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:03,660
It's the middle of the holiday.

554
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,479
Shuyi, I'm not surprised you've got no date.

555
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,439
But Shiyue, you're so young yet you're single?

556
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,660
That's strange!

557
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,559
You make it sound like you're in a relationship.

558
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,920
Aren't you shopping with us too?

559
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,419
Dear friends go hand in hand. She who's first in love is a bad doggy!

560
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:22,619
- I don't want a boyfriend, but you simply can't get one! 
 - Who's a bad doggy!

561
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,039
- How come Iâ€¦ 
 - You're a bad doggy!

562
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,040
I'd love to spend the day with someone.

563
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,039
Tell me what kind of man you have in mind.

564
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,499
I'll give you a couple of tips to get him.

565
00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:36,859
Really?

566
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:40,100
Shanshan, tell me! Right now!

567
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:46,668
   
   

568
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,851
   

569
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:00,190
   

570
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,719
I get it.

571
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,799
Shuyi, let's check that out.

572
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,360
 Are you up yet? 

573
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,840
 Have you got time tonight? 

574
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,079
 Do you have a date tonight? 

575
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,139
 Will you celebrate New Year's Eve with me tonight? 

576
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,239
Sister Shuyi. Sister Shanshan. You go home first.

577
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,119
I bought nothing today. I want to shop a bit longer.

578
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,440
Okay, we're going home. You go on.

579
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,779
- Happy New Year! 
 - Happy New Year!

580
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:55,819
Happy New Year!

581
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:58,339
Go get your sweetheart.

582
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,699
- Let's go. 
 - Bye.

583
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,740
Professor Yu!

584
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,260
Ms. Qin, what a coincidence!

585
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,920
Yeah, what a coincidence! Are you here to buy something?

586
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,679
Yes.

587
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,580
You're alone?

588
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:32,480
My cousin's getting married and I want to buy her a wedding gift.

589
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,780
You haven't bought one yet?

590
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,880
Not yet.

591
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,079
I don't go to the mall much so I haven't picked the right gift yet.

592
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,960
I'll help you choose. I know this mall very well.

593
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,319
Just tell me what you want.

594
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:52,599
Well, thank you.

595
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,500
Let me help you with that.

596
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,940
Thank you for offering to help.

597
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,300
What's the matter?

598
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,320
Could you please hold one more thing for me?

599
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,300
What should I hold?

600
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,079
My hand.

601
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,579
Why don't we go with this one? The lily of the valley.

602
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:36,440
The flower symbolizes "happiness returns." What a nice message.

603
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,919
That sounds good. I'll take it.

604
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,779
Hello.

605
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,079
Here's our New Year's dating offer.

606
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,440
With a purchase of 399 yuan or more, you can win this couple's mug.

607
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
Miss and Mister, do you want to participate?

608
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,640
- Yes. 
 - No.

609
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:03,260
It's so cute. I want it.

610
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,000
Wellâ€¦

611
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,679
Hello. Our purchase should be just enough. I'll take one.

612
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,639
Pull for from here.

613
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,599
Miss, your boyfriend really dotes on you.

614
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,900
Here you go. One for each of us.

615
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,679
You can keep both since you like them.

616
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:34,560
Consider it a thank-you gift for helping me pick the present.

617
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,539
So it's a thank-you giftâ€¦

618
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:44,280
Well, why not buy me lunch?

619
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,960
I have a train to catch. I'm really running out of time today.

620
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,340
All right, then.

621
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,920
Well, let's wait until you get back.

622
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,800
Let's go.

623
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,639
When can I really invite him for a meal?

624
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,360
How long has it been since we had hotpot at home?

625
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,719
Last time I checkedâ€¦

626
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,600
What's going on?

627
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,399
Shi Yan.

628
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:24,059
Shi Yan went abroad. Didn't I tell you?

629
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:25,397
I arranged everything.

630
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:28,720
It turned out that he'd be out of the country on New Year's Eve.

631
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,380
He's not abroad.

632
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,039
There he is.

633
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:40,926
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

634
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:43,793
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

635
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,919
