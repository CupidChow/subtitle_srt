 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,425
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:38,600
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,100
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,625
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,225
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,411
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,425
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,525
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,575
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,300
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,100
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,275
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,911
   

22
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:51,540
Did you give Mr. Fan the wrong address?

23
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,840
He couldn't make it.

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,740
He couldn't make it?

25
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,840
I'll take a cab.

26
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,840
I don't ride in other people's cars.

27
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,799
So we keep waiting?

28
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,879
You can walk.

29
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,500
Walk?

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,680
Really? It's a bit far.

31
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,386
It's so cozy here.

32
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:26,639
It's a nice place for retirement.

33
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,180
Your career's taking off and you're thinking about retirement.

34
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,947
The good life is the driving force behind hard work of human beings.

35
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:41,780
I don't know why when I'm walking with you looking at the river, I think of my future.

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,120
â™«  A cool night at twilight  â™«

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,786
So what else do you have planned?

38
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:57,350
â™«  A red candle beside me for warmth  â™«

39
00:02:58,372 --> 00:03:05,285
â™«  Every passing scene is all related to you  â™«

40
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:12,150
â™«  My heart harbors no regret  â™«

41
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:21,667
â™«  Amidst countless wonders  â™«

42
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:28,270
â™«  I never look back  â™«

43
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,836
â™«  Raindrops dance on eaves  â™«

44
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:36,007
â™«  The place where I suddenly look back  â™«

45
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:42,880
â™«  There you are, amidst dimming lights  â™«

46
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,715
â™«  I am destined to be with you  â™«

47
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:58,487
â™«  Love rings are exchanged on the ring fingers  â™«

48
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:02,254
â™«  I wish there were no partings in this world  â™«

49
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:06,669
â™«  May the drifting boat dock to its shore  â™«

50
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:15,670
â™«  May lovers eventually reach perfection  â™«

51
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:25,090
â™«  And never change in this life  â™«

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,315
You better have a reason for calling me.

53
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:32,619
 Sorry, wrong number, wrong number. 

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,519
Why is uncle so scary?

55
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,116
It's so late. What's this about?

56
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,025
Could it be thatâ€¦?

57
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,405
I ruined his big moment?

58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,879
Maybe he's dating his girlfriend.

59
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,000
Maybeâ€¦

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Shiyue, what are you doing?

61
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,319
I'm thinkingâ€¦ When you call a man

62
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,759
if he's impatient and doesn't want to talk to you

63
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,440
then he's probably with a woman.

64
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:21,159
What do you think about every day in that little head of yours?

65
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,339
Hello.

66
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:28,879
 What happened? I'm busy. 

67
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,160
- I'm off duty. 
  - I have things to do. 

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,720
 I'll hang up now. I'll talk to you later. 

69
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,040
Are you sure?

70
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,319
Huh?

71
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,680
Are you sure about what you just said about men's reactions?

72
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,339
I'm sure.

73
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,580
So tell me about this:

74
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,759
What would a man say if he was with another woman?

75
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,120
He'd say, "I'm busy."

76
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,920
And he'd get impatient and ask you what's up.

77
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,979
That checks out.

78
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,500
Why are you so interested in this all of a sudden?

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,160
Nothing. I'm just asking.

80
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,100
I'll be off then.

81
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:35,259
 Professor Yu, did you get my surprise gift? 

82
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,120
Surprise gift?

83
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,199
Yes, I did.

84
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,879
Did you buy these albums?

85
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,659
 They're too valuable. You have my gratitude. 

86
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,739
 But please take them back next time you come to school. 

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,920
 What one likes is priceless. 

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,720
 And these didn't cost anything. 

89
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:04,449
   

90
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,900
   

91
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,620
 If you haven't eaten, let me buy you the dinner. I owe you one, remember? 

92
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,484
 I'm sure you haven't tried many restaurants since you've just been back home. 

93
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,564
 I know all the good restaurants in Jiang City. 

94
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,599
 I'll buy you anything you like. 

95
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:31,360
 I'm sorry, I don't have time tonight. 

96
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,340
Why did he reject me again?

97
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,419
 It's okay. I can wait until you're done. 

98
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,160
 Or shall we go to a restaurant near your school? 

99
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,959
 I'm sure you'll have dinner anyway. 

100
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,220
 Thank you, but there's no need. I'll just go to the school cafeteria. 

101
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,739
That's not a polite refusal. That's an outright refusal.

102
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:07,720
He didn't even make up a reason.

103
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,160
I've got a idea!

104
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:42,822
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

105
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,312
â™«  It's your shining eyes  â™«

106
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:51,666
â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

107
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:57,330
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

108
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,059
â™«  Luckily, you didn't go far away  â™«

109
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,619
Shuyi, you just left one question unanswered.

110
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:09,301
I haven't got the answer yet.

111
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:13,701
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

112
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,808
Youâ€¦ can take your time.

113
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:19,259
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

114
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,019
I'll go back and give you an outline.

115
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,799
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

116
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,220
I have an interview with Zhanlan tomorrow. I'll go back first.

117
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,020
Good night.

118
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,610
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

119
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,879
Good night!

120
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,359
The young, talented and handsome Professor Yu.

121
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,240
Your takeout.

122
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,656
 This way, we're actually eating together. Right? 

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,639
 Thank you. 

124
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,279
 If you really want to thank me can you fulfill a request? 

125
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,240
 Send me pictures of your meals, too. 

126
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,559
Professor Yu, your girlfriend ordered this for you?

127
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,639
No, no, no.

128
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,300
We'll be off then. Bye.

129
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,600
He had some from the Xu's.

130
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,120
He didn't touch the spicy dishes.

131
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,800
He ate all Yubao Pavilion's food.

132
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,239
 You don't like spicy food. I'll be careful next time. 

133
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,039
 You like Yubao Pavilion's food. 

134
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,679
 Next time, let's go there together 

135
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,533
Yubao Pavilion?

136
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:18,799
   

137
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,840
I don't really have high standards for food.

138
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Who I eat with is more important to me.

139
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,919
 You must have paid a fortune to get those limited-edition albums of Song Lelan. 

140
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,479
But sometimes money can't solve everything.

141
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:41,399
I measure something by whether it should be done and if it's worth it.

142
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,140
 When I'm with someone I like even if it's just eating street food, I'm happy. 

143
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,699
 With that person, even listening to songs on the cell phone can be pleasant. 

144
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:51,440
I hope you will find someone who appreciates your taste.

145
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,300
 You two can go to Yubao Pavilion together 

146
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,440
 and collect Song Lelan's albums together. 

147
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,960
Qin Shiyue, you can't give up so easily.

148
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,120
He ate your food and thanked you.

149
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,799
He just doesn't like you squandering money.

150
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,840
Now that you know it avoid wasting money next time.

151
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:46,950
   

152
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,050
   

153
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,399
 You sent it to the wrong person? 

154
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,840
 No? 

155
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,279
 No. 

156
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,386
 I'm saving you time for the outline. 

157
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,840
 Calm down. 

158
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,919
 It's not too late to write the outline after tomorrow's interview. 

159
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,600
What are you doing here?

160
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,159
You still remember my room's across the hall. Right?

161
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:49,320
Ms. Zheng, this is the coffee Mr. Shi ordered for you.

162
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,919
Get in.

163
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,380
Thank you Mr. Shi for sending me.

164
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,159
Thanks for the coffee.

165
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,440
Assistant Zheng, why are you here today?

166
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Hello. I'm Financial Introduce's reporter, Zheng Shuyi.

167
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,440
You'reâ€¦ Reporter Zheng?

168
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,559
Let me show youâ€¦

169
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,080
A tour of your factory?

170
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,979
You don't remember? I just visited yesterday.

171
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:53,300
Well, I'll take you up first.

172
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,079
This way, please.

173
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,859
Mr. Shi, where are we going now?

174
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,879
This way, please.

175
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,879
This way, please.

176
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,419
Ms. Zheng, wait here for a moment.

177
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,559
Let me inform Mr. Jiang.

178
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,140
Mr. Jiang, Ms. Zheng from Financial Introduce has arrived.

179
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,879
Tell her to wait.

180
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,879
- Ms. Zhengâ€¦ 
 - Mr. Jiang!

181
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,279
Why are you here?

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,639
My appointment with Mr. Jiang is at 10:00.

183
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,780
It's 10:15 now.

184
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,399
Mr. Jiang, she is Zheng Shuyi, Financial Introduce's reporter.

185
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,360
Reporter Zheng?

186
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,159
Then yesterdayâ€¦

187
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,020
Mr. Shi and I are good friends.

188
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,840
You're well-connected.

189
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,539
Not only do you know Mr. Guan but you're also good friends with Mr. Shi.

190
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,059
Our argument has led to friendship.

191
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,630
Since Mr. Shi is your friend,

192
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,290
we can still consider working with Cloud Innovation.

193
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,345
That's not necessary. Let's be professional.

194
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,059
Cloud Innovation is a professional company.

195
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,519
I won't be able to influence Mr. Shi.

196
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:23,880
Mr. Jiang, can we start now?

197
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,459
Sure.

198
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:29,120
When I just graduated, I participated in many companies' recruitment interviews.

199
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,939
They all thought I was an inexperienced college student.

200
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:33,579
That was normal.

201
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:38,379
I had no choice but to work in a small factory and sell batteries.

202
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:42,959
Then that path brought me here. That was quite unexpected.

203
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,679
I've read about your startup stories in Finance Perspective.

204
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,419
I'm sure readers would like to know about you and Zhanlan's present plans.

205
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,280
Yes, of course.

206
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,099
We built Zhanlan to make the best battery in China.

207
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:01,153
We want to export Chinese batteries and show them to the world.

208
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:05,540
And to this day, we've never been stagnant or complacent.

209
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,680
Because we have a responsibility and a mission.

210
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,179
Do you have any thoughts on the recent accident, Mr. Jiang?

211
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,590
With all due respect. With this problem unsolved,

212
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,830
it'll very difficult to realize your vision.

213
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,100
Ms. Zheng,

214
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,680
an automobile, on average, consists of around 10,000 individual, non-removable parts.

215
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,200
A Formula One car even has 20,000 parts.

216
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,699
So there are many reasons and possibilities for accidents.

217
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,920
The accident is not necessarily a direct result of the battery's problem.

218
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,440
And our cooperation with Hengxin has been steady.

219
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,580
Which also means it's not our problem.

220
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,900
Also, let's put aside all that first, Ms. Zheng, why are you being so aggressive?

221
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,180
Zhanlan has always had a good reputation and we've developed well.

222
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,499
Our collaboration with Financial Introduce won't be limited to this one article.

223
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:57,640
In fact, I'm sure that the people who read this magazine

224
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,499
don't really want to know about the accident reports.

225
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,400
Got it.

226
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,780
So for this part of the interview, I'll give all the facts in the accident report.

227
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,205
I believe this is your first time in Ancheng.

228
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:19,539
You know, Ancheng is famous for its Tianshan Tea.

229
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:25,459
The process of tea plucking and tea making has a history of more than a hundred years.

230
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:29,480
Later, I'll ask Ding to pack you some.

231
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,660
Let's see what other regional specialties we can get you.

232
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,599
Take them all back and enjoy.

233
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,300
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

234
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,400
But I'm not so much of a tea drinker so don't let me waste it.

235
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,480
Everyone in the industry knows that Zhanlan has been raising capital lately.

236
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
So, Mr. Jiang, what are you going to do with the money?

237
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,000
At any stage of a company's life it needs capital.

238
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,739
The money will be used for our development and technological reformation.

239
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:08,739
So is it for upscaling production or upgrading technology?

240
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:10,259
Let me be more blunt.

241
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:14,519
Will the money be used to expand the production line or to develop technology?

242
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,062
You're very well prepared.

243
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:24,264
You've certainly done ample research.

244
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:28,820
I'd still like you to put in a good word for Zhanlan when you write this piece.

245
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,675
After all, building a business is hard.

246
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:35,680
But sometimes all it takes to ruin it is a word or two.

247
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,119
The only thing that can make a company thrive is technology and quality products.

248
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,340
It's not just one or two words that can ruin a business.

249
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,480
If you think factual words can destroy Zhanlan then perhaps you should question yourself.

250
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,280
You're good. I'm impressed.

251
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,060
As a company grows there's always trouble of all kinds.

252
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,559
Since you and Mr. Shi are good friends

253
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,659
then I can work with Mr. Shi. Consider it a favor for you.

254
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,300
We'll work together to solve the issue he cares about and let's achieve win-win.

255
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,359
What do you think?

256
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,499
You've got a high opinion of me.

257
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm just a reporter. I can't influence you two's decisions.

258
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,560
Thank you for your valuable time.

259
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,619
But I think that Mr. Shi is deeply in love with you.

260
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,759
Ding told me all about it.

261
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,379
Mr. Shi sent you here. And he's still waiting downstairs.

262
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:33,880
Maybe you'll be able to return Mr. Shi's deep affections with a little help.

263
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,737
This article will be published in Financial Introduce's in-depth analysis column.

264
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:41,920
I would naturally state the advantages of Zhanlan.

265
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,241
But Zhanlan's problems are also the important content that I want to present to my readers.

266
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:51,259
The article you want should better be published on your company's official account.

267
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:55,599
As for Mr. Shi, I can buy him dinner as a thank you.

268
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:10,100
Ms. Zheng, please take it or I won't be able to answer to my boss.

269
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,560
Mr. Ding, it's really not necessary. I'm really not a tea-drinker.

270
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,820
You, take it back.

271
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,921
Please take it.

272
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:17,137
- You don't have toâ€¦ 
 - Ms. Zheng.

273
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,960
I'll be going now. Bye.

274
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,599
What a coincidence. You're here again.

275
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,599
I'll invite you to dinner today.

276
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,079
Get in the car.

277
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,199
Hello, Mom? 
-  Shuyi, have you eaten? 

278
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:47,499
 How are you doing with Yu You recently? 

279
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:49,880
 You should invite him to dinner more often. 

280
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,960
 In this day and age, a girl can be generous and take the initiative. 

281
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,559
I get it.

282
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,720
I'm at work. I'm hanging up.

283
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,060
Or you can invite me to dinner?

284
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:06,980
Thank you, then, for being generous and taking the initiative.

285
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,499
Is it too much for you to digest?

286
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,559
This lesson is relatively packed with knowledge.

287
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,319
I hope you'll review it when you get back.

288
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,860
Okay, that's call it a day.

289
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,039
 Thank you, Professor. 

290
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,859
Professor Yu, can we have lunch together?

291
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,620
Come with me to the office.

292
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,779
Your office?

293
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,280
Sure.

294
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,000
Mr. Yu.

295
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,899
Ms. Qin, please take them back.

296
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,400
That's why you called me here.

297
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,280
These are too expensive.

298
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,100
I can easily gain access to these songs using my phone.

299
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,119
You'd better keep them for yourself.

300
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,701
I saw you at Song Lelan's concert.

301
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:02,459
I was guessing that you were a fan.

302
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:05,379
So I thought I'd give you these.

303
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:07,720
These really don't cost anything.

304
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,580
It's very kind of you.

305
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,880
We use our hearts to appreciate music. The fancy form is irrelevant.

306
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,500
If the form steals the spotlight of the music then it's not worth it and it's not necessary.

307
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,079
So if you're just doing this to please me then please take them back.

308
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,060
Okay.

309
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,839
I'll take them home and keep them for you.

310
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,599
You'll see later that these cost nothing and it's not about the fancy form.

311
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,619
It's just a small gesture of kindness.

312
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,359
So, can we go eat now?

313
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,360
Ms. Qin, I understand your feelings.

314
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,768
You never officially confessed. I'm not very good at dealing with that either.

315
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:53,599
But I think I should respond to you clearly today.

316
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,701
I'm grateful for the favor you've shown me.

317
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:00,154
You're still young.

318
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:05,397
I'm afraid your feelings for me now are just a passing fancy, and won't last.

319
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:08,269
Because we're not right for each other. We don't know each other.

320
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:13,480
You're afraid that I won't like you one day, that our love won't last?

321
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,580
We're really not right for each other.

322
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,920
I'm young. But I'm not naive.

323
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,219
I have my own judgment and pursuit in a relationship. It's not just a whim.

324
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,240
You didn't say you don't have feelings for me.

325
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,419
Your concern is that we don't know each other well enough.

326
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,640
Well, we can get to know each other slowly.

327
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,299
As for longevity.

328
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,259
You're always free to break up with me. Right?

329
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,659
But I think one can't start a relationship by thinking about the outcome first.

330
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:54,939
All you have to do now is give me a chance to pursue you and get to know you.

331
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:07,926
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

332
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:13,759
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

333
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,300
I have to take this call. You go home first.

334
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:21,741
Then I'll start getting to know you better.

335
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,759
Maybe we shouldn't limit our options to Zhanlan.

336
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,819
Have you seen him lately? What's he up to?

337
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,260
It's been a long time.

338
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,279
She's probably busy.

339
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,139
Or maybeâ€¦ she doesn't want to see me.

340
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,080
I'm sorry. I just finished the course.

341
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,120
What are you guys talking about?

342
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,619
Guan Ji said he hasn't seen you for a long time.

343
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,359
We just had dinner last night.

344
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,160
He's been coming to me almost every night this week.

345
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,919
Well, that shows how much I miss you!

346
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,980
This is good coffee.

347
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,399
So it's just like we thought.

348
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:51,200
When Zhanlan gets the money, they're going to use it to expand production.

349
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,419
In the automotive industry, the demand for batteries is constantly evolving.

350
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,559
Once another battery company makes a technological breakthrough

351
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,240
then the Zhanlan's partners will reconsider their collaboration.

352
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,119
- When that happensâ€¦ 
 - We can't wait for that long.

353
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,620
But if we decide not to work with Zhanlan,

354
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,259
we'll have to figure out a way to convince the old men.

355
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:13,499
They will still wish to invest in Zhanlan

356
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,860
but will want to minimize risk by shortening the duration of the partnership.

357
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,359
Maybe they don't need convincing.

358
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,640
We just need to find a better investment target for them.

359
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,559
That sounds harder than convincing them.

360
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:28,260
I'm almost done with the report. I'll send it to you in a couple of days.

361
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,820
What report?

362
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,259
Let's go. Let's eat.

363
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,619
Huh?

364
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:41,159
- Give it to me earlier. 
 - What report?

365
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,699
Yu You, why don't you tell me about it?

366
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:10,930
â™«  Not accidentally  â™«

367
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,720
â™«  It's not just a coincidence  â™«

368
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,540
   

369
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,736
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

370
00:28:28,736 --> 00:28:33,517
    
 â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

371
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:43,230
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

372
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,565
â™«  If love is like a cloud  â™«

373
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:51,721
â™«  Always erratic  â™«

374
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:56,408
    
 â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

375
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:59,440
    
 â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

376
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,879
   

377
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:02,939
â™«  I will also be cautious  â™«

378
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,060
Why would I cancel?

379
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,156
Zheng Shuyi, what are you thinking?

380
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:14,810
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

381
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,899
 Pathways never swept for a visitor's sake 

382
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:23,014
â™«  Are deserted and sweet  â™«

383
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:26,015
â™«  I can't grasp it, so I take a deep breath  â™«

384
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:30,125
Pathways never swept for a visitor's sake.

385
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:34,680
My humble gate only opens for you.

386
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,711
â™«  No need to ask, I am willing  â™«

387
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,300
This is a pretty good piece.

388
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,020
So good that the lead editor just now called me for half an hour.

389
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:06,139
Do you have any idea what will happen if it's published?

390
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,258
Yes, I do.

391
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:10,807
But I must publish it.

392
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:16,066
When I started out, you told me to stay true to the facts and make a good point,

393
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,079
that we should be responsible for the readers, industry, and society.

394
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,079
I think this piece does it all.

395
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,020
You're refuting me with my own words, aren't you?

396
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,820
Since you're determined, do it.

397
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,240
Sister Yi, don't you blame me?

398
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,940
What? You think you're the only one with a work ethic and that I am not?

399
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,119
Don't forget who told you those things.

400
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,580
I'll send it to them for layout.

401
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,359
Hello, Guan.

402
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,319
 Have you left yet? Do you want me to pick you up? 

403
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,700
No, I drove today.

404
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,519
Next time.

405
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:15,694
   

406
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,519
- Done. 
 - Thank you.

407
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,119
- Hello. 
 - Hello. How can I help you?

408
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,219
Hello, I'm Zheng Shuyi, a reporter for Financial Introduce.

409
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:25,820
I have an appointment with Director Qiu of your finance department.

410
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,720
Please wait a moment.

411
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,010
   

412
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,039
 Lezhi, Financial Introduce's reporter has an appointment with Director Qiu. 

413
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,659
 - She's already here.  
 - What's her name?

414
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:42,640
 Her name is Zheng Shuyi. 

415
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:45,259
Okay, I got it.

416
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,759
Director Qiu is in a meeting now.

417
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,799
Let her wait in the waiting area.

418
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,440
 Yes, Lezhi. 

419
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,140
Ms. Zheng, wait here, please.

420
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,759
Director Qiu is in a meeting. Someone will take you to him later.

421
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,319
Thank you.

422
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,360
Excuse me. Has Director Qiu finished his meeting?

423
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,739
Let me check for you.

424
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:05,319
Thank you.

425
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,199
Ms. Zheng.

426
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:18,260
It's really you. What are you doing here?

427
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,219
I have an appointment with Director Qiu. He's in a meeting.

428
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:24,219
   

429
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:28,060
Well, I'll get back to work.

430
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,459
How long has she been waiting?

431
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:41,107
I see she's already had several cups of coffee.

432
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:43,640
When I came up, I went and asked about it.

433
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,619
Director Qiu doesn't have a meeting this afternoon.

434
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,870
- Got it. 
 - Mr Shi.

435
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,480
Go.

436
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
Okay.

437
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,319
Are you Ms. Zheng?

438
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:10,280
Director Qiu, nice to meet you.

439
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,101
I'm Financial Introduce's reporter Zheng Shuyi.

440
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:14,140
Nice to meet you. I'm sorry.

441
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,280
My secretary made a mistake. Sorry for keeping you waiting.

442
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,599
No worries.

443
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,419
Well, please come to my office.

444
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,980
Sure.

445
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,920
 Cloud Innovation employees, especially managers, should be punctual. 

446
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,660
I understand.

447
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,920
Financial Introduce's interviews aim to enable the public to know us better.

448
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,599
Don't let the press know that you need me to remind you of this trivial matter.

449
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,800
We've prepared everything. Mr. Shiâ€¦

450
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,110
I mean, everything you requested.

451
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,540
Thank you so much. I'm sorry for the trouble.

452
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,400
No problem.

453
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,419
 Qin Lezhi? 

454
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,660
 So, Shi Yan put her in the Finance Department. 

455
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,144
This way.

456
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,944
   

457
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,920
Over here.

458
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:07,299
Why would Qiu Fu pick her up in person?

459
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:08,900
Here you are.

460
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,760
Thank you, Director Qiu. Thank you.

461
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,960
Next time, you come and call me directly and I'll arrange it.

462
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,307
I will specially wait here for you.

463
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:16,440
That's so nice of you. I'll go first.

464
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,607
- Okay. 
 - See you. Bye.

465
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,083
Mr. Shi, Ms. Zheng is gone.

466
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,560
Come to my office.

467
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:49,059
Director Qiu, you wanted to see me?

468
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:52,320
I had an appointment with the reporter from Financial Introduce at 3:00 p.m.

469
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,380
How come you moved up my meeting with the bank?

470
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,820
She waited so long but you didn't tell me.

471
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,119
Qin, you've been working for me for a long time.

472
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,880
Aren't you always so careful with your work?

473
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,960
How could such a mistake happen?

474
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,719
I think the banks are more important.

475
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,780
I thought Financial Introduce wasn't a top priority.

476
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,840
That's why I adjusted your schedule.

477
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,339
You thoughtâ€¦ What do you think?

478
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,360
Can't you figure out your place first?

479
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,960
You changed my schedule without knowing who's really important!

480
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,780
I remember you saying that banks are important clients

481
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,139
and that journalists should wait for you.

482
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:37,019
PR will prepare the information if the press is really in a hurry.

483
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:39,759
- So Iâ€¦ 
 - So why don't you do my job for me?

484
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:41,860
Is Zheng Shuyi a regular reporter?

485
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,320
Do you know who she is?

486
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,860
Is it as simple as you think?

487
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,780
I'm sorry, Director. It's my fault this time.

488
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,079
There won't be a next time.

489
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,360
Next time, you don't have to come see me.

490
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,159
Get out.

491
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,879
Zheng Shuyi.

492
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,919
It's you again.

493
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:18,539
Qiu Fu says she's no ordinary journalist.

494
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:21,079
No ordinary journalistâ€¦

495
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,800
Then who is she?

496
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:51,640
Ms. Zheng are you waiting for the next elevator?

497
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,020
 What's he doing here? 

498
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,639
 I forgot to press the floor. 

499
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,299
Hello, Mr. Shi.

500
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,440
Hello, Mr. Shi.

501
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,080
What's going on? Who's this girl?

502
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,559
 He pulled me over and doesn't say a word. 

503
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,559
 Playing cool, huh? 

504
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,480
 Shi Yan, you're really good at this. 

505
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:23,380
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

506
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,820
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

507
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,599
No problem.

508
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:36,114
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

509

â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

511
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:49,012
 Look how careful she is unlike someone who's rude to his guest.

520
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,239
Mr. Chen.

521
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,220
Ms. Zheng, do you need anything?

522
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,000
I want to get Mr. Shi a cup of warm lemonade with a little honey.

523
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,142
Mr. Shi doesn't drink honey and we don't have it here in the company.

524
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:54,059
Huh? How come?

525
00:40:54,059 --> 00:41:00,040
Mr. Shi knew you drank lots of coffee down there so he prepared the drink for you.

526
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,095
He knew I was down there?

527
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:06,560
Yes, he knew you waited for a long time and specially called Mr. Qiu.

528
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,119
â€‹â™«  I can no longer erase your traces from my heart  â™«

529
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,039
Thank you.

530
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,120
No problem. I just told Mr. Shi the truth.

531
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,599
Would you please get me a glass of warm lemonade?

532
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,419
Sure, wait a second.

533
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:25,235
â™«  But I'm afraid it's too late  â™«

534
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:30,170

â™«  The courage to transcend time  â™«

539
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:53,840
â™«  I'll let you know that I'm still where I am  â™«

540
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,340
I got it on you. I'm sorry.

541
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,079
Don't worry.

542
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,440
You're done with work?

543
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,419
Not yet.

544
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,259
Then what were you going to do?

545
00:42:08,688 --> 00:42:12,408
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

550
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,230
Suddenly I want a cup of coffee.

551
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,500
Don't drink coffee. Drink something warm.

552
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,560
Sure.

553
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:42,387
 â™« I want to let you know I remember â™« 

554
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,939
Wait for a bit.

555
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,480
Okay.
