 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:32,181
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:34,606
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:38,781
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:41,181
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:45,806
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:48,206
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,392
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:53,931
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,006
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,281
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:02,606
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:06,531
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:09,466
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:13,026
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:16,281
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:20,231
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:25,356
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:35,906
   

21
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:38,950
   

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,020
 He and I were pretty close in college. 

23
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,100
 Soâ€¦  
 - It's okay. You can invite him.

24
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,398
I'm all good with that.

25
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,820
What's the big deal? It's between us. It shouldn't affect you.

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,120
 Yeah, I know. I called him this morning. 

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,884
 But I think his current girlfriend is also coming to the wedding. 

28
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,660
 So I'm asking you. 

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,980
It's okay. I don't care.

30
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,580
 That's fine. Let's keep in contact. 

31
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,200
Sure.

32
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,800
 If I go to the wedding alone that day, 

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,000
 and Yue Xingzhou shows up with Qin Lezhi acting all lovey-dovey, 

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,700
 I'd probably die of anger. 

35
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,060
 But Shi Yanâ€¦ 

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,560
That's the end of today's program.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,919
Thank you all for being here.

38
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,500
   

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,279
Qin Shiyue.

40
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,060
Yu You!

41
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,719
You're taking notes?

42
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,520
Sister Shuyi told me to go back and write a summary.

43
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,080
But there's so much I don't understand.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,639
Actually,

45
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,599
Iâ€¦

46
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,199
What is it?

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,420
I don't think you need to get hung up on technical terms and concepts.

48
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,240
You're writing finance articles.

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,459
You should grasp trends and developments in the chip industry.

50
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,780
You can mark terms that are frequently mentioned and look them up later.

51
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,720
Yu You, you're great.

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,010
I get it when you say it like that.

53
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,460
Guan Ji isn't with you?

54
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,300
He had to leave.

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,859
I don't know what he's up to these days.

56
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,759
I'll leave now if there is nothing else.

57
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,460
   

58
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,180
What's that? It's a 40-minute wait.

59
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,639
Qin Shiyue.

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,199
You're not leaving?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,860
I'm leaving! Wait for me.

62
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,220
   

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,790
   

64
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,979
Is he asleep at this hour?

65
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,160
 You're up? 

66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,759
 I just woke up. 

67
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,199
 So? 

68
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,380
 I can't sleep anymore. 

69
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,759
 And? 

70
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
 Is there anything you'd like me to do? 

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,580
 For instance, you can have Qiu send me more materials and stuff. 

72
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,860
 You want to bother him at this late hour? 

73
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,900
 Okay, I got it. Bye. 

74
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,319
 Get changed. 

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,859
 Let's go out. 

76
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,639
 Where are we going? 

77
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,460
 Let's go to a movie. 

78
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,430
   

79
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:42,451
   

80
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,839
 You're going to the movie with your friend at this time of night? 

81
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,000
 She knows how to make me feel embarrassed. 

82
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,020
 Many of my friends never go to the movies with me late at night. 

83
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,899
 I'm so envious. Your friends are really nice to you. 

84
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,073
 Haha. 

85
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:10,040
   

86
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,000
 He even gave me a like? 

87
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,240
Uncle?

88
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,660
Am I seeing things?

89
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,100
I can't believe my uncle gave her a like.

90
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,360
Uncle has collaborated with Sister Shuyi before.

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,219
It's not strange that they are WeChat friends.

92
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,659
But it's still a bit off.

93
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:45,220
It's not like him to leave a like in another person's post late at night.

94
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,920
Uncle isn't in love with Sister Shuyi, is he?

95
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,580
Forget about it. I don't want to get murdered for knowing too much.

96
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,540
I should learn from the mistakes of the past.

97
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:13,720
Sister Shuyi is not watching the movie with Yu You, is she?

98
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,820
Instead of guessing, I should just go find the truth.

99
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,499
What if she's not with Yu You?

100
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:45,279
Then I knocked on his door at this hour.

101
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,639
He'll hate me, won't he?

102
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,260
Hello?

103
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,259
 Hello, this is the front desk. 

104
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,800
What can I do for you?

105
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,879
 We've seen a figure outside your door on the security camera. 

106
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,200
 We'd like to remind you to lock your door before you go to bed. 

107
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,819
 In case of emergency, please contact us or the police. 

108
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:19,019
Okay. Thank you.

109
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,919
Qin Shiyue?

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,985
The front desk called me saying that someone was acting suspiciously at my door.

111
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:04,619
I was wondering who it was.

112
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:05,960
I didn't realize it was you.

113
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,840
Why did you hang around my place instead of staying in your room at night?

114
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,000
I have something to do. Don't worry about me.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,779
I don't worry at all.

116
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,879
Go back to your room and don't cause trouble.

117
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,220
Who's causing trouble?

118
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,610
Well, look at you!

119
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,410
Where are you going in the middle of the night dressed like this?

120
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,120
I have something to do, too. Don't worry about me.

121
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,279
You walked around in front of the door.

122
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,840
I don't know if the front desk called Yu You.

123
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,699
I don't even know if he's in his room.

124
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,240
Go back to your room. I'm leaving.

125
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,420
Go back quickly.

126
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,879
Yu You, are you watching the movie with Sister Shuyi?

127
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,299
Who is it?

128
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,879
 It's me. 

129
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,819
What are you doing here?

130
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,600
Let's talk.

131
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,000
 Let's go. 

132
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,380
 What kind of movie is this? 

133
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,840
 Isn't he bored? 

134
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,519
 You cheated on me and you want me to pretend that all the pain doesn't exist. 

135
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,919
 And then you want me to stay with you. 

136
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,279
 It's impossible. 

137
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,480
 Shi Hai! 

138
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,780
 Is this how Shi Yan will react when he finds out about the truth? 

139
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,840
I think you've been avoiding me lately.

140
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,440
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

141
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,100
You see?

142
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,300
Now, for example.

143
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,199
You're still avoiding my eyes.

144
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,600
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

145
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,200
I didn't realize you cared about the details.

146
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,051
It's not the details I care about.

147
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,900
I care about you.

148
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,800
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

149
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:53,618
â™«  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  â™«

150
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:57,520
You've got a way with words, don't you?

151
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,024
I have to learn how to do that.

152
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:06,740
It's not sweet talk. It's not a game, Shanshan.

153
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,482
â™«  I predicted the rain, but I pretend not to care  â™«

154
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:13,365
â€‹â™«  Lost in the night  â™«

155
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:16,897
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

156
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:22,002
â™«  The courage to transcend time  â™«

157
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,630
â™«  Even if I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

158
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,940
You may not believe what I'm about to say,

159
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,779
but I mean every word of it.

160
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:38,360
I've always lacked the experience in maintaining a long-term, stable relationship.

161
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,720
I don't have the confidence either.

162
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,939
So, when I had feelings for you, I couldn't promise anything more.

163
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:48,960
But when I see you avoiding me,

164
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,099
I feel that I really care about you. And I've been thinking seriously about our relationship.

165
00:13:57,099 --> 00:14:01,659
Of course. It'll take some time.

166
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,340
But no matter what, please don't run away from me anymore. Okay?

167
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:18,996
â€‹â™«  I can no longer erase your traces from my heart  â™«

168
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,553
I know.

169
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,861
I won't avoid you anymore.

170
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:31,364
But as for the rest, I need time to think about it.

171
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:34,840
â™«  Even if I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

172
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,734
Let's think about it together.

173
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,960
Did you like it?

174
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,519
What?

175
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,079
Just, today's movie?

176
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,720
It was okay.

177
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,680
What did you think?

178
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,600
Me? I thought it was okay.

179
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,019
I think it was pretty good.

180
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,440
The way the heroine leaned on the hero's arms at the end was so beautiful.

181
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,419
And the two actors looked really good together.

182
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:18,399
It was so sweet. And my heart was filled with love.

183
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,159
That scene was the imagination of the hero.

184
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,200
The heroine died.

185
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,840
The hero committed suicide.

186
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,179
Yes, that's right.

187
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,480
But it's also kind of beautiful, isn't it?

188
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,260
They clear up their misunderstandings and love each other till the end of the line.

189
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,220
Isn't that love?

190
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,499
Are we really talking about the same movie?

191
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,700
 Why are the hero and heroine dead? 

192
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,840
 Isn't this a sweet romance movie? 

193
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,499
 Shouldn't the story be about mutual redemption? 

194
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:57,940
 That's why the audience was all gone. 

195
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,600
 It's a fraud. 

196
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,810
   

197
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,740
Shuyi!

198
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,620
You two?

199
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,759
I met Mr. Guan by chance.

200
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,040
Mr. Shi and I also met by chance.

201
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,820
What a coincidence that the four of us ran into each other again.

202
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,979
There's only one elevator hall in this hotel, so we're bound to run into each other.

203
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,319
That's right.

204
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,400
That's also a coincidence.

205
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,559
I met Ms. Bi on my way back from a midnight snack.

206
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,640
You're dressed like this for a midnight snack?

207
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,740
That's right.

208
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,659
I was going to call you, but I didn't realize you were out alone in the middle of the night.

209
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,359
- Iâ€¦ 
 - I get it. I totally get it.

210
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,160
It's late. Let's go up.

211
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,090
 Oh no! He's got that horrible look again. 

212
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,640
 Shi Yan isn't angry, is he? 

213
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:16,259
Qin Shiyue, Qin Shiyue.

214
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:20,179
You have to be brave and decisive.

215
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,659
   

216
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,280
 There's a new movie out. Want to go see it? 

217
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,845
   

218
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,230
There are some debates about the movie.

219
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,260
Let's discuss it in person after watching it.

220
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,100
I've finished organizing the minutes of today's meeting.

221
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,930
After the meeting, we need to relax

222
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,750
so that we can receive new information tomorrow.

223
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:21,780
Two people from completely different worlds are brought together by accident.

224
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,850
A 24-hour-long window for love

225
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,430
it's short but eternal.

226
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,680
 It's a bit romantic. 

227
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,619
I've been given plenty of information.

228
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:45,260
A man as artistic as Yu You wouldn't be able to reject.

229
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:49,370
 It's a tight schedule tomorrow. 

230
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,500
 Get some rest. Good night. 

231
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:10,330
 Mr. Shi and I met by chance. 

232
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,260
 What a coincidence that the four of us ran into each other again. 

233
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,620
 Zheng Shuyi, 

234
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,899
 uou don't want people to know about our relationship? 

235
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,799
The movie had the happy ending I told him about.

236
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,440
What's wrong with Shi Yan?

237
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,219
Did he even watch the movie properly?

238
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,300
 Why did you lie to me? 

239
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,979
 What did I lie to you about? 

240
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,060
 The movie didn't end that way. 

241
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,459
 Then why did you get distracted in the theater? 

242
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,500
 Because I was looking at you. 

243
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,640
 I couldn't focus my mind on the movie when you were around. 

244
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:02,839
None of your business.

245
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,119
 There's a summit on nano-chip technology tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. 

246
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:14,100
 We'll go there together. 

247
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:21,939
 You were right today. 

248
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:24,379
 I should be focusing on industry trends.] 

249
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:26,699
 So I'm going go to the corporate showroom. 

250
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,939
 Maybe I'll meet my next opportunity. 

251
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,839
Shi Yan shouldn't be offended when my logic is sound. Right?

252
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,899
I meanâ€¦ the opportunity for interviews.

253
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,939
Opportunities for articles and nothing else.

254
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,799
Your work depends on hard work not just opportunities.

255
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,799
He's really jealous after all.

256
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,659
But I like it when you're jealous.

257
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,799
 I like to see someone get jealous over me. That's the real me. 

258
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:17,827
   

259
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:25,620
   

260
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,340
Hold this for me. Thank you.

261
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,279
Chenxing's materials are heat-resistant and stable.

262
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,559
This company offers many solutions to the problems caused by size reduction.

263
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,920
For example, contact resistance migration degradation and reduced reliability.

264
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,640
Mr. Yi, what a coincidence!

265
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,300
It's not a coincidence. I saw you over there and came to see you.

266
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,319
Are you feeling better?

267
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,060
Thank you. I'm fine.

268
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,379
You missed a forum yesterday. I can tell you about it.

269
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,659
 This is from yesterday's forum. 

270
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,360
 Thanks. Kiss. 

271
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,519
Thanks to you, but my friend has organized it for me.

272
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,139
Shi Yan is one step ahead of me.

273
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,700
Let's go to the forum later.

274
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,640
Some of the technical stuff is too much for me.

275
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,599
I'll stay in the exhibit hall and gather some information.

276
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:49,680
I can help you with anything you don't understand.

277
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,920
I know a bit about Chenxing, too.

278
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
We can discuss it together.

279
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,470
Many nano chip experts will talk about

280
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,550
the trend of technology development later.

281
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,479
And some industry pioneers will discuss whether the 2027 time frame can be advanced.

282
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,839
You'll have more information to work with.

283
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,260
You'll know who to turn to if you need advice.

284
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,619
Most importantly, I've been invited to speak later.

285
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,500
It's about to start. It's a good time for us to walk over.

286
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,480
Mr. Yi is really a young talent. He also has a great sense of humor.

287
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,775
We're honored to have several technical experts in the industry to share their insights.

288
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,170
We have also invited Cloud Innovation's founder.

289
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,880
Mr. Shi Yan is very optimistic about chips.

290
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,500
He will talk to us about related topics.

291
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,440
Welcome, Mr. Shi.

292
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:06,937
   

293
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,240
Hello, everyone.

294
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,000
Today, those present are technical experts and dark horses in the industry.

295
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
As for meâ€¦

296
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,859
Actually, I'm a food provider.

297
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,559
Everyone here today is a familiar face.

298
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,740
Bruce is the former head of Le'an's R&amp;D department.

299
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,119
He's now the CTO of Black Horse Technology.

300
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:33,719
I wonder what Mr. Yi and Mr. Shi think about Le'an and Dark Horse's competition.

301
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,219
What do we think about it? Isn't it obvious enough?

302
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:48,419
Mr. Shi and I see eye to eye.

303
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,740
Both companies are dedicated to the development of domestic chips.

304
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,920
Even if there's a rivalry, it's a gentlemen's rivalry.

305
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,759
Bruce chose Le'an Tech and then Dark Horse.

306
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,960
This proves the strength of both companies.

307
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,000
Le'an's technology and patriotism resonate with Cloud Innovation's vision.

308
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,880
That's why Cloud Innovation is honored to work with Le'an Tech.

309
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,319
Any technological development is a marathon.

310
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,839
It doesn't matter if you're running ahead or behind for the time being.

311
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,440
The important thing is to stick to the original intention and go to the end.

312
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,735
What if Dark Horse is the first to make a technological breakthrough?

313
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:35,260
   

314
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,859
The development of millimeter-wave chips is not only for the benefit of enterprises.

315
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:43,799
It's also about the development of society and people's livelihood.

316
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:48,519
So, whether the final leader is Le'an Tech or Dark Horse,

317
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,640
it's all in the interest of consumers.

318
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,680
If Black Horse Technology really makes a breakthrough,

319
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,980
Cloud Innovation will be happy to see it.

320
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,740
But Cloud Innovation still has confidence in Le'an Tech.

321
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,740
I also have confidence in the future of domestic chips.

322
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,379
Thank you.

323
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,380
   

324
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,400
Yu You.

325
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,559
I'm sorry.

326
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:44,679
Are you okay?

327
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,820
Yeah, I'm good.

328
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,980
Do you have plans later?

329
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,820
Not yet.

330
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,500
Why don't we go to lunch?

331
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,480
It's a working lunch.

332
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,400
It won't keep us from working.

333
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:03,040
Good. I'm hungry, too.

334
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,079
Let's go now.

335
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:15,583
   

336
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,260
You're done?

337
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,060
What are you looking at?

338
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm reviewing your speech.

339
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,120
You looked great today.

340
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I didn't before?

341
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,319
So you care so much about what the media says about you?

342
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,879
Let's go. Let's eat.

343
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:47,580
Zheng Shuyi.

344
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:55,619
Mr. Shi, you know Shuyi well?

345
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,960
Yes, I do.

346
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,979
- Mr. Shi is myâ€¦ 
 - Your boyfriend.

347
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,400
Then I should tell Mr. Shi that I'm pursuing Shuyi.

348
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,279
Yi Yang, stop it.

349
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,319
Do you think I'm joking?

350
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,859
Shuyi, I'm serious.

351
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,379
Let's have a gentlemen's rivalry.

352
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:41,920
Whether it's work or love, I'll win beautifully.

353
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,680
You're really young and confident.

354
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,880
Because of Dark Horse, Le'an Tech is now united as one.

355
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,880
No matter how this competition turns out, I've already won.

356
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:10,079
As for Shuyi, she can't be a bargaining chip in our competition.

357
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,880
I'll only have her as my girlfriend.

358
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,960
She has the right to choose who she likes.

359
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:23,200
Let's go eat.

360
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,139
This seems to be getting more and more interesting.

361
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,100
Thank you.

362
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,059
We're finally having a meal together.

363
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:45,519
Why did you insist on inviting me to a meal?

364
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,139
Isn't it obvious?

365
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,419
You've helped me so many times.

366
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,340
What's more.

367
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,079
Don't you think that by eating together, we can get closer quickly?

368
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
I see you as my student, more or less.

369
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm sure I'll help you with anything you need.

370
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,999
So don't worry about it.

371
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:21,040
But... I want to have this meal with you not as your student.

372
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,559
So, can I take you to dinner next time?

373
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,080
No, you can't.

374
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:40,219
Okay, then.

375
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,080
Next time, you should take me to dinner.

376
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:05,000
What's wrong?

377
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Nothing. I'm happy.

378
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,339
I understand. Then what?

379
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:15,260
And then there's no more.

380
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,680
Can Chen Kang really save Le'an Tech?

381
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,820
Le'an Tech will probably lose.

382
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,099
- Then you and Cloud Innovationâ€¦ 
 - Cloud Innovation and I are likely to fail as well.

383
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,200
If we lose, we'll just have to start all over again.

384
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,839
I've been through a time when I was surrounded by rumors.

385
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,039
At that time, I didn't dare to lose and couldn't afford to lose.

386
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:48,980
But now...

387
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,039
I can afford to lose.

388
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,200
Even if I lose, I can get back up.

389
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,859
Now you have me. I'll always be with you.

390
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:09,699
Success or failure, I'll face it with you.

391
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:16,839
Although I'm not rich, I can live a normal life with you.

392
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,519
Don't worry.

393
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,319
I won't lose your favorite car.

394
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,799
My dad gave it to me as a start-up gift.

395
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,959
I treasure it.

396
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,780
Are you going back?

397
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,780
I'm almost done with the interview.

398
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,400
Why didn't you tell me?

399
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,680
Why? I still have to report to you about my work?

400
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,580
Shanshan, are you leaving?

401
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,019
Yes.

402
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,280
Guan Ji.

403
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,980
Let's go.

404
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,460
What are you doing?

405
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,480
 When's your agency's vacation? 

406
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,599
 Let's see if we can go back together. 

407
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,019
Let me check our arrangement first.

408
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,459
Bye.

409
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,239
Do you have any plans for the Spring Festival?

410
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,879
The 28th day of the 12th lunar month.

411
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:01,159
Shanshan asked me when the magazine was on vacation.

412
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,199
She wants to ask me to go home with her.

413
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,719
 We just got together and we're going to be apart for a long time. 

414
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,259
I'll keep myself available that day and send you home.

415
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,300
I have a lot of things to take with me.

416
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,219
I can fit your stuff in my car.

417
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:32,760
Yes, no problem, Ms. Zheng. I'm sure of it.

418
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,800
The report is very clear.

419
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,840
Zhanlan is much bigger.

420
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:49,079
Juhe is just a fledgling R&amp;D team.

421
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,179
Choosing Juhe over Zhanlan is a small loss for a big gain.

422
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,599
Hasn't Zhanlan come a long way from its beginnings to its current size?

423
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,679
The battery industry relies heavily on technology.

424
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,119
Therefore, the strength of the R&amp;D team is very important.

425
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,260
Juhe has a top-notch R&amp;D team.

426
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,659
You should read the eleventh page of the report.

427
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,079
Juhe's R&amp;D expenses have exceeded 20% of its total revenue.

428
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,059
This alone shows Juhe's commitment to technological innovation.

429
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,400
I don't think so.

430
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,840
In my opinion, different companies have different strategies.

431
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,599
But it's also true that there's a huge difference in size between the two companies.

432
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,920
Zhanlan only spends 5% of its revenue on R&amp;D.

433
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,906
But it's still more than Juhe's 20%.

434
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:44,610
So I think it's a bit skewed

435
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,870
based on R&amp;D expenses alone.

436
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,679
You have a point.

437
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,560
Howeverâ€¦ Zhanlan's R&amp;D is slow.

438
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,639
Zhanlan is way behind Juhe and even way behind other teams.

439
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,360
How long can Zhanlan keep relying on its past success?

440
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,559
And it's not just a question of Zhanlan relying on its past success.

441
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,559
It's a matter of trade-offs.

442
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,880
Juhe is the part that we should keep.

443
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,199
Chen Sheng.

444
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,360
How many times do you have to recharge on your drive home?

445
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,880
Three times.

446
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,199
These three times of charging are the space left for Juhe.

447
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,000
They're also my opportunity.

448
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,920
Juhe is young and energetic. The key is that their valuation is good.

449
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,260
If you make the right bet we'll make a fortune.

450
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,960
It's almost the Spring Festival.

451
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,519
Yes, Mr. Shi.

452
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,719
Go buy some new-year gifts for Chen Kang and Le'an Tech.

453
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,380
Yes, sir.

454
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,679
Buy some other gifts that are suitable for families.

455
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,119
Yes, sir.

456
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,919
I've read the summary of the chip conference. It's good.

457
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,220
I'll pick a few points you can follow up on.

458
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,100
Before the holidays, write another report on Juhe as soon as possible.

459
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,119
We're as busy as before deadlines during the run-up to the Spring Festival.

460
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,739
If you're willing to give me the report over spring break, that's not a problem.

461
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,920
No, I'm not willing.

462
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
I'll give it to you before then, Sister Shuyi.

463
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,579
Shuyi, we're having a meeting.

464
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,239
Thank you.

465
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,079
How long has she been like this?

466
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,559
Very long. Long enough for Sister Shuyi to get used to it.

467
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,380
The fox will show its tail.

468
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,559
It won't last long.

469
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,060
 Let's have dinner tonight. 

470
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,420
 The fox will show its tail. 

471
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,100
Sister Shuyi, I'm off now.

472
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,559
Bye-bye.

473
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,679
You're not off yet?

474
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,619
Don't work too hard before the holidays.

475
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:05,439
I just need to finish what I'm doing. You go ahead.

476
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,719
My car's here, so I'm off. See you tomorrow.

477
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,239
Bye-bye.

478
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:28,023
   

479
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,119
 I'm in a meeting. 

480
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,220
 Some other time. I'm working late today. 

481
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,710
 I don't know when I can clock out. 

482
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,239
Mr. Shi.

483
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,080
Wait a little longer.

484
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:18,559
 Hey, dear. Are you off yet? 

485
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,580
No, I'm not.

486
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,699
Why do you sound so upset?

487
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:24,800
Nothing. I'm working late.

488
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,880
You work too hard.

489
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,519
Did you get your stuff for the Spring Festival?

490
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,599
No, I didn't.

491
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,299
 I knew it. You know why I called you? 

492
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,159
What's wrong with you?

493
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,100
Shanshan, Shi Yan was supposed to have dinner with me tonight.

494
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

495
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,180
 I'm a little afraid. 

496
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,360
What are you afraid of?

497
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:59,700
I'm afraid he'll be nice to me. I'm afraid he'll know the truth.

498
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,279
I'm afraid of hurting his feelings.

499
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:05,159
So you want to tell him. Right?

500
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,480
What are you thinking?

501
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,519
If you're so scared, you shouldn't tell him now.

502
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,199
Your relationship isn't stable yet.

503
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:21,440
Did you think I didn't see you pull your hand the last time we met in the lobby?

504
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,519
 Because even you're not confident that he'll believe your explanation. 

505
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:26,639
 And that he'll forgive you for your purposes in the first place. 

506
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,240
Isn't that right?

507
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,700
Even if I don't tell him, he'll find out from his niece one day.

508
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:38,139
- And when he does. 
  - And when he does, he'll have already been deeply in love with you. 

509
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,860
And he'll say. "It's okay, I forgive you.

510
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,820
It's important for us to be together."

511
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,940
Really?

512
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,639
 For people like Shi Yan. 

513
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,920
An intimate relationship is not a necessity.

514
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,820
When your relationship is still unstable, if you let him know that you deceived him,

515
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,200
it'll only ruin your relationship.

516
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,980
 Are you willing to lose him because of this? 

517
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,559
Anyway, just do more things to deepen your bond.

518
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:07,839
Forget about that for now.

519
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,439
I'll try.
