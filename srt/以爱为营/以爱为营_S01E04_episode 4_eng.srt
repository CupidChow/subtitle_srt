 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,000
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,600
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,800
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,300
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,600
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,600
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,100
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,200
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,800
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,600
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,000
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,500
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:28,000
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,200
   

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,100
   

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,800
I just heard something surprising.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,200
Yesterday, Xu Yuling interviewed Shi Yan, too.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,300
Why are you so calm?

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,000
I went to the chief editor's office this morning.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,100
And saw Xu Yuling submitting an article.

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,800
I was thinking that there were no interviews in the past two days,

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
so what kind of article would she submit?

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Just now in the tea room,

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,500
I overheard her saying she also interviewed Shi Yan.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,200
Do you know what is even more infuriating?

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,400
You know I read your interview outline.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,200
She basically completely stole your outline.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,610
What do you think is going on?

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,130
Really...

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,100
 Mr. Shi, did I say something wrong? 

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,200
I didn't follow the exact Q&amp;A in the outline.

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,000
But Shi Yan must have known it was identical.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,700
Yet he answered the same questions twice.

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,000
Xu Yuling is a liar.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yuling, you're awesome!

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
You were able to get an interview with Shi Yan.

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Yes, you're great!

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
That's nothing.

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Work harder and I'll also root for you two.

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
- Got it. 
 - Got it.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,700
My interview was intercepted.

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,400
My outline was stolen.

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,700
I was knocked down by a crazy horse.

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,500
God knows how many embarrassments have I caused in front of him!

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,400
Shi Yan's is a pretty good person.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Though he's busy, he took the interview twice.

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,600
He can be considered patient.

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,000
To say he's nice, he holds grudges.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,100
He's capricious and likes mocking people.

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
If you say he is not good, he seems to be a nice person.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,200
If you say he is not good, he seems to be a nice person.

58
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,800
But I couldnâ€™t tell anything at all during the interview.

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,500
This kind of person could win an Oscar.

60
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
I totally don't get him.

61
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,600
Mr. Shi, the evaluation report of Le'an was just released by the Marketing and Finance Department.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,200
At present, there is still room for price increase.

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,400
But do you really want to...

64
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,700
But where did they suddenly get such a large sum of money?

65
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,800
There will always be people who do profitable things.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Shuyi, it's been a while.

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,700
Where're you going? Need a ride?

68
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,800
Thank you, but no.

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
I'm alone.

70
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,800
Lezhi bought me the car.

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
I'll be working at Mingyu soon.

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,000
If you like driving so much, why don't you become a driver?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
Who is it?

74
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,000
What a nice car to be gifted to you.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,500
Who would give you a Mercedes-Benz worth 300,000 yuan?

76
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,000
How many days will it take before you can go to work?

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
It only takes one word from her uncle.

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,000
Why do you have to interview for several rounds before you can get in?

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
I think you should hurry up and become a driver.

80
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,400
And stop being an eyesore here.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Shanshan, you've got a silver tongue!

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
That was so well said!

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
With his psychological quality

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,300
he still fantasizes about a serial number car that he will never be able to ride in his life.

85
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,000
He's underestimating Shi Yan, and is overestimating himself.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,700
 Let her come over. 

87
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,800
 Ms. Zheng might want to ride this car. 

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's on your mind?

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Some people get a new car without even moving a finger.

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,300
Yet I worked so hard only to have my interview intercepted and my outline stolen.

91
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,600
Donâ€™t say such depressing words.

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Itâ€™s just your face that has ruined the country and brought disaster to the country and the people.

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Even I want to fall for your charisma.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,300
No man can resist it.

95
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,600
What captivates the country?

96
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,700
If you have to go overboard, just go overboard. If you want to throw me out of the car, just throw me out of the car.

97
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,600
I booked Situ Yi's time for you.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Do you have any idea how hard it is to book her?

99
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,900
Luckily we were acquainted when we studied at the same school.

100
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,400
We shared romance advice.

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,900
I even lent her clothes for her to dress up nicely for dates.

102
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,700
Otherwise, you wouldnever get to book an appointment with her.

103
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,000
Shanshan, thank you.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,800
Isn't this a feast to repay you?

105
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Honestly, Honey.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Even I can't resist your charms and lovely expression.

107
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,200
So what was Shi Yan's reaction?

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,100
Orâ€¦ do men prefer women playing hard to get and talk about their integrity?

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,400
What matters now isn't men's preferences

110
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,200
but the headline that I should get back.

111
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,400
This year, you're so obsessed with headlines.

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
It's not all for headlines.

113
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
- I just want toâ€¦ 
 - ...prove that you can upgrade e-publications.

114
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,200
- I just want toâ€¦ 
 - ...prove that you can upgrade e-publications.

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
You want to promote new ideas

116
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
become the voice of ordinary readers of financial news

117
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
and make an e-publication that's different from paper magazines.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,400
My ears are numb from constantly hearing those words.

119
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,300
But in outsiders' eyes, you're still competing for headlines.

120
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,300
As a matter of fact, wouldn't it be great to be a deputy editor?

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes, that's a nice job.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But it's not my goal.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,200
Embracing changes and upgrading e-publications is my career goal.

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Look.  My interview with Shi Yan.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,700
We were caught off guard when he temporarily changed the interview time.

126
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,400
But that won't happen to e-publications.

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,800
There are various ways to keep news current and distributed.

128
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
All it takes is a link to share.

129
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
This is a new reading habit for people to read.

130
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,200
And we can provide various forms of news.

131
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
So I won't give up.

132
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,500
I've planned a featured topic for the e-publication.

133
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,000
If it can be achieved. it will bring me a step closer to my goal.

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Mr. Shi, itâ€™s almost time to get off work and Iâ€™m here to disturb you.

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,400
No worries. Drink some water.

136
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Did something urgent happen?

137
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,800
After talking to you last time,

138
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,000
I've been thinking about what you said.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I've discussed it with my team.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,400
None of us want to miss the opportunity you provide.

141
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,400
So I'm here to discuss with you again

142
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,600
the amount of investment funding.

143
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Okay.

144
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,700
I am very happy that you can come to me at this time.

145
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,400
But please give me some time.

146
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
I understand.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
It takes time to come up with a new investment plan.

148
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,300
But I'm indeed under some pressure.

149
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm glad you'll reconsider my proposal.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

151
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Okay.

152
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
If I follow what you said,

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
you and Xu Yuling used the same outline.

154
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,000
Then it's hard to decide which one's better.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,600
Unless you can get something new.

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,800
You're right. Get something new.

157
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,500
I have to meet him again.

158
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,400
Find a chance!

159
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,500
Did you two ride together on horseback yesterday?

160
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,400
That makes you two acquaintances.

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm not even his Wechat friend.

162
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
We're not acquaintances.

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
And he's such a weirdo.

164
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Whether he wonders or not is irrelevant.

165
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,000
You need to toughen up, Zheng Shuyi.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,400
You're no longer doing this only for a headline.

167
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Your goal is to rise far above that cheater,

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,500
defeat the one who stole your interview,

169
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,700
and you are fighting for the upgrade of the e-journal that you have longed for!

170
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,300
I've delivered the stuff.

171
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
Remember to receive it.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,900
- Who is it? 
 - A boring man.

173
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,300
A man who's fallen for you?

174
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
You have so many suitors.

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,400
Are you sure none of them have piqued your interest?

176
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,600
You don't get it.

177
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,700
These are my principles:

178
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't refuse.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,200
Don't explain.

180
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
Don't ask for him to stay.

181
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
Besides, if he wants to defeat me with such a rudimentary trick,

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,000
he must be looking down on me.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,300
What trick?

184
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,400
He came over to my place to fix my stuff

185
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,700
but then deliberately left something behind so that we could meet twice.

186
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,800
There are still some people using such low-level tactics.

187
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,300
Speaking of which I also left something in Shi Yan's car.

188
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,060
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

189
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,920
That's a perfect chance!

190
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,348
Hello.

191
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,799
Mr. Shi, it's Ms. Zheng from Financial Introduce.

192
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,170
Hello.

193
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,440
Hi, Mr. Shi, I think I lost an earring in your car.

194
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Did you see it?

195
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,007
No.

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,760
The earring is really important to me. Could you please check again?

197
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,050
The earring is really important to me. Could you please check again?

198
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,899
How important?

199
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,000
More important than my life!

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,879
It's becauseâ€¦

201
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,059
It's an heirloom from my grandma to my mom

202
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,120
 and my mom to me. 

203
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,650
It's also a dowry.

204
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,630
I plan to wear it at my wedding,

205
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,659
 it'll remind me of my grandma. 

206
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,420
 I haven't seen her for such a long time. 

207
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,550
My grandma used to wrap it so carefully.

208
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,540
She wouldn't easily wear it.

209
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,760
Then, why did you wear it so easily?

210
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,679
That's becauseâ€¦

211
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,840
Since it's a precious heirloom,

212
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,100
I should wear it for important occasions such as the interview with you.

213
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,500
Even though it's made of plastic?

214
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,299
My family weren't well-off.

215
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:11,280
We used to be impoverished peasants ill-informed and simple-minded.

216
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,920
Though it's made of plastic. It was the most precious thing to my family back in the day.

217
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,080
Send it to her.

218
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,840
Ms. Zheng, when do you need it?

219
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,519
As soon as possible. I can't fall asleep without it.

220
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,379
 Got it, I'll send it over soon. 

221
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't want to trouble you.

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,359
Let me fetch it myself.

223
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,554
Okay.

224
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,080
Seriously, Shuyi?

225
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,812
You wore a pair of plastic earrings when interviewing Shi Yan?

226
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,579
What's wrong with plastics?

227
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,030
Plastics are the greatest invention in human history.

228
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,759
Plastics have altered our life!

229
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,046
How can we look down on it?

230
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,519
That's a bit far-fetched.

231
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,310
Despite your funny excuse, Shi Yan didn't hang up on you.

232
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,350
He even wanted to send it back.

233
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,825
Is he into you?

234
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,080
Bogang Cloudy Bay?

235
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,540
   

236
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,770
Look at the price.

237
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,910
It must be where Shi Yan lives.

238
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,679
That's a direct invitation.

239
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,780
Are you sure he's not into you?

240
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,520
There's no way. Heâ€¦

241
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,819
 He dropped me off downstairs and refused to dine with me. 

242
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,420
But he just bit your bait

243
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,720
and sent you his address.

244
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,179
He's quite impatient.

245
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,480
He isn't impatient.

246
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,679
Then it means only one thing that men are all the same.

247
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,896
Take my advice. Don't go when he's like this.

248
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,890
What are you doing?

249
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,019
Hard to get, you get it?

250
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,839
I get it, but not this time.

251
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,340
I have a plan to go over with Shi Yan.

252
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,177
What plan?

253
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,790
Uncle, why are you back?

254
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,140
Aren't you supposed to hang out with Guan Ji?

255
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,579
Didn't I tell you not to call him Guan Ji.

256
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,559
He said I could call him Guan Ji.

257
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,399
You haven't told me why you're back tonight?

258
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,159
This is my house.

259
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,734
If you don't want to see me here, please go back and stay with your grandpa.

260
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,310
Let me take these trophies back to my room.

261
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,879
Don't come out before I tell you.

262
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,470
   

263
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,500
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

264
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,069
â™«  Not accidentally  â™«

265
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,806
â™«  It's not just a coincidence  â™«

266
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:19,650
â™«  It's not just to hear the words "I'm sorry"  â™«

267
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,780
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

268
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,518
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

269
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:39,150
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

270
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,764
â™«  If love is like a cloud  â™«

271
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:47,925
â™«  Always erratic  â™«

272
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,767
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

273
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,632
Mr. Shi, I'm here for my earring.

274
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,997
â™«  I will also be cautious  â™«

275
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:01,223
â™«  I will also be breathless  â™«

276
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:06,005
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

277
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:10,359
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

278
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,372
Mr. Shi, you like Song Lelan, too!

279
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,320
What a coincidence!

280
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,459
I like her very much, too. I have all these albums.

281
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,920
Which song is your favorite?

282
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,428
â™«  Let flowing breaths fill my memory  â™«

283
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,303
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

284
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:32,879
 Why did you stand me up? 

285
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,800
 Chen Sheng says you're working. But Shiyue says you're home. 

286
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,639
 So, it's not for work. 

287
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:43,740
Be honest. Are you seeing someone?

288
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,740
 You haven't dated anyone for three years. 

289
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,359
Not now. I'm busy.

290
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,519
 That sounds even more suspicious. 

291
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,979
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

292
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,899
 Come, drink! 

293
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:57,100
Hello.

294
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,180
 Are you leaving me out? 

295
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,880
 No, I'm not. Cheers. 

296
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,859
This is weird.

297
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,676
He's in love?

298
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:12,363
   

299
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,350
Guan Ji!

300
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,320
What's on your mind?

301
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
Are you thinking about a woman?

302
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,359
I have to go. You go on.

303
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,500
Why are you in a hurry? Guan Ji!

304
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,440
What's with him today?

305
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,119
- What's going on? 
 - Huh?

306
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,012
Is there anything else you need?

307
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:42,380
Mr. Shi, are you busy with Le'an Technology's business?

308
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,519
Did you run into any trouble on that front?

309
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,319
My colleague is writing Liyingâ€™s manuscript. I am also interviewing Mr. Chen from Le'an.

310
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:56,459
If I guessed it right, there are different voices inside Cloud Innovation

311
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,717
regarding Lieying and Le'an.

312
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,940
During the interview, Lieying kept hinting that Cloud Innovation would fund them.

313
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,482
And Le'an revealed similar information.

314
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:14,419
But in our last interview, you said you were more into original tech innovation and the ownership of core tech.

315
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,000
So you prefer Le'an Technology.

316
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,440
But inside your company, there might be differing voices.

317
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,340
And if the Guans are going to be a part of it. Their take also matters.

318
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,480
And if the Guans Capital are going to enter, then their opinions are also very important.

319
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,967
Thatâ€™s why you will be very busy during this period.

320
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,985
So?

321
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:35,000
It so happens that I'm interviewing Chen Kang.

322
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,160
Soâ€¦ now that I'm interviewing you before your investment plan is settled,

323
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,879
I want to make exclusive serial interviews to cover all relevant parties,

324
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:48,280
such as Cloud Innovation, Le'an, and also Guan Group.

325
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:54,288
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

326
00:20:54,288 --> 00:21:00,436
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

327
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:06,161
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

328
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,100
Want something to drink?

329
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,938
Lemonade, thank you.

330
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,448
â™«  Blooming roses, gorgeous yet wither  â™«

331
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,465
â™«  Rose exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

332
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:36,045
â™«  Roses reveal a hidden ambiguity  â™«

333
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,488
â™«  Roses are the most dangerous yet noble  â™«

334
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:43,472
â™«  Roses are the most powerful and most beautiful  â™«

335
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:46,880
â™«  Roses carve fearlessness with their domination  â™«

336
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,559
Do you want ice?

337
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,060
I'm dying...

338
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,692
Pardon?

339
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,983
Ice.

340
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,920
Supposing you guessed it correctly,

341
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,340
what makes you think I can succeed?

342
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,260
Following your plan, how many headlines can you secure?

343
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,899
 A woman? 

344
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:33,956
 His girlfriend? 

345
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,260
 Shi Yan has a girlfriend? 

346
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,199
Mr. Shi, did I disturb your private time with your girlfriend?

347
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,360
Please consider my proposal.

348
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,419
My girlfriend?

349
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,540
The one in the room, isn't she your girlfriend?

350
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,122
No.

351
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:01,532
That's good.

352
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,300
Good? Where?

353
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,640
Uhâ€¦

354
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,380
To avoid misunderstanding.

355
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,839
Misunderstanding?

356
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,480
So if it's my niece, there's no misunderstanding?

357
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,680
Oh, your niece?

358
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,400
Niece? The cheaâ€¦

359
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,039
It's even worse if your niece misunderstands.

360
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,799
I'm leaving first. Sleep early.

361
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,960
Who was here?

362
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,000
I seem to have heard a woman's voice.

363
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,000
That was close.

364
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,410
I almost met Shi Yan's niece and fought.

365
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,070
Had we met...

366
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,519
the upgrade of e-publications would be beyond salvation.

367
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,859
 Leaving behind what she came for, she thinks it's a clever move. 

368
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,639
What're you looking at?

369
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,759
Who told you to come out?

370
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,759
Who was she?

371
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,564
Your girlfriend?

372
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,319
Uncle, I gave it some thought.

373
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:41,959
How about I stop going to work? Is it okay for me to do a study tour abroad?

374
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,719
A study tour? Do you deserve these two words?

375
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:54,900
Actually, why do people have to work so hard in vain?

376
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,480
Everyone in our family is an elite.

377
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,920
They work hard to earn money,

378
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,599
but none know how to enjoy life.

379
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,920
I think I can be the one to enjoy life.

380
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,880
If there must be someone to squander, I can do it.

381
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,359
You failed all chemistry exams in high school,

382
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,060
but you know more about makeup products than your chemistry teacher.

383
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,680
You went to a college overseas.

384
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,039
Yet you never learned to speak fluent English.

385
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,980
Still, that didn't prevent you from traveling across the world.

386
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,680
So no work is in vain.

387
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,640
It's whether you think it's in vain.

388
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,499
I know I was wrong.

389
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,699
But, Uncle,

390
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:40,699
I can do anything you ask me to do. But you can't send me to work.

391
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,200
I didn't even stay up late oncefor the college entrance exam.

392
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,160
Do I have to work 9 to 5 for a salary of several thousand yuan now?

393
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,359
And it's approaching the Spring Festival.

394
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,080
Let's wait till the festival is over.

395
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,559
Can we?

396
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,960
Please, Uncle.

397
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,777
Qin Shiyue,

398
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,803
my family doesn't simply provide for those who cannot make a living on their own.

399
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,599
Great!

400
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,340
You basically came up with all that on your own.

401
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,979
That shows you have great potential.

402
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:19,880
You went and left your earring.

403
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,659
This way you can meet him again.

404
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:25,400
That's ingenious.

405
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Call him now.

406
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,359
Book another appointment to his place.

407
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,202
Hurry.

408
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,119
I need to hang up. I'm in the middle of something.

409
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,279
Ingenious?

410
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,868
I didn't leave it there deliberately.

411
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:48,720
I didn't even get his number.

412
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,260
How can I call him?

413
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,820
I don't even know if the featured interviews will work.

414
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,800
God help me. What do I do?

415
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,380
What do I do?

416
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,240
They all say it's difficult to invite you out.

417
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,200
But you showed up.

418
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:14,819
That depends on who's inviting.

419
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:18,640
It's so late and the view isn't so good.

420
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,340
Let's go somewhere else.

421
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,440
   

422
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,604
   

423
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,079
Or perhapsâ€¦ let's grab a drink first.

424
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,260
Or do you want to...

425
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,359
go somewhere else directly?

426
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,659
I do want to go somewhere else.

427
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,000
But not with you.

428
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,359
I'm leaving.

429
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,090
Bye.

430
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
 Mr. Shi. 

431
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,699
 I think I lost an earring in your car. 

432
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,900
 Did you see it? 

433
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,379
 No. 

434
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:30,799
 The earring is really important. 

435
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,619
 Could you please check again? 

436
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,460
 How important? 

437
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,880
The chief editor asked Xu Yuling to go to her office.

438
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,379
Is she going to use Xu's story?

439
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,419
I did everything I should and shouldn't.

440
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,279
I have confidence in my story.

441
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,740
I did what I could.

442
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,680
Then leave it for the fates to decide.

443
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:25,944
Where are you going?

444
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:28,079
To wash up and get some air.

445
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,200
Then I'll keep exploring the value of journalism.

446
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,379
Whatever happens, my career will continue.

447
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,839
I'm so upset!

448
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,960
Shi Yan isâ€¦

449
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,279
I was so unlucky.

450
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,440
He didn't say anything useful, just some general stuff, nothing specific.

451
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,759
He didn't say anything useful, just some general stuff, nothing specific.

452
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,720
I'd prefer being directly refused than being fooled this way.

453
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,239
How hateful!

454
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,199
 Just something general? 

455
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,960
 I thought he gave me a lot of useful information. 

456
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,290
Who knows how she managed to interview Shi Yan?

457
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,300
You know what she's like, right?

458
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,020
A pretty face and unclear hands.

459
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,170
She still managed to persuade Tang Yi to use her story.

460
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,839
I suspectâ€¦

461
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,520
- Luckily, it's not broken. 
 - Thank you.

462
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,864
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

463
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,060
Calm down. Xu Yuling played dirty this time.

464
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,594
I've warned her.

465
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:50,440
This will count negatively into her KPI and annual review.

466
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,299
From now on, I'll do my best to prevent things like this.

467
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,419
This behavior of stealing other peopleâ€™s articles,

468
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,400
is a warning enough?

469
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,773
So you want me to

470
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:02,899
fire her?

471
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
She was desperate.

472
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,720
This year, none of her articles have made the headlines.

473
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,739
Financial journalism is a small circle.

474
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:13,919
Whether we fire her or she quits, the industry will definitely inquire about the reason.

475
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,880
Whether we fire her or she quits, the industry will definitely inquire about the reason.

476
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,300
This could damage her career.

477
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,597
Why are you so silent?

478
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,279
I understand that she stole my interview.

479
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,259
But why did she copy my outline?

480
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:31,499
Because yours was better than hers.

481
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:35,900
Her very behavior proved that you're better than her.

482
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,639
So you defeated her by a large margin this time.

483
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,339
What bigger punishment could there be for a journalist than the bitter fact

484
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:43,480
that someone's more capable than them?

485
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,259
I think she must've felt that bitterness.

486
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,379
Shuyi, you've got a long way to go along the path of journalism.

487
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,200
Don't push her to her limit.

488
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,440
So, Shi Yan chose my outline. Right?

489
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes.

490
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,799
He's got his rules. This time, too.

491
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,019
He didn't embarrass us and accepted Xu Yuling's interview,

492
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,920
while giving you enough information.

493
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,280
A win-win situation.

494
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,820
Huge EQ, impressive.

495
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,440
I must remind you of another thing.

496
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,319
Cloud Innovation and Shi Yan, both chose us first

497
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,039
and then picked one out of you two.

498
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,780
I understand.

499
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,719
All my achievements rely on our magazine, which is one of the best platforms in the industry.

500
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:41,880
So I want to ensure the quality of every single one of my stories.

501
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,380
This way, I won't tarnish our reputation.

502
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,580
Such a sweet and clever girl.

503
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,780
So don't waste your time on brooding.

504
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,720
It's so nice of you to say so.

505
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,680
And this sweet and clever girl is returning to her interviews.

506
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,575
Hello.

507
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,039
I'm not busy with anything.

508
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,740
I just had a heart-to-heart talk with a subordinate.

509
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,359
She's like me when I was young.

510
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,440
Persistent and persevering.

511
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,340
I've talked to HR.

512
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,400
We can take her as an intern.

513
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,919
But whether she can be admitted depends on herself.

514
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,340
Many people may think that I am more suitable for scientific research than entrepreneurship.

515
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,279
But my mentor has always encouraged me to apply what I have learned.

516
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,559
But my mentor has always encouraged me to apply what I have learned.

517
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,620
And more importantly, this country's industrial development needs us.

518
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,799
I had to give it a try.

519
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,119
In the past, in the chip field, everyone was still using traditional technology to make domestic substitutions.

520
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,480
In the past, in the chip field, everyone was still using traditional technology to make domestic substitutions.

521
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,480
So I think we should look for something new.

522
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,359
Though it could be risky.

523
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:57,720
Once we make it, it will be competitive worldwide

524
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,419
since we're no longer replicating other people's success.

525
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,200
After hearing your story,

526
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,119
I think you've been persistent and resolute all the way.

527
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,559
But have you ever questioned yourself or become hesitant about your decisions?

528
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:16,340
Honestly, the reason why I entered the industry and studied this technology

529
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,060
was that I wanted to serve our society.

530
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,580
But recently I realized that with Le'an Technology going so far,

531
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,219
if I still single-mindedly focus my attention on research

532
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:30,300
and ignore my team's thoughts and feelings, that would be selfish.

533
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,179
Le'an is not only mine.

534
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,119
It belongs to the whole team.

535
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,739
So to answer your question regarding my hesitations and doubts,

536
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:43,760
right now is the moment that I hesitate, doubt, and question.

537
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,180
Mr. Chen, though we face different problems, I understand you perfectly.

538
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,370
There may be some things that you are the only one insisting on at the beginning.

539
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,300
Every step is difficult.

540
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,440
Later, it was not easy when someone insisted on it together with you.

541
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,759
However, in this age,

542
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:05,959
to have a career goal and moving toward it, is already rewarding in itself.

543
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:10,660
I believe as long as we don't give up, there will be infinite possibilities.

544
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,709
â™«  The sun shines its first light  â™«

545
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:20,364
â™«  Do you want it as much as I do?  â™«

546
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:23,934
â™«  You desire to create brilliance  â™«

547
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:27,521
â™«  Even at the cost of getting bruises all over your body  â™«

548
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:32,599
â™«  In my arena, the world applauds for me  â™«

549
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:39,947
â™«  My promise to you will never grow cold  â™«

550
00:35:39,947 --> 00:35:43,047
â™«  Staying piping hot  â™«

551
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:46,851
Wow!

552
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
It's delicious, so awesome!

553
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,860
Uncle, you're as good in the kitchen as you are in the office.

554
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,159
Unstoppable charm!

555
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,139
Delicious? Then eat some more and hit the road.

556
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,179
Hit the road? Where?

557
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,360
Uncle, it just occurred to me that I have an appointment.

558
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,939
I'll get going. Enjoy your food.

559
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:28,239
Qin Shiyue, the moment you leave,

560
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,660
I will freeze your card.

561
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,100
 It doesn't matter if the card is frozen. 

562
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,519
 Grandpa can give me some allowance. 

563
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,860
You can ask your grandpa for help

564
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,840
but then don't ever think about coming back.

565
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,760
I'll change the password. You think carefully yourself.

566
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:52,500
Uncle, you've always been nice to me.

567
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,320
I'm your beloved niece

568
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,739
so you won't do that to me. Right?

569
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:00,179
I'm nice to you by forcing you to grow up.

570
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,239
I just returned from overseas.

571
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,880
Give me some time to get used to life here.

572
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
Stop pretending that you need time adjusting.

573
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
You've traveled all over the word since you were still a kid.

574
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,199
You adjusted just fine.

575
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,499
Uncle...

576
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:23,319
Whatever the case, I graduated from a famous overseas university.

577
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:26,799
How could you you send me on a job with a monthly salary of several thousands?

578
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:29,460
Don't you think it's not worth it?

579
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,119
You're thinking too highly of yourself.

580
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,339
An intern is not worth so much.

581
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,580
If not for money, why should I work?

582
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,099
We're not in want of money.

583
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:41,419
I'm neither a delinquent youngster nor a troublemaker.

584
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:43,759
Isn't it enough?

585
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,820
Qin Shiyue, a job is not just a tool for one to make money.

586
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,460
A job also reflects a person's social responsibility

587
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,479
and embodies their personal value.

588
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:58,600
Since you're not in want of anything and you're always energetic,

589
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,540
why not think about what you can do for society and others?

590
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Got any questions? If not, sit and eat.

591
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,139
After the meal, I'll give you a ride there.

592
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,899
Let's go.

593
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,250
Stop.

594
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,480
Good morning. Did you stay up late again?

595
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,499
I have some good news.

596
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:29,779
I heard that they're sending two interns to our department.

597
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:31,199
Good news, seriously?

598
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,700
Of course it's good. Didn't you want an intern?

599
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,719
You're so busy, so it's good to have someone to handle all the trivial stuff for you.

600
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,840
Then you won't have to stay up.

601
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,499
Stop being ridiculous. Itâ€™s not certain who will do chores for whom.

602
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,900
Do you know what she's doing?

603
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,640
I don't know, and its none of my business.

604
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,600
I heard she scored an interview with a big shot.

605
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,420
She's heading out for that interview.

606
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,168
That will surely make the next headline.

607
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,339
Oh. Best of luck, then.

608
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,739
Rest assured. We'll take good care of her.

609
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,979
She's just a bit late.

610
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,300
But it's just day one. She will get used to it.

611
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,480
No worries.

612
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,900
I have go back to work. Let's talk later.

613
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,920
This is our new intern, take a look.

614
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,360
My team doesn't need a new intern yet.

615
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,939
She can go to another team.

616
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:35,219
Xu Yuling's team has already taken one.

617
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:38,619
This one is for you to mentor.

618
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,919
Ms. Yi, my workload is reaching its limit.

619
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:44,620
I really don't have time and energy to be a mentor.

620
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,979
I knew you were busy,

621
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:49,000
so I found you a helper.

622
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,519
She can take pictures for you and organize files and stuff.

623
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,860
Let's be honest.

624
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,719
What's her background?

625
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,219
The only thing I can reveal is that we've thought of this carefully.

626
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:08,779
So I have to take her. Right?

627
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,940
Think of this as a mentor task I gave you.

628
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:24,060
Also, consider it a favor I owe you.

629
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,320
Sure.

630
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,859
Rest assured, Chief Editor. I will take good care of her.

631
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,739
Famous university and high tuition fees,

632
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:42,320
her family must be well-off.

633
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,119
Isn't it nice to just stay home?

634
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,839
Why choose journalism?

635
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,339
Nice, she's good-looking.

636
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,440
Her CV looks nice too.

637
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,400
She's from the same school as the lead editor.

638
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,180
A super-achiever! Why are you so upset?

639
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,920
Check her grades out.

640
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:01,793
