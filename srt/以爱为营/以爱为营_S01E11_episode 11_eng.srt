00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,625
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

4
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,600
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,300
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,888
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

7
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,325
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

8
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,699
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

9
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,950
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,125
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

13
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,525
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

14
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,475
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

15
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:12,945
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

16
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

19
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:36,125
   

20
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,111
   

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,959
Hello, may I ask who ordered this?

22
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,439
Here.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,200
Well, someone wants some cake.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,119
 Shi Yan, you want to humiliate me in front of so many people. 

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,200
 - He must really like her.  
 - I agree. 

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,100
Just eat it.

27
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,000
   

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,440
Wait a second. I am going to say hi to Mr. Cheng.

29
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,971
Okay.

30
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,439
Shi Yan finally got a new girlfriend.

31
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,060
After being dumped by Bei Lin, he was so depressed and left Mingyu.

32
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,140
That's why they call him "the runaway successor of Mingyu."

33
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,260
That's not true. Shi Yan left Mingyu at its most difficult time.

34
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,779
Bei Lin thought he was not responsible, so she dumped him.

35
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:05,019
Do you think Shi Yan's girlfriend knows about Shi Yan?

36
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,300
It doesn't matter. They all get what they want.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,939
Do you think that girl only likes Shi Yan's appearance, not his wealth?

38
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,699
You're right.

39
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,770
When did you get back?

40
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,360
Just now.

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,660
Really?

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,050
Oh.

43
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,299
What's wrong? Do you want to eat or drink something?

44
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,279
I am tired. Let's go back.

45
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,699
Let's go.

46
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,579
Let's send Ms. Zheng home first.

47
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,380
Got it, Mr. Shi.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,219
 Shi Yan finally got a new girlfriend. 

49
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:10,840
 What does it have to do with you? 

50
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,560
 After being dumped by Bei Lin, 

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,960
 he was so depressed and left Mingyu. 

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,740
 Depressed? 

53
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,539
 He went to start his own business. 

54
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,400
 That's why they call him "the runaway successor of Mingyu." 

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,620
 He didn't run away. 

56
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,780
 Can't you see him? 

57
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,380
 It's not true. Shi Yan left Mingyu at its most difficult time. 

58
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,760
 Bei Lin thought he was not responsible, so she dumped him. 

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,319
 Were you under his bed at the time? 

60
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,040
 How do you know that she dumped him? 

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,440
 Not responsible? 

62
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,979
 He's carrying Mingyu Cloud Innovation on his shoulders. 

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,620
 Do you think Shi Yan's girlfriend knows about Shi Yan? 

64
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,519
 What does it have to do with you? 

65
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,260
 Does it matter? They all get what they want. 

66
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,920
 Do you think that girl only likes Shi Yan's appearance, not his wealth? 

67
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,059
 I don't believe it. 

68
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,100
 Can't I just like Shi Yan's appearance? 

69
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,000
 Even if I like his wealth, what does it have to do with you? 

70
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,040
Mr. Shi, thank you for dinner.

71
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,759
I am leaving.

72
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:45,020
Zheng Shuyi.

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,180
I am talking to you. Didn't you hear me?

74
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,120
I heard you.

75
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,100
Are you in a hurry to go home?

76
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,839
No.

77
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,720
Are you in a hurry to go home to make cakes?

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,279
Shi Yan! You are so annoying.

79
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,839
Did you call me to say that?

80
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,979
What else do you want me to say?

81
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,419
Why are you unhappy?

82
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,059
I am not.

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,119
Did you learn anything from the dinner?

84
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,025
I heard something about you.

85
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:45,439
â™«  It's not just to hear the words "I'm sorry"  â™«

86
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,040
Do you believe them?

87
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,659
Of course not.

88
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,860
I only believe what you say.

89
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,220
You want to know me. Right?

90
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,120
Can't I?

91
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,440
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

92
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:13,973
â™«  If love is like a cloud  â™«

93
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,179
â™«  Always erratic  â™«

94
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,759
Aren't you in a hurry to go home?

95
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,040
I am not.

96
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:27,037
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

97
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:29,250
â™«  I will also be cautious  â™«

98
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,425
â™«  I will also be breathless  â™«

99
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:36,450
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

100
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,763
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

101
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:43,825
â™«  No need to ask, I am willing  â™«

102
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
What do you want me to say?

103
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,839
They said a lot about me. Right?

104
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,879
Bits and pieces of my past,

105
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,379
from life to work, they said it all.

106
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,039
 He heard everything. 

107
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,679
Were they under your table or bed?

108
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:09,000
How could they know everything about you?

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,280
If you can judge a person just by rumors and a few meetings,

110
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,119
If you can judge a person just by rumors and a few meetings,

111
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:17,120
I could say in my eyes, Shi Yan is a smart, far-sighted,

112
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
outstanding, and handsome young entrepreneur.

113
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,040
I didn't know that I was so good in your eyes.

114
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,639
I didn't know that I was so good in your eyes.

115
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,519
I'm just giving an example.

116
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,205
I don't know you.

117
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:39,780
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

118
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,450
â™«  But your eyes are avoiding me  â™«

119
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,660
What about now?

120
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,470
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

121
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:59,450
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

122
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:10,250
â™«  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  â™«

123
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,275
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

124
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,300
â™«  But I'm afraid it's too late  â™«

125
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,000
Hey! No parking here.

126
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,340
Ms. Zheng, are you all right?

127
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,739
I am all right.

128
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,000
 Please enter your password. 

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,139
 The door is open. 

130
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,359
7th floor.

131
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,859
Please leave here.

132
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,659
Mr. Shi, do you want me to send the clothes in the trunk to Ms. Zheng?

133
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,720
No need. Let's go.

134
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,460
 Shuyi, what are you talking about? 

135
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,880
 Are you drunk? 

136
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,499
 Shuyi, are you all right? 

137
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,040
 What's your problem? 

138
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,300
 It's not good to bother someone so late. 

139
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,987
   

140
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,779
Good job.

141
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:30,960
You should let him know that guys are pursuing you.

142
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,880
He is now jealous.

143
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,360
Or he wouldn't do the cake thing. Right?

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,560
I think he's going to dream of you.

145
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,960
 But you mustn't give him anything back. 

146
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,419
You have to make him curious,

147
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,319
have him come to you and pursue you.

148
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:55,720
Listen. Don't worry about what he thinks of you.

149
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,060
What is the nature of a man?

150
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,120
It's their nature to conquer.

151
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,980
If there's no one pursuing you or you are too easy to get,

152
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,760
 he will not cherish you. 

153
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,240
You have to get him to pursue you.

154
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,619
It's useless for you to pursue him.

155
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,320
 What happened then? 

156
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:16,600
Thenâ€¦

157
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,540
Then I called you.

158
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,839
That's all?

159
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,260
He sent you home.

160
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,680
 But you did nothing? 

161
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,899
Then I went home.

162
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,000
All right. I can't talk to you.

163
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,859
I have to go.

164
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,560
 Don't be proactive. 

165
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,839
 Never too near or too far. 

166
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,060
Nice wine.

167
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,180
But the glass is too cold.

168
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,159
You have so many means.

169
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,817
Aren't you afraid that someone will fall in love with you?

170
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,159
They'd better not.

171
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,764
They won't be able to get out.

172
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,580
- Youâ€¦ 
 - What's wrong?

173
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,039
I am fine.

174
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,180
I am fine.

175
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,500
What do you want?

176
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,180
I'll get changed and take you to the hospital.

177
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,179
I don't want to go.

178
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:48,579
You have a bruise.

179
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:50,759
I have plans tomorrow.

180
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,779
Hello, I need band-aids. Iâ€¦

181
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,159
It's useless for me to pursue him.

182
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,379
About today, I don't know what he means.

183
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,040
We all know that more efficient and safer batteries

184
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,000
are the pain points of the development of the new energy vehicle industry.

185
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,659
Finding battery companies with potential for long-term development

186
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,000
is the key for us to enter this industry.

187
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,760
Zhanlan now has a very high market share.

188
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,879
After this round of financing, their market share will be higher.

189
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,940
Zhanlan is a good choice.

190
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,319
But the competition is strong.

191
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,399
Many companies now look like they are winning.

192
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,300
Zhanlan is now in a leading position in the industry.

193
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,500
But can they break through the technical hurdles of all-solid-state batteries,

194
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,200
and continue to lead the industry?

195
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Mr. Shi, there's nothing wrong with taking a long-term view.

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,940
But Zhanlan is the best choice right now.

197
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,840
Maybe you're thinking too much.

198
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,999
Rating and Valuation Department, what's your idea?

199
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,640
Such a large investment is indeed risky for Cloud Innovation.

200
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,140
But we've done detailed calculations.

201
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,340
According to Zhanlan's current profitability,

202
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,799
we can make a profit on this investment.

203
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,039
The promise of solid-state batteries is promising.

204
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,380
But the R&amp;D cycle is long and costly.

205
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,839
We need to be prudent.

206
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,319
To take Zhanlan, more needs to be done.

207
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:55,160
I think we can give it a shot.

208
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,680
Zhanlan has been at the forefront of the solid-state battery revolution.

209
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,140
With this investment,

210
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,779
it could widen the gap with other companies,

211
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,880
and become an industrial leader.

212
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,340
I'm very optimistic about them.

213
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,519
Yes.

214
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,599
Since Mr. Shi has concerns,

215
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,920
we can shorten the investment cycle and cash out quickly.

216
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,059
we can shorten the investment cycle and cash out quickly.

217
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,940
Since everyone is optimistic about this industry,

218
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,720
we will advance the work of research and evaluation

219
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,300
to determine where we go next.

220
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,680
That's all for today. Dismissed.

221
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:41,179
Mr. Tian and Mr. Zhang are abnormal.

222
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,647
It's not hard to understand.

223
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,607
Short-term investments of large amounts of money may yield high returns.

224
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,480
No investment firm will pass up this opportunity.

225
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,499
That's why there are so many competitors.

226
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:54,462
That's who they are.

227
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:57,460
Zhanlan is the leader in the solid-state battery industry.

228
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,140
I've read the report. They have lots of orders.

229
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,640
But their factories are overloaded.

230
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,340
I think after receiving this round of investment,

231
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,220
they will spend the money on expanding production

232
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,600
rather than on technology R&amp;D.

233
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:13,759
It's possible.

234
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,079
Maintaining and expanding market share is a top priority for many companies.

235
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,439
What are you going to do next?

236
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,260
The report is all about the past.

237
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,900
We can only rely on ourselves.

238
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,320
So I'm going to do the research myself.

239
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,259
Shi Yan, I have an idea.

240
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,219
You can start preparing.

241
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,960
What are you talking about?

242
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,939
Shi Yan.

243
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:47,299
 Yi, have you eaten? 

244
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,600
 How have you been? 

245
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,000
 Are you busy with your work? 

246
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,900
Not so busy.

247
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,939
 Are you free this weekend? 

248
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,739
Mom, why are you being weird?

249
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,240
Weird?

250
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,920
I am not. I am just worried about you.

251
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,379
 You care about the future. 

252
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,960
As an old saying goes, let the past be the past.

253
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,380
 You should grasp the future. 

254
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,220
Yi, remember when I told you

255
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,340
 about the dean's son who came back from studying abroad? 

256
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,640
 He is in Jiangcheng now. 

257
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
Why don't you go meet him this weekend?

258
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,839
You can get to know each other. And become friends.

259
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,839
Are you asking me to go on a blind date?

260
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,219
 No. 

261
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,440
I want you to get to know each other.

262
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,600
Don't you young people like to socialize online and meet offline?

263
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,440
 I tell you. He is handsome. 

264
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm not interested in his educational background and wealth.

265
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,319
Then you're interested in his appearance.

266
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,780
 If you like him, 

267
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,550
you meet him.

268
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,060
Watch it. I am your mother.

269
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,960
It's rude.

270
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,159
Yi, you are young.

271
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,040
You shouldn't be single for too long.

272
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,160
 Or you will get used to it. 

273
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,200
 You will lose the ability to love someone. 

274
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,799
I'm giving you a lesson.

275
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,559
I don't need it.

276
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,960
 Tell me. What kind of guy do you like? 

277
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,599
He has to be older than me,

278
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,160
27 years old or older.

279
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,720
 Neither too tall nor too short, 

280
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,279
 183 cm would be great. 

281
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,780
He'd better be in finance, so we have something in common.

282
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,640
What a coincidence. He's everything you're looking for.

283
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,800
No way.

284
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,239
Is his name two words?

285
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,200
Yes.

286
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
 I will share his WeChat with you. You can contact him.

287
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,800
You can contact him. There are his photos in his Moments.

288
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,500
Just check it out. You will see.

289
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,679
 If you don't think you're a good matchâ€¦ 

290
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,855
Can we stop it?

291
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,279
It's fine if you don't match.

292
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,350
I will introduce you to the other guys

293
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,500
 until you are satisfied. 

294
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,558
   

295
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,339
 What do you say? Is that all right? 

296
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,920
All right.

297
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,279
I will meet him.

298
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,180
I told you he's a good guy.

299
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,119
Remember to go this weekend.

300
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,459
Meeting.

301
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,340
Mom, I have to go. I'm going to a meeting.

302
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,559
Shuyi. Yuling.

303
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,140
You attended the Cloud Innovation Annual Strategy Press Conference.

304
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,620
You will work on the front page of the Year-end issue together.

305
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,699
I hope you will pull together making a great wrap-up for Finance Introduce.

306
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:54,480
I hope you will pull together making a great wrap-up for Finance Introduce.

307
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,219
That's it.

308
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,160
Shuyi, you are in charge of the final compilation and editing.

309
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,340
Do you have any other questions?

310
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,780
No.

311
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,980
You are doing great.

312
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,440
Keep working hard.

313
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,380
There are two more issues left this year.

314
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,720
Don't slack off. Work hard.

315
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,119
And have a great Spring Festival.

316
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,640
Okay, break up.

317
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,319
Shuyi, come to my office.

318
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,349
You are doing great.

319
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:40,860
The lead editor and I are very optimistic about you.

320
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,839
The deputy editor is vacant.

321
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,203
Work hard. You will surpass me.

322
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:49,680
Ms. Yi, you know me. That's not my intention.

323
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,640
Shuyi, the medium doesn't matter,

324
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,299
the manuscripts matter.

325
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,839
A great manuscript will always be great.

326
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,120
But manuscripts and interviews are time-sensitive.

327
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,720
Interaction with readers is also important.

328
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,559
The lead editor has his concerns.

329
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,139
In the current situation of print media, we are doing okay.

330
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:09,960
If you want to increase manpower and budget,

331
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,799
it will be difficult for him.

332
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,420
It's because of the situation that I want to upgrade the e-newsletter.

333
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,820
It may be good for us to adapt to

334
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,460
the needs and reading habits of readers.

335
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,040
I understand you.

336
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,420
The truth is that Financial Introduce is a monthly magazine.

337
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,239
The truth is that Financial Introduce is a monthly magazine.

338
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,160
We are in equilibrium.

339
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,259
If we put all our energy into upgrading the e-newsletter,

340
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:35,460
it will require lots of manuscripts, manpower, and money for us to realize it.

341
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,259
I understand.

342
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:39,479
That's why I want to give it a shot.

343
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:43,919
I will write articles, both printed and digital. I only need my current team.

344
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,559
Finish this year's work first.

345
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,200
And think about the front page of the first issue of next year.

346
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,079
If you can do it well, I will talk to the lead editor about upgrading the e-newsletter.

347
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,219
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

348
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,920
Professor Yu.

349
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,660
You didn't expect your blind date to be me. Right?

350
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,479
Shuyi.

351
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,880
Sit.

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,079
You knew that your blind date was me.

353
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,580
I knew it was you. So I came.

354
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,640
And you got dressed up.

355
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,319
My blind date is you. I have to dress up to show my respect.

356
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,899
Since you know it's me, why didn't you text me on WeChat?

357
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,500
My mom is smart.

358
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,799
If I texted you, she would ask me for my chat history.

359
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,060
Then she will know we know each other.

360
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,519
What do you want to drink?

361
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,179
Anything.

362
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:56,759
Waitress.

363
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,520
 How do I look? 

364
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,000
 Reply to me with a word that starts with "G". 

365
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,939
 General. 

366
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,160
 When will you get your stuff back? 

367
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,700
Shuyi, it's time for a meal.

368
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,599
Let's eat something together.

369
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,459
No, thanks. I am not hungry.

370
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,460
I have something to do later. I'll take a rain check.

371
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,480
Okay.

372
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,380
 What did I forget? 

373
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,399
 Mr. Shi... 

374
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,060
 Are you talking about my heart? 

375
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,397
   

376
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:37,220
 The clothes you bought on the day of the dinner. 

377
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,659
I forgot it.

378
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,160
No, I can't return it any later.

379
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,959
 I've been so busy lately that I forgot it. 

380
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,860
 Could you send it to me? 

381
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,200
 I need it urgently. 

382
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,359
 Pretty please. 

383
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,299
 I am busy. 

384
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,319
 I don't have time to send it to you. 

385
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,240
 What are you busy with? 

386
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,880
 With your cakes? 

387
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:28,119
Can't he forget it?

388
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,339
 I will go now. 

389
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:36,819
 Wait for me. 

390
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,480
Mister, excuse me. I want to change my destination.

391
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay.

392
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:15,360
Yue, call your uncle.

393
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,799
Okay.

394
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,499
Hello.

395
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:40,680
 Uncle, the dinner is ready. When will you be back? 

396
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,720
You guys eat. I'm not going home.

397
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,220
Come back when you're done.

398
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,539
We will wait for you. Until you get home.

399
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,480
Eat with your grandpa. I have something to do.

400
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,880
 But you need to eat something. 

401
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,340
I am cooking.

402
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,840
Grandpa, my uncle said he was cooking. He won't come back for dinner.

403
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,540
Give it to me.

404
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,569
Shi Yan, you haven't been home for dinner for days.

405
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,619
Dad, I'll be home in a few days.

406
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:19,079
 I heard you are dating an actress. 

407
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:22,180
Who told you that?

408
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,200
People. I don't know who said that.

409
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,680
Just tell me yes or no.

410
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,260
No. She just loves to act.

411
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,279
 Dad, I have to go. 

412
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,500
Grandpa, he is really seeing someone?

413
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:52,725
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

414
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:58,625
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

415
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:04,676
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

416
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:11,770
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

417
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,525
â™«  Blooming roses, gorgeous yet wither  â™«

418
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:17,825
â™«  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

419
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:21,775
â™«  Roses reveal a hidden ambiguity  â™«

420
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,775
â™«  Roses are the most dangerous yet noble  â™«

421
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:29,650
â™«  Roses are the most powerful and most beautiful  â™«

422
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,650
â™«  Roses carve fearlessness with their domination  â™«

423
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:40,625
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

424
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,600
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

425
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,620
You are done. Where were you?

426
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,400
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

427
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

428
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,675
Come on in.

429
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:58,625
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

430
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:06,850
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

431
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,240
So much food.

432
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,880
 What a nerd. 

433
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,299
Mr. Shi, it's a long day. I didn't eat.

434
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,620
There are many dishes. You can't eat them up.

435
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,559
It's a waste.

436
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,100
If you don't want to waste them, sit down and eat them up.

437
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,460
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

438
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,580
I must respect food and eat it all up.

439
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,195
It's delicious.

440
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,760
Which restaurant did you get this from? It tastes great.

441
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,519
You will never know.

442
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,459
Don't look down on me.

443
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,020
It's delicious.

444
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,539
If I can eat such meals every day,

445
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,480
I would be so happy.

446
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,379
It's not that difficult.

447
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:36,939
You are right.

448
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:41,519
As long as I work hard, I can eat such meals.

449
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,160
So, about the feature interview of Mingyu Cloud Innovation,

450
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,760
what do you think?

451
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,200
Can we move forward with it?

452
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,680
I don't talk about work after work.

453
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
You said it was not that difficult.

454
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,400
Talking while eating can cause indigestion.

455
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,900
 Shuyi, are you free? 

456
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,300
 Call me. 

457
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,400
Checking your phone while eating is bad for your stomach.

458
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,500
 Ms. Yi, I'm not free. I'll call you soon. 

459
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Mr. Shi, I am stuffed.

460
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,200
Mr. Shi, where is my stuff?

461
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
Here's your stuff.

462
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,300
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

463
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,200
- Zheng Shuyi. 
 - Please stay.

464
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,700
See you, Mr. Shi.

465
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,400
She loves to take things and bum meals.

466
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,900
 Shuyi, there's an international industry forum in Wu city these two days. 

467
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,800
 You go there. 

468
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
Okay, I will go tomorrow.

469
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,100
 Thank you. 

470
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,300
Shanshan, I am at Bogang Cloudy Bay again.

471
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,100
Shanshan, I am here.

472
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,000
Sorry, I'm late.

473
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
- Here. Drink it up as punishment. Drink it up. 
 - Okay.

474
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,600
You should drink a lot. Fill it.

475
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,400
Come on. Fill it.

476
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,900
Excuse me.

477
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,600
- Great. 
 - Bravo.

478
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Good for you.

479
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,900
- Hello. 
 - Long time.

480
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,800
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

481
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,000
Shanshan, do you know him?

482
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,200
He is Mr. Guan. The CEO of Guan Capital.

483
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,800
We've met.

484
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,600
We met at the conference.

485
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Shanshan is a journalist of Entertainment Buzz.

486
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You look better in person.

487
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,000
Shanshan, be careful.

488
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,400
This young master mouth is so good at coaxing people.

489
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
He is a beauty hunter.

490
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,500
He's not my type.

491
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,200
I don't like sweet guys. I like hot guys.

492
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,780
Here. I will make a toast to you.

493
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,900
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

494
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,400
Qin Shiyue has really made a great contribution to Jiangcheng's GDP with her own efforts.

495
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,800
Qin Shiyue has really made a great contribution to Jiangcheng's GDP with her own efforts.

496
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
Hello, Miss.

497
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,800
Miss, are you an online store owner?

498
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,500
No, I want to return these.

499
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,900
All of them?

500
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,900
- It must be a horrible shop. 
 - I bought too much.

501
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,900
- Thank you. 
 - No worries.

502
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,200
How can I get to know him?

503
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,600
It would be great if I got his WeChat.

504
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,800
Yue, don't slack off.

505
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I am keeping an eye on you for Shuyi.

506
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,500
   

507
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
I misjudged you.

508
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,800
You're making rapid progress.

509
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,800
Yu You is a big hit. He's worth studying.

510
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,000
Shu Yi interviewed him at the University of Finance and Economics.

511
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,900
Work on it. It will help you a lot.

512
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,700
Interview him at the University of Finance and Economics?

513
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,000
   

514
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,500
As finance students, you may have a dream to be an investor.

515
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,500
What is the most important thing for an investor?

516
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,200
The most important thing is to perform DD.

517
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,300
What is DD? DD is short for due diligence.

518
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,900
It's a comprehensive and in-depth review of the historical data and documents of an enterprise,

519
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,000
as well as the background of the management personnel,

520
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,700
market risk, management risk,

521
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,500
technology risk, and capital risk

522
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,700
conducted by the investor and the intermediary

523
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,000
with the cooperation of the enterprise.

524
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
The cycle is about three to six months.

525
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,000
I didn't expect him to be so handsome without a suit.

526
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,500
He's more handsome than at the press conference.

527
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,000
My god.

528
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,500
Please grant me a teacher like him.

529
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,400
You must think it's boring to memorize definitions.

530
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,800
But these are important.

531
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,500
You have to memorize the four risks.

532
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,400
It will be in the next class quiz.

533
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,200
Write it down.

534
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,800
We can't just look at the surface,

535
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,600
we need to dig deeper.

536
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,500
Hey, which page is it?

537
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,300
The definition is difficult to understand.

538
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,200
I will simplify it.

539
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
I use our life as an analogy.

540
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,300
If you want to get to know someone you don't know,

541
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,400
you need to learn about him as much as possible.

542
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,000
You will do a background check on him.

543
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,800
You need to learn about him from different dimensions and levels

544
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,600
to make up for the asymmetry and imperfection of information between you.

545
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,300
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

546
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:07,000
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

547
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,000
Come to me if you have any questions.

548
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,100
- Professor Yu, see you. 
 - Thank you.

549
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,800
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

550
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,500
Professor Yu.

551
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,600
Professor Yu,

552
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,800
may I have your WeChat?

553
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I want to ask you something I donâ€™t understand.

554
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
What's the problem? You can ask me now.

555
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,400
What are your questions?

556
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
Professor Yu, don't you remember me?

557
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,500
Last time, at the Cloud Innovation Annual Strategy Press Conference at the financial center,

558
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,600
you helped me take out my coffee.

559
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,900
I remember you. What do you want?

560
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,600
I want to meet you.

561
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,400
Last time we didn't have time to talk. I didn't get your WeChat.

562
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,000
You crossed the city just to get my WeChat?

563
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,900
Not exactly.

564
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,200
I'm an intern of Financial Introduce.

565
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,100
I came to study.

566
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
You're a journalist of Financial Introduce?

567
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,300
Yes, I am an intern.

568
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,600
Ms. Shuyi is my leader.

569
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
You follow Shuyi?

570
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,600
Can I come to your class again?

571
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,900
You can.

572
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,400
But there is one thing. You. canâ€™t desert during class next time

573
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,500
I teach finance. You can buy a textbook online.

574
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,400
If you can't get it online, tell me before you come to my class.

575
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,300
I will prepare a textbook for you.

576
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,800
 What? 

577
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,000
You left with your stuff after dinner?

578
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,100
Yes.

579
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,400
 Good for you, Zheng Shuyi. 

580
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,600
The chief editor wanted me. What could I do?

581
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,400
 No wonder Shi Yan ignores you. 

582
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,400
What should I do?

583
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,800
Where are you?

584
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
 I'm on a business trip in Wu City. 

585
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,200
Take a photo and post it on Moments.

586
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,800
 What should I say? 

587
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,700
Nothing.

588
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,500
Nothing?

589
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,400
 Listen to me. 

590
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,000
Post anything interesting on Moments.

591
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,600
Okay.

592
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,030

â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

â™«  Can a happy ending be fixed?  â™«

â™«  Meeting you, approaching you  â™«

â™«  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  â™«
