00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
♫  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  ♫

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,625
♫  Dreams in winter are too fragile  ♫

4
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,675
♫  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  ♫

5
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,300
♫  Intoxicated under the sunset  ♫

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,825
♫  The light fades through my fingertips  ♫

7
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:48,325
♫  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  ♫

8
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,611
♫  Let time no longer be boring  ♫

9
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:53,950
♫  The evening breeze blows gently  ♫

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,125
♫  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  ♫

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,200
♫  A sip of summer intoxication  ♫

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,725
♫  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  ♫

13
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:06,450
♫  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  ♫

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,585
♫  Stop frowning  ♫

15
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:13,045
♫  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  ♫

16
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,400
♫  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  ♫

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,250
♫  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  ♫

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,975
♫  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  ♫

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,124
   

20
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:39,032
   

21
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:49,031
♫  Let the tears struggle and fall  ♫

22
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:55,782
♫  Are you just a passerby from now on?  ♫

23
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:01,078
♫  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  ♫

24
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,385
♫  Does it hurt  ♫

25
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:09,570
♫  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  ♫

26
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,587
♫  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  ♫

27
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:21,217
♫  Don't go far, okay?  ♫

28
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:25,399
I'll be off then.

29
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,240
Stay a bit longer, will you?

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,000
I fear it's a dream that'll shatter at dawn.

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,920
- Are you cold? 
 - Not when you're around.

32
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,180
But… I really should get going.

33
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,320
I have to go to the office tomorrow morning.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,800
Xingzhou, do give a thought to my proposal.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,920
What she can give you, I can give you too.

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,799
But what she can't, I can too.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,359
Well then.

38
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:56,439
My uncle's waiting for me. I have to go.

39
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,840
- Let me walk you there. 
 - Okay.

40
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:23,740
 My mom got this from a temple. One for love and marriage. 

41
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,559
 Put this on and we can stay together happily forever. 

42
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,840
 Forever, huh? 

43
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,339
Shuyi...

44
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,539
Shuyi, I can explain.

45
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,920
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

46
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,099
No need for an apology.

47
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:40,159
Let's break up. Wish you a happy life.

48
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,240
Shuyi. Shuyi!

49
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,302
Shuyi.

50
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,592
Let's break up.

51
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,800
Shuyi, I love you so much.

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
I want to be with you forever.

53
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,419
But… But I can't live like this.

54
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,939
I can't see the destination.

55
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,476
What do you mean?

56
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,650
Before meeting her, I always had faith in hard work

57
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,880
in that I could meet your expectations.

58
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,740
But then I realized.

59
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,900
People like us young and poor and unattached working our butts off in a big city,

60
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,338
even with a lifetime— no, ten lifetimes,

61
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:53,515
-we're no match for people born with silver spoons.

62
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,399
I'm giving up. I don't have enough motivation and ambition.

63
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,339
I'm not like you.

64
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:07,459
You with your big journalist dream believing you can achieve something with your hands.

65
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:13,020
Do you know what her family is like? The license plates of the cars her uncle drives all have consecutive numbers.

66
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:20,159
This is my only chance.

67
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,826
I'm sorry, Shuyi.

68
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:27,220
If you don't mind, we can remain best friends.

69
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,802
Yue Xingzhou.

70
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
Did you bring my cellphone?

71
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,241
Yes.

72
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,839
Remain friends? Dream on!

73
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,710
No way.

74
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,419
 What a day! I got totally soaked. 

75
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,579
 Get yourself a hot ginger tea lest you catch a cold. 

76
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,700
   

77
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,103
   
   

78
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,399
 - Your wine. 
 - Thank you. 

79
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:31,940
 This is a nice bar. 

80
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,800
 - Yes. 
 - I feel it's really nice. 

81
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,860
 Working overtime every day, I'm this close to a breakdown. 

82
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,940
 I must hang out with you guys. 

83
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,480
 You still working on that project? 

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,959
 Ugh, yeah… 

85
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,460
   
 What's wrong? Didn't get to interview him? 

86
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:59,199
   

87
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:05,220
 Thunder will strike you regardless of your poor judgment in love. 

88
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,000
What a lovely little melon head you have, simple and cute indeed.

89
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,940
What do you mean?

90
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,600
You only bought me a drink.

91
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,339
That's not enough for the next step.

92
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,940
Can you believe it?

93
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,170
He only took the most valuable item.

94
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,499
A golden brooch.

95
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,800
What a genius!

96
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,480
Let me tell you.

97
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm actually not so mad about breaking up.

98
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,099
But after seeing that, I was so close to dying on the spot...

99
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,220
This close, by a little bit!

100
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,839
There, there. Don't get so worked up.

101
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,753
It's not worth it.

102
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:10,200
I told you already that he was not good enough for you.

103
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,480
Such a hopeless underdog hurting your precious heart.

104
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,398
He's not worth it.

105
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,759
I will turn my anger into fuel.

106
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,075
Tomorrow, let me keep impressing Shi Yan at work.

107
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:31,122
Be honest with me. He dumped you.

108
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:33,599
Are you upset?

109
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,040
The only thing that upsets me is that he dumped me for a car.

110
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,978
Had I known, I should've given that car a good kick.

111
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,459
Thank goodness you didn't.

112
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,360
Otherwise, they'd have you pay.

113
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,399
Remember when Yue Xingzhou

114
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,100
made the whole school know that he was head over heels for you.

115
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,720
I gave you a warning.

116
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,003
Then you started working.

117
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:54,459
The whole office knew he was into you.

118
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,526
I warned you again.

119
00:10:56,526 --> 00:11:00,971
How unfortunate perseverance must be so touching.

120
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,792
He pursued me for an entire five years.

121
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,029
And as soon as we got together, he cheated on me.

122
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,940
How can a person change so easily?

123
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,799
Because once you start working,

124
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,500
you'll realize that bread is more important than love.

125
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,360
That's why I keep saying the wise should say no to romance.

126
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
Women should focus on their careers.

127
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,840
Only yourself and what you get from hard work

128
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,740
will never betray you.

129
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,987
I get it, but I'm mad that I lost to a car.

130
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:34,039
If you're so mad, prove you're better.

131
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,079
Makes sense.

132
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,360
Cheers!

133
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:42,249
It's piping hot!

134
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:26,639
   

135
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,600
Eight… nine…

136
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,440
She is so great. But didn't get recommended.

137
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:39,182
   

138
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,279
Three years, too.

139
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,419
 Uncle. 

140
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,850
   

141

♫  Going with the flow of the waves  ♫

142
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:46,501
♫  Waiting on the station platform of time  ♫

149
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:12,279
- Morning, Yuling. 
 - Morning.

150
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,299
How was the interview yesterday?

151
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:18,647
Mr. Shi was busy. The interview was rescheduled.

152
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,739
Mr. Shi is quite capricious.

153
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:25,880
No worries. That's why we journalists face changes and more changes.

154
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
- Yesterday… 
 - I didn't get to interview Shi Yan. He had other plans.

155
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,639
I'm rescheduling with Assistant Chen.

156
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,639
I'll complete the story in time.

157
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,719
Why're you wearing sunglasses?

158
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,420
Is it too bright in here?

159
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,399
The interview was canceled last night

160
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,360
so you didn't miss your boyfriend's birthday.

161
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,740
But you don't look well.

162
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,899
He cheated on you?

163
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,039
Oh, that was a shot in the dark.

164
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,499
Yue Xingzhou cheated on you?

165
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,580
Ms. Yi, why do you look so amused when my boyfriend cheated on me?

166
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,679
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

167
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,919
I-I'll try not to look amused.

168
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,181
Shuyi,

169
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,498
I told you.

170
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:40,039
You two were not a good match.

171
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,500
You'll understand when you reach my age.

172
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,380
For two people to be together,

173
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,840
it's important to be compatible.

174
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,679
Okay, Yue Xingzhou and I are not compatible.

175
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,440
Then who's compatible?

176
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,219
You're well-educated, lovely, have a nice job, and a bright future.

177
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,702
You're right. I am going to work.

178
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,526
Hang on.

179
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,699
Do you need to take a few days off to recover?

180
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,380
I got these dark circles because I burned the midnight oil to write Shi Yan's interview outline.

181
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,519
They have nothing to do with that cheater.

182
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,159
Splendid, keep your fighting spirit.

183
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,339
Le'an Technology just confirmed Chen Kang's interview.

184
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,259
I'll let you cover it for a change.

185
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,039
You've got more fight in you than me back in the day.

186
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,679
Giving preferential treatment all day long,

187
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,852
she has no fear because of her support.

188
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,360
That's decided then, Ms. Zheng.

189
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,260
We're a start up company.

190
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,179
I hope the interview can increase our publicity,

191
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,000
and boost investors' faith in us.

192
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,340
Mr. Chen isn't very talkative.

193
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,919
Please take that into consideration.

194
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,399
Thank you for the heads up. And I'm grateful you chose us.

195
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:24,679
I'll make thorough preparations.

196
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,800
Mr. Chen can rest assured that we'll only discuss topics he's familiar with.

197
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,999
All right, I'll head back then.

198
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,443
Okay.

199
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:04,490
 It's a nice day. Let's go shopping tonight. 

200
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,110
 Sure. 

201
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,699
The tarts are on sale; buy one get one free.

202
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:46,060
Okay. I'll have this.

203
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,300
- Got it. 
 - Thank you.

204
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,140
When will you ask your uncle to hire me?

205
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,860
I heard that he's interested in my company.

206
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,500
I should be able to help him.

207
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,100
Xingzhou, Mingyu has a strict hiring system.

208
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,000
It's not easy to get someone in.

209
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,720
Even I went through rounds of checks.

210
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,539
And my uncle doesn't want any special arrangements in the office.

211
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,280
You want to leave a good impression. Right?

212
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,357
Then take it slow, okay?

213
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:16,060
Got it.

214
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,580
But when are you going to tell your uncle?

215
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,079
I'm… just thinking about our future.

216
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,240
I don't want to keep you waiting.

217
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:32,519
Xingzhou, I'm hungry! I want to have a tart.

218
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:42,740
Shuyi, this is Qin Yue.

219
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,340
Excuse me. I need to borrow this place for a moment.

220
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,619
What are you looking at?

221
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,859
So you like a used man. Impressive.

222
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,860
Xingzhou, she says you're a used man.

223
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,300
- Calm down. 
 - That's outrageous!

224
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,160
Take it easy.

225
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,680
Mr. Shi, you met Chen Kang yesterday.

226
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,540
Why did you come to Le'an again?

227
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,560
I want to check their R&amp;D progress and calm him down.

228
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,799
Feng Hua made a wrong move yesterday.

229
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,100
It can hurt Mingyu's public image.

230
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,079
You arrived just in time.

231
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,840
I just got the news that they've contacted other investors

232
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,819
including one overseas company.

233
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,359
Chen Kang is a patriot.

234
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,300
Had he wanted foreign investment he wouldn't have waited for so long.

235
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,899
Let's just stick to our original plan.

236
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:49,119
But… Mr. Zhang and Mr. Tian…

237
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,240
That's why we need to remain even calmer.

238
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,400
If we do our job well enough then no criticism can hold water.

239
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:07,179
Cheater! A match made in hell!

240
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,279
Go bankrupt!

241
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,780
A rich uncle?

242
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Wanna get filthy rich overnight?

243
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,899
Then I will interview Shi Yan first to impress him so well.

244
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:41,119
Let's see how he will shut the door in front of your face!

245
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,060
Mr. Shi, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Tian will be present at tomorrow's meeting.

246
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,640
They may… bring up Lieying.

247
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,279
Remind Lieying to give me a solution within today.

248
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,799
As for Mr. Tian and Mr. Zhang,

249
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,319
no matter who's investing in whom,

250
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,279
it all depends on the assessment results,

251
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,859
or people might talk.

252
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,980
Got it.

253
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,231
Are we getting off, Mr. Shi?

254
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:31,980
Excuse me, sir. Can I ask for a favor?

255
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:38,260
My phone is dead.

256
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,079
Can I borrow your power bank?

257
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,079
I don't have one.

258
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,920
Oh, I see…

259
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,720
Can you bring me along?

260
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,300
So that I can charge my phone on the way.

261
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,930
My car isn't for a lady with a boyfriend, Ms. Zheng.

262
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,160
Ms. Zheng.

263
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,230
Mr. Shi.

264
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,010
Actually, I'm here to book an interview.

265
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,680
I wonder if you have time now.

266
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:55,380
If you don't have enough free time,

267
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,756
I can interview you during the ride.

268
00:23:57,756 --> 00:24:00,720
Then you don't need to make time for it.

269
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,227
If I can't finish the story this week I won't make it for the next issue.

270
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,880
It's my private time during my ride.

271
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,145
If you want to schedule an interview, please contact my assistant.

272
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,902
Mr. Shi.

273
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:28,200
- Mr. Shi, she… 
 - Huh?

274
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,239
Should I drop you off so that you can schedule the interview?

275
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:39,580
Ms. Zheng's a bit weird.

276
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:45,179
Last time at Warner Manor, she refused to ride Mr. Shi's car directly.

277
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,301
But today she was asking for a ride.

278
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:50,150
Could it be…

279
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,150
Okay. Got it.

280
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,070
If Zheng Shuyi can't make it in time,

281
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,873
I will use Yuling's work as the headline story.

282
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,522
Yuling, come to my office.

283
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,574
Please come in.

284
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:39,520
What can I do for you?

285
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:43,240
Yuling, how's your story?

286
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,060
Almost done, but I'm still fine tuning it.

287
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,538
Good. Keep proofing.

288
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,044
Okay.

289
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,499
Ms. Yi, Shuyi hasn't yet interviewed Shi Yan.

290
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,799
Did something happen?

291
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,500
The interviewee temporarily changed the interview time. That's normal.

292
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,839
Yuling, you're a well-seasoned journalist.

293
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,880
You should know between your story and the interview with Shi Yan

294
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,537
which is a better story and which should make the headline.

295
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,359
To be honest. You're much more experienced than Zheng Shuyi.

296
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,099
That's why the lead editor wanted you to interview Shi Yan.

297
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:27,160
But as you can see, Shi Yan himself chose Zheng Shuyan's outline.

298
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,559
Maybe as an entrepreneur,

299
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,037
he tends to give young people more opportunities.

300
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:33,480
So here we are.

301
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,859
You should take care to pick better topics in the future

302
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:38,400
rather than lingering on this interview.

303
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,699
Got it, Ms. Yi.

304
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,980
I'm just worried she won't make it for the next issue.

305
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,900
I don't mean anything else.

306
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,200
What I like most is your eyes on the whole picture.

307
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,359
Keep proofing your draft.

308
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,279
If Zheng Shuyi can't interview Shi Yan in time,

309
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,439
we'll have to use your story.

310
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,079
Sure.

311
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,839
- Thank you. 
 - I'm returning to work then.

312
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,000
Ms. xu.

313
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,219
Okay, got it.

314
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:29,295
Ms. Zheng Shuyi, I regret to tell you that

315
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:31,232
Shi Yan does have a niece.

316
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,079
And his rumored brother-in-law, a Mr. Qin, is Mingyu Group's general manager.

317
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,300
And his rumored brother-in-law, a Mr. Qin, is Mingyu Group's general manager.

318
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,720
- Rumored? 
 - Yep.

319
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,900
His family's full of stories.

320
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,709
And you can only hear them in rumors.

321
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,239
You must've heard it. Mingyu had a huge crisis a couple of years ago.

322
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,680
They almost went bankrupt.

323
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,200
When everyone was trying to salvage it,

324
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,759
Shi Yan left and opened his own company.

325
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,480
And it still goes by the name "Mingyu."

326
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,670
Do you and Kong Nan sneak under their beds?

327
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,580
Where did you get all the details?

328
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,839
And Shi Yan's sister's super mysterious.

329
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,319
Some say she's overseas.

330
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:19,051
Some say she's dead. And some even say she's a star.

331
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:20,599
All sorts of rumors.

332
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,860
But the Shis have never officially published any information about her.

333
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,055
They are so private and they've got strict rules.

334
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,800
And since Shi Yan left, they avoid the press even more.

335
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,899
I see.

336
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:37,760
No wonder I failed to recognize Shi Yan two times.

337
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,019
So Shi Yan is that love wrecker's uncle.

338
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:46,960
Quite a coincidence.

339
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,780
 This is bad! 

340
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,799
 Xu Yuling just talked to the chief editor. 

341
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,599
 Are you going to lose the opportunity? 

342
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,039
 You must interview Shi Yan this week. 

343
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,279
Honestly, I feel bad for you.

344
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,700
But you don't need sympathy now. What you need is rationalization.

345
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,039
You first refused Shi Yan when he approached you.

346
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,039
Now, it's you going back and ask him for a favor.

347
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,720
How are you going to explain this to him?

348
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,839
Can I not explain?

349
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:28,039
Sure. Just don’t appear in front of him again.

350
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:33,639
 Then how about my interview? 

351
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,820
Where do you plan to put Financial Introduce's interview?

352
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,519
You're fully booked this week.

353
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,279
The most recent slot is next week.

354
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,400
Ms. Zheng probably won't make it.

355
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,720
Then book the earliest slot.

356
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,279
The earliest is next Monday.

357
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:05,736
Mr. Chen, is Mr. Shi available today for my interview?

358
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,920
 He's too busy with the meetings to even eat. 

359
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,599
Sorry, he doesn't have time.

360
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,200
Mr. Chen, how about the lunch break?

361
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,899
Can he make just a few minutes? Please!

362
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,559
 I'm sorry, Ms. Zheng. 

363
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,480
 He''ll be working until late into the night. 

364
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,664
How about the weekend? I can work overtime.

365
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,000
 I'm sorry, Ms. Zheng. 

366
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:51,262
 Looking Forward! 

367
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,000
 Before I can interview Shi Yan at Mingyu Cloud Innovation, 

368
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,440
 he's already going to work there. 

369
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,960
 That's why you need to move faster. 

370
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,139
Rise to the challenge.

371
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:20,799
Interview him. Impress him.

372
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,620
Don't worry. I can do it.

373
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:47,423
Mr. Shi, this is Mingyu Cloud Innovation's financial statement for Q3.

374
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:52,480
You've been working overtime since you returned from Le'an.

375
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
You'll want to take a break this weekend.

376
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,880
The next meeting's going to be grueling too.

377
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,300
Don't worry.

378
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,500
This is going to happen sooner or later. I prefer sooner.

379
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,500
It's better to show our cards and see their reactions than waste time.

380
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
You're right.

381
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,599
I'm more worried about your father, the chairman of the board.

382
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,480
Mr. Tian and the rest are veterans.

383
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
They remained loyal during the crisis a few years ago.

384
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,979
and helped your start up business in the early days.

385
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:23,260
If you're insistent will the chairman…

386
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,832
No, he won't.

387
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:27,777
What a relief.

388
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,659
But he won't help me either.

389
00:32:42,013 --> 00:32:45,900
Mr. Qiu, please brief us on Cloud Innovation's third quarter performance.

390
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,659
Sure.

391
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:51,239
Our general assets in Q3 grew 11% compared to Q2.

392
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:54,559
The growth rate in Q4 is estimated to be 20%.

393
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,699
In general, we are doing rather well this year.

394
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,899
 - Nice job. 
 - Well done. 

395
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,100
 Well done. 

396
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,440
We didn't support you in vain.

397
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,559
I believe once we acquire Lieying,

398
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,600
the figure can go even higher.

399
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,839
Didn't Director Feng inform you that

400
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,659
Lieying Group hasn't updated the solution to the critical problem.

401
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:22,640
In other words, Lieying is more like a broker.

402
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,160
Once their funding runs dry,

403
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,140
without R&amp;D capacity, they'll have serious trouble.

404
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,400
We just started.

405
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,640
It's risky to invest in such a company.

406
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,040
Getting the Guans' support and acquiring Lieying

407
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,720
both are very desirable.

408
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,839
I don't see any problem with it.

409
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,640
I had a discussion with Guan Ji.

410
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,920
In addition to making profits, there's also corporate social responsibility.

411
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,819
Companies like Lieying, they have more choices.

412
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,080
But many young people are willing to do meaningful things for society.

413
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,880
They need us more.

414
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,270
So if we win over the Guans' support,

415
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,763
I want to contribute to Could Innovation's future strategies.

416
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:04,939
Speaking of the future, the company was founded three years ago.

417
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:06,722
But we're not yet well known.

418
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:09,640
Our image is important to our long-term development.

419
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,300
We must put emphasis on it.

420
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,780
There have been many rumors and guesses about Mingyu and Cloud Innovation out there.

421
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:21,800
At an appropriate time, you can give some clarifications.

422
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,900
Since we're collaborating with the Guans, you should make an announcement

423
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,840
so that everyone can see the resources we have.

424
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,139
Mr. Li is right.

425
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,580
It's time to show our strength.

426
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,339
But if we can't achieve anything with the collaboration,

427
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:40,440
then the announcement will be meaningless.

428
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,820
But if we make solid achievements, the public won't ignore it.

429
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,140
Shi Yan, we have some suggestions for you that you should take seriously.

430
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,731
Otherwise, it would bode ill for the company.

431
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:57,340
You're right.

432
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,819
Now we have the financial statements of the past three years.

433
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:01,920
And we're about to collaborate with the Guans.

434
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,940
That gives me confidence to be interviewed by Financial Introduce.

435
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Mr. Shi, you haven't eaten.

436
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,118
Grab some food.

437
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,640
Thank you.

438
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,219
What's the remaining plans this week?

439
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,739
We've finished everything ahead of schedule.

440
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:29,267
Can we start working on something planned for next week?

441
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:32,119
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang won't be back until next week,

442
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,142
so we can't make an appointment with them for dinner in advance.

443
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:44,019
- Didn't I say during the meet… 
 - Ah, how about Financial Introduce's interview?

444
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,890
Sure.

445
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,119
What's Ms. Zheng texting you for?

446
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,700
She keeps asking if you'll be available tomorrow. Saying she can work overtime.

447
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:12,980
Tomorrow afternoon I'll go horse riding with Uncle Guan.

448
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,719
I'm available from lunch break until before departure.

449
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,940
Got it. I'll inform her.

450
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,538
- Sister Yuling. 
 - Thank you.

451
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,360
Nannan,

452
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,559
are you working on Lieying Group's story?

453
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:00,419
I heard from you that according to an insider,

454
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,199
Cloud Innovation wanted to invest in them?

455
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,280
Yep, their PR said so.

456
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,781
What is it?

457
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:08,380
Nothing.

458
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,920
 How strange. 

459
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,880
 They're not likely to invest in two similar companies. 

460
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,239
 They're not likely to invest in two similar companies. 

461
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,033
I'm clocking out.

462
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,059
Tomorrow is Saturday.

463
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:24,920
If you still can't interview Shi Yan.

464
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,139
Then I'll wait for him on the first floor of his company.

465
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,519
    
  Mr. Shi will be available tomorrow from 1:00 - 3:00 p.m. 

466
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,239
 Can you come over? 

467
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,960
 Sure, see you tomorrow. 

468
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,200
 Thank you, Mr. Chen. 

469
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,000
Tomorrow, at 1:00 p.m!

470
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,619
Congrats! You finally nailed it.

471
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:55,740
Let's celebrate after the interview.

472
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,400
Definitely! I will tell the chief editor.

473
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,559
Okay. I'll get going then.

474
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,368
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

475
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
 That one, that one. 

476
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,539
 The black bodycon dress will do. 

477
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:48,180
It shows your nice curves.

478
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,680
 This one? Are you sure? 

479
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,499
With this, I can't even hold my laptop properly.

480
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,939
Feels weird for an interview.

481
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:59,137
You were mentally depressed by Yue Xingzhou.

482
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:02,779
 He always tells you that appearance's not important for a girl 

483
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:04,600
 and only your heart matters. 

484
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,979
Then you always dress like a widow.

485
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:11,220
 I think he knew he was not good enough for you. 

486
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,400
 That's why he kept gaslighting you. 

487
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,880
Don't bring him up now.

488
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,480
Okay, okay. I won't mention him.

489
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:24,419
An interview is the same as my job in front of the camera.

490
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:27,239
 When you sit in front of him looking terrible, 

491
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,559
 he might refuse to be interviewed for not wanting to look at you. 

492
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,619
That makes sense.

493
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:39,220
Looking pleasant and excelling at work come in a pair.

494
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,520
So take my advice.

495
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,690
For the interview tomorrow,

496
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,610
you must be both elegant and charismatic.

497
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:55,099
This way his eyes and attention will be fixed on you all the time.

498
00:39:55,099 --> 00:40:00,940
 Then you'll have the chance to ask about every aspect of his life and his aspirations. 

499
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:06,276
Zheng Shuyi, are you Cleopatra?

500
00:40:06,276 --> 00:40:09,979
I just want him to look at you,

501
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:13,980
not for you to bewitch him and stop the interview for good.

502
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
You're exaggerating.

503
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,700
 Give it a try. 

504
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,680
Believe me. However successful he is, he is a man.

505
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,719
And all men fall for this.

506
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,979
Got it.

507
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:34,719
But I've got work to do. Bye.

508
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:42,015
   

509
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:03,462
 Mr. Shi, tomorrow's interview is from 1:00 - 3:00 p.m. 

510
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:19,494
   

511
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,136

 "Passerby" - Zhou Shen 

514
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,179
♫  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  ♫

515
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:50,951
♫  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  ♫

516
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:58,008
♫  Can a happy ending be fixed?  ♫

517
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,579
♫  Meeting you, approaching you  ♫

518
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,567
♫  Falling in love with you, losing you  ♫

519
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:13,194
♫  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  ♫

520
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:19,486
♫  Let the tears struggle and fall  ♫

521
00:43:19,486 --> 00:43:26,276
♫  Are you just a passerby from now on?  ♫

522
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:31,233
♫  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  ♫

523
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,807
♫  Does it hurt  ♫

524
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:40,030
♫  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  ♫

525
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:46,456
♫  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  ♫

526
00:43:47,214 --> 00:43:56,170
♫  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  ♫

527
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:09,037
♫  Do you want to let go like this?  ♫

528
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:11,369
♫  Does it hurt  ♫

529
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:17,585
♫  We're clearly already trapped in quicksand  ♫

530
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:25,093
♫  Don't say you were never afraid  ♫

531
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:30,365
♫  Don't say you can let go  ♫

532
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:36,271
♫  Don't go far, okay?  ♫
