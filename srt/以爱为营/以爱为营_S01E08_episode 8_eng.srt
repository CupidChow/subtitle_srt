00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,000
♫  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  ♫

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,525
♫  Dreams in winter are too fragile  ♫

4
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,575
♫  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  ♫

5
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,200
♫  Intoxicated under the sunset  ♫

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,625
♫  The light fades through my fingertips  ♫

7
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,325
♫  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  ♫

8
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,511
♫  Let time no longer be boring  ♫

9
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:54,050
♫  The evening breeze blows gently  ♫

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,125
♫  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  ♫

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,300
♫  A sip of summer intoxication  ♫

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,525
♫  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  ♫

13
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:06,450
♫  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  ♫

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,585
♫  Stop frowning  ♫

15
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,945
♫  Oh, you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  ♫

16
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,300
♫  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  ♫

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,150
♫  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  ♫

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,475
♫  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  ♫

19
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:36,025
   

20
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,011
   

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,996
And now let's give a big welcome to our distinguished guests.

22
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:46,530
   

23
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,339
We're honored to have you here.

24
00:01:55,339 --> 00:02:00,000
In the future, Guan Group will remain committed to innovation and talent.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,720
This year, we also hired new blood.

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,419
Now, let's give a big welcome to our new partner.

27
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,900
Professor Yu You, the Strategic Adviser of the Group.

28
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:23,687
   

29
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,320
Hello, I'm Yu You.

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,560
It's an honor to join Guan Capital

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
and witness its breakthrough.

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
Similar people hang out together.

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,219
Excellent men come in packs.

34
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:45,920
Yu You looks handsome and young.

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,039
He's pretty good.

36
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,840
Is he better than Guan Ji?

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,599
Well, I can't compare them.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,500
What about you? Is Shi Yan better than both of them?

39
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,960
Shi Yan is… like an unreasonable and annoying little goblin.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,159
In that sense no one can compare to him.

41
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,919
 Why do I suddenly feel so cold? 

42
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,000
 The Guans are taking bigger strides. 

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,759
 Yeah, they are. 

44
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,740
He's also from our Planning Department.

45
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,719
Nice meet you.

46
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,700
We'll be counting on you.

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,900
   

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,839
Excuse me for a moment.

49
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,680
Hello, Ms. Zheng. It's good to see you again.

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,340
Hello.

51
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,940
I almost missed this occasion.

52
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,439
Why? Pray tell.

53
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,980
I'm a little embarrassed to say this.

54
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,700
There was a slight hiccup. I lost the invitation you gave me.

55
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,080
My coworker then found me another one.

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,160
I see. You could've contacted me.

57
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,519
By the way, do you want a separate interview?

58
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,879
Maybe I can help when he's done.

59
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,079
Thank you. My coworkers did an interview last week.

60
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,360
Shuyi.

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,460
This is my friend.

62
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Sanjiang Entertainment Buzz's on-camera reporter, Bi Ruoshan.

63
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,260
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Professor Yu. I've heard a lot about you.

64
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,299
I'm flattered.

65
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:41,199
I'd like to introduce you to two friends of mine.

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
Unfortunately, one of them just left.

67
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,240
 Is the one who just left… 

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,000
Guan Ji?

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,520
My apologies.

70
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,760
This is the journalist I told you about. Ms. Zheng from Financial Introduce.

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,839
Nice to meet you, Ms. Zheng.

72
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,940
And this charming lady is?

73
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,555
Bi Ruoshan, Sanjiang Entertainment Buzz.

74
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,600
Journalists nowadays are indeed all very charming.

75
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,639
Mr. Guan, are you available for an exclusive interview?

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Sure.

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
That's Guan Ji for you.

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,739
He gets talkative around charming ladies.

79
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:48,839
Shanshan is similar, getting talkative when handsome men are around.

80
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,795
   

81
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,745
Excuse me, I have to take this.

82
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,281
Hey, Mom.

83
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:05,079
Didn't I tell you I just got back and I'm trying to get settled.

84
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,700
Okay, I'll do as you asked. Don't worry.

85
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,279
Okay, I'll get back to work.

86
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,979
I feel you.

87
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,539
When I visited you, my mom said she wanted to introduce me to her colleague's son.

88
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,660
My mom wants to introduce me to her old friend's daughter.

89
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,859
Professor Yu, we need you to go early and prepare for the dinner tonight.

90
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:31,920
Okay. Thank you.

91
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,660
Well, if you'll excuse me.

92
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,460
Go ahead. Let's schedule the interview later.

93
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,800
Sure.

94
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,209
Staying for the dinner?

95
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:02,600
I have an article to write. I won’t accompany you anymore.

96
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,120
 It's an honor to join Guan Capital 

97
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,519
 and witness its breakthrough. 

98
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,460
Yu You's voice is pretty nice.

99
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,639
Gentle and charming.

100
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,199
I just wonder if he's good looking.

101
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,739
 It wouldn't be a coincident that he heard me mocking him? 

102
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,241
   

103
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,720
Since he never replies to my serious messages.

104
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,339
Then I have to resort to fun stuff.

105
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,059
 I got a letter today. 

106
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:22,600
 It's an honor to meet you. 

107
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:30,419
 I read a book today. 

108
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,599
 It's called "I'm lost since I met you". 

109
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,639
 That's not going to work. 

110
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,559
 Come on, let's drink. 

111
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,443
 Congratulations. 

112
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,926
This way, please.

113
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,740
Thanks a lot.

114
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,479
I can't claim the credit.

115
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,960
It's because you and Bruce got along well.

116
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,440
You impressed him with your plans and challenges.

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,399
That's why he's joining Le'an.

118
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,220
 I got a letter today. 

119
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,159
 It's an honor to meet you. 

120
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,139
 I read a book today. 

121
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,320
 It's called "I'm lost since I met you". 

122
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,879
What are you laughing at?

123
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,340
You've been acting really weird lately.

124
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,879
I'm curious. Why did you suddenly disappear this afternoon

125
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,720
in the middle of the press conference?

126
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,299
Maybe because I'm unreasonable.

127
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,580
Since you won't read it anyway, I'll text whatever I want.

128
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,579
 Why don't you text me back? 

129
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:10,719
 Your phone's out of order, or you're working on some billions worth project? 

130
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,079
I won't blame you for not replying.

131
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,759
Because you're an illiterate who can't type.

132
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,259
Illiterates can't read messages, either.

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,159
I haven't had a chance to ask you yet.

134
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,919
Is your friend from the media here?

135
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,879
Yes. I just introduced her to you.

136
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,619
The journalist, Ms. Zheng Shuyi.

137
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,799
Are you two seeing each other?

138
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,480
We are just good friends and we get along well.

139
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,779
Professor Yu.

140
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,099
Come on, a toast.

141
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,840
 That's what unreasonable little goblins do. 

142
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:05,220
I'm doomed. He definitely heard everything.

143
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,359
   

144
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,020
What are you looking at?

145
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,294
I'm looking at…

146
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,892
I'm looking at you who's different today.

147
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,360
You're different at work.

148
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,960
You were different today, too.

149
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,919
There was a different kind of beauty.

150
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,639
You're such a sweet talker.

151
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:30,000
These heartfelt words are only for the most dazzling reporter in the city.

152
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
We haven't had enough fun today.

153
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,440
Let's have another round of drinks.

154
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:43,879
Sure.

155
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:58,279
This is the place.

156
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,519
You still remember.

157
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,999
Of course.

158
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,320
It's easy to tell we're the same.

159
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,579
 Hi, Gorgeous. Are you alone? 

160
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,880
 Let's have a drink together. It's on me. 

161
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,679
 You want to buy me a drink? 

162
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,559
 I don't drink normal wine. 

163
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,159
 This is my precious collection. 

164
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,420
 It's one of a kind in the world. 

165
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,260
 Ordinary people can never dream of having it. 

166
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,500
 Hello. 

167
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,320
 Get me a bottle of that wine. 

168
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,059
 A moment please. 

169
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,399
 Excuse me. 

170
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,399
 I'd like to ask how much this wine costs. 

171
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,919
 Since it's one of a kind in the world, I fear I may not be able to afford it. 

172
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,440
 580 yuan. 

173
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,679
 What a relief. 

174
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,759
 I don't need others to buy me the drinksince it costs only 580yuan. 

175
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,619
 So, I'm worth only 580 yuan divided by 10. 

176
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,519
 That's 58 yuan. 

177
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,899
The memories we share are so beautiful and intoxicating.

178
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,360
Maybe you're really drunk.

179
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,919
 - Good morning! 
 - Good morning! 

180
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,459
Shuyi, the schedule for Cloud Innovation's annual conference is out.

181
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,799
They sent you an invitation, didn't they?

182
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:32,324
    
    

183
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,659
There really is a leak in the house and it rained all night.

184
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,780
The schedule just came out today.

185
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,440
Invitations won't come so fast.

186
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
Besides, the interview with Shi Yan was well received.

187
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,260
I'm sure he'll send you an invitation.

188
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,319
 Shi Yan must still be mad now. 

189
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,400
 Our magazine has two more issues this year. 

190
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,259
 Going over each company's year-end conference 

191
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,440
 is definitely a great choice for the headlines. 

192
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,820
 I have to go, whether he's mad or not. 

193
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,920
We've added a session for Le'an and invited Mr. Chen.

194
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,979
Is there anything else you want to change?

195
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,400
Looks fine. Go ahead with it.

196
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,039
Got it.

197
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,859
 Mr. Shi, see you next week. 

198
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,279
Wait a minute!

199
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,780
What about the press?

200
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,699
Mr. Shi, as usual, we included everyone.

201
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:55,699
We also added new agencies.

202
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:59,400
I've confirmed the list. Financial Introduce is there.

203
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:07,240
I'll go over the arrangement again.

204
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
Express delivery from Cloud Innovation.

205
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,660
 The invitation's have arrived. 

206
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,700
 Shi Yan isn't so mean after all. He just likes to act. 

207
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,079
 Then I'll forgive him. 

208
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,179
 I will thank him properly at the press conference. 

209
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,919
 And invite him for a dinner. 

210
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,620
Yuling, this delivery's for you.

211
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,259
For me?

212
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,039
Thank you.

213
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,119
Beier, hurry up and gather Cloud Innovation's material.

214
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,820
Send it to me as soon as you can.

215
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,599
Yes, Yuling.

216
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:57,039
We're going to be very busy.

217
00:19:57,626 --> 00:20:00,039
What's going on?

218
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,640
It’s not the lead editor, right?

219
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,820
 My uncle does care for me. 

220
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,740
 But it's a bit too much, isn't it? 

221
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,500
Why haven't you spoken yet?

222
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,459
   

223
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,599
Before, I was still worried about the lead editor.

224
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,720
Now, you and Yu Ling will each cover one of the Guan Group and Cloud Innovation's conferences.

225
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,913
Somehow we no longer have to worry.

226
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,219
It's my problem. I didn't handle it well.

227
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,100
It's over for me now.

228
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,960
What is over?

229
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,000
It's just a press conference.

230
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,739
You have done so many front pages this year and you have already done well.

231
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,359
Take advantage of this time to unwind.

232
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,839
Prepare the next plan of attack and fight again next year.

233
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,759
I want to do a feature on Cloud Innovation.

234
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,459
I have to go to this conference.

235
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:07,419
I want to publish it on our e-version and make it a special series.

236
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:10,359
Even if you went to the conference and convinced Shi Yan,

237
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:14,659
it's still a long way to go for the e-version's upgrade.

238
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:16,840
I know.

239
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,319
I can't persuade the lead editor right now.

240
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,219
So I have to take every opportunity.

241
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:23,899
And shorten my time spent on that "long way to go."

242
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,720
Then go for it.

243
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:31,360
By the way, bring Shiyue along if you go.

244
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,740
Bring her along?

245
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,140
I'm not sure if I'll be allowed in.

246
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,300
How can I bring her along?

247
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,899
You can always charm your way in.

248
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,279
Please ask someone else to bring her along?

249
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,680
I'm afraid I can't help.

250
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,580
I don't get why a rich kid like her wants to toil in a news agency.

251
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,659
Why doesn't she stay home to enjoy something she likes?

252
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,980
Don't you think Shiyue's very pure-minded?

253
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,540
Not only is she simple-minded, she also has an empty head.

254
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,901
Ms. Yi, I can't be her mentor.

255
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:11,581
   

256
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,599
Don't you like pure-minded people? Or do you prefer sly ones?

257
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,580
Virtues come before competences.

258
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,019
Shiyue does have many shortcomings.

259
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:25,019
But I believe she can be taught well.

260
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,580
You have to trust me.

261
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,100
Take care of her well and be a patient mentor.

262
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,319
Consider it as if I owe you a favor.

263
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,299
Shiyue, Cloud Innovation's press conference is around the corner.

264
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,480
Do some research and come to the conference with me.

265
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:57,100
Shuyi, I thought you didn't receive the invite.

266
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,460
You don't have to worry about that.

267
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,180
But Shuyi I haven't gone over the recording you gave me…

268
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,780
That's for you to familiarize yourself with the workflow

269
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,480
and deepen your understanding of the industry.

270
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,400
This year, Cloud Innovation is the hot topic of the industry.

271
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,380
Financial journalists are dying to be invited to the press conference.

272
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,419
Shi Yan's sharp-minded and his understanding of the market is spot on.

273
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,780
Previously, you just listened to his interview recording.

274
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,839
This time you can meet him in person.

275
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,759
The chief editor is partial.

276
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,960
She's probably comforting her.

277
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,440
But the invite from the chief editor is different from Shi Yan's invite.

278
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
Go back to work.

279
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:58,504
   

280
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,096
Yu You, someone texted you.

281
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,200
Shi Yan, do you have a spare invite for news agencies?

282
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,079
What is it? Is it for Ms. Zheng again?

283
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,279
Yes. How do you know?

284
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,380
I've just returned home and she's the only journalist I know.

285
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,440
It's so nice of you to get her an invite.

286
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,340
Be honest.

287
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,440
Are you pursuing her? Or is it the other way round?

288
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,440
No, we're just friends.

289
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,480
We're from the same city and school and we get along.

290
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,739
Besides, isn't it normal for a senior to help his former schoolmate out?

291
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:28,079
Not everyone's like you going after ladies and trying to impress them.

292
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:34,680
I remember that she interviewed you a while ago.

293
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,639
You didn't give her an invite?

294
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,480
Anyway, do you have a spare invite?

295
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,400
No, I don't.

296
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,580
If you beat me, you might get one.

297
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,200
We've worked all day.

298
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,540
I thought we were here to relax.

299
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,320
But I'm actually here to be your sandbag.

300
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,540
I say. Why are you so eager to win after getting off work?

301
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:17,722
Another round.

302
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:20,082
   

303
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:26,459
Shi Yan wouldn't deliberately withdraw my invite.

304
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:31,359
He's too important to go over trivialities like media invitations.

305
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,319
There must be some misunderstanding.

306
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,840
It's no use thinking on my own.

307
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,019
Why don't I just call and ask him?

308
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,140
If it's a misunderstanding, I'll ask him for an invite.

309
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,840
If he's still mad at me, I'll apologize and calm him.

310
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,559
 I'm sorry I lost to Shi Yan. 

311
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,580
 I can't help you with the invite. 

312
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,899
So he's deliberate!

313
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,340
 Shanshan, 

314
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,359
 I'm done for. 

315
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:16,860
 Cloud Innovation's conference's drawing is near. 

316
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,939
 Shi Yan himself gave Xu Yuling an invite. 

317
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:23,740
 Shi Yan himself, on purpose? 

318
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,939
 And he left me out. 

319
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,540
 He heard my mockery. 

320
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,459
 He's mad at me now. 

321
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,599
 Is that what you're talking about? 
   

322
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,519
 You're deliberately making me jealous, aren't you? 

323
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,619
 I envy you. 

324
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:46,980
 Take it easy. 

325
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,320
 I'll check with my friend. Let's see if I can get one for you. 

326
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,914
 That's great, Shanshan! Thank you, you're my benefactor. 

327
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:59,440
 I can't help. I can't defeat him. 

328
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,545
Defeat him?

329
00:28:11,915 --> 00:28:14,679
My friend can't help.

330
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:17,859
Shi Yan is so mean, isn't he?

331
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,640
You're right.

332
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:24,000
Forget it. I'll sneak in after you.

333
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,680
Were he more generous, I wouldn't have to act like a thief.

334
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,800
I told you that he cares about you.

335
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,380
And that's why he gives you a hard time.

336
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,179
The more he doesn't want me to go, the more I'll try to get in.

337
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,519
 I lost the bet. 

338
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,179
 I think it's a pity, though. 

339
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,060
 Ms. Zheng is a very good journalist. 

340
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,459
 Her articles are also very insightful. 

341
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,380
 I can't help out this time. 

342
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,859
 I hope she won't blame me. She will blame you. 

343
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,740
Hello.

344
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,559
Have you sent out all the invites for the press conference?

345
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,859
 Yes, sir. They were all delivered this morning. 

346
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,179
 Hello, Mr. Shi? 

347
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:55,559
 We received attendance confirmations from Financial Introduce and Jiang TV Station. 

348
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,000
It's not a misunderstanding, is it?

349
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,899
It is all the more reason to ask him in person.

350
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,740
Why scream like a ghost late at night?

351
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:37,540
Screaming like a ghost?

352
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,359
You're sitting here in the middle of the night with no lights on.

353
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,440
You're more like a ghost.

354
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:46,599
You almost gave your niece a heart attack.

355
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,120
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

356
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,759
Everything's fine. You're not freaked out.

357
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,699
Go back to bed.

358
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,440
Uncle, what's wrong with you?

359
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:07,659
Did you get dumped?

360
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,086
Or is it an outright refusal?

361
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,619
Is it about the lady from last time?

362
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,640
Don't tell me you fell for her while she's not into you.

363
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,979
Qin Shiyue, I'll say it again. Go back to bed.

364
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,659
Okay, Uncle. Good night, Uncle.

365
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,480
   

366
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,697
Sign here.

367
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,240
- Ms. Xu, right? 
 - Yes.

368
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,260
Hello. I'll take you there.

369
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,418
- Okay. Thank you. 
 - This way, please.

370
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,900
Take your seat, please.

371
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,980
So close to the stage.

372
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,160
Financial Introduce is our important partner.

373
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,840
Our boss himself asked us to sit you here.

374
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,319
- Please, sit. 
 - Thank you.

375
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:29,743
   

376
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,600
 This is a nice spot. 

377
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,594
   

378
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,279
Mr. Shi, would you like to take a break in the lounge?

379
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,939
No need.

380
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,610
Mr. Shi, you're here.

381
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,810
We've sat important agencies in the front.

382
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,360
You should put more effort in improving your skill set.

383
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,020
Ugh…

384
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,919
Mr. Chen,

385
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,059
didn't you instruct us to get a proper seat for the lady from Financial Introduce?

386
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,759
Come with me.

387
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,920
- Ms. Xu. My apologies. 
 - Hello.

388
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,140
A colleague in my department made a mistake with your seat.

389
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,060
Please come with me.

390
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,240
This way.

391
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,900
   

392
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:19,517
   

393
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,759
Mr. Shi, it's all properly set.

394
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,560
   

395
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:05,900
Shiyue, you don't have to dress up like this for a press conference.

396
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,380
 Oops, I thought I could go unnoticed in black. 

397
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:17,115
Shuyi.

398
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,099
- It's you. 
 - It's you.

399
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,600
You two know each other?

400
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,320
The conference's about to start. Let's get inside first.

401
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Let's go.

402
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,783
Hello, please sign here.

403
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,419
My apologies.

404
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:51,579
We can only admit two persons per invite.

405
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:53,840
- I… I… 
 - Sister Shuyi.

406
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,760
The press conference is about to start why don't you leave me here and go in first?

407
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,439
Shanshan, you take her inside first. I'll think of something.

408
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:04,540
Shuyi, I don't have to go.

409
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,100
You go inside. I've got an idea.

410
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,840
Don't be too late, then. Let's go.

411
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,880
Shuyi, why don't I wait for you outside?

412
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,239
 He's walking toward me. 

413
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,880
 He came out specifically to find me, right? 

414
00:36:36,683 --> 00:36:39,840
 Oh, no, my uncle has seen me. 

415
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,360
 What's with that strange stare? 

416
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,780
 He won't have me give him a conference recap tonight, will he? 

417
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,279
Shuyi, I'm heading in.

418
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,800
Mr. Shi, what a coincidence.

419
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,239
It's been a long time. Have you been busy lately?

420
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:20,136
   

421
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,200
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

422
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:42,700
Mr. Shi, is Xu Yuling a better interviewer or a better writer?

423
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,200
It's not my job to confirm the press list or issue invitations.

424
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,840
Mr. Shi.

425
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,779
Find her a seat.

426
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,799
Ms. Zheng, please follow me.

427
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,019
His language skills are so poor that he can't even explain properly.

428
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,141
Let’s see what you can say when you take the stage.

429
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:14,241
   

430
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,800
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

431
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,939
You're welcome, Ms. Zheng.

432
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:20,180
This seat was specially arranged for you by Mr. Shi.

433
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,840
It's our PR team's fault that you didn't receive the invite.

434
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,779
Please don't take it personally.

435
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,820
Mr. Chen, I have a small favor to ask.

436
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,939
Please, say.

437
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:33,239
I have two other coworkers.

438
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,920
I was wondering if you could arrange for us to sit together.

439
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,659
No problem.

440
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,719
How did you get in?

441
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,580
And we've got such a good spot.

442
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,460
He arranged it.

443
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:01,380
Then you should thank him properly.

444
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:11,682
   

445
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,785
   

446
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,800
 Are you coming to the conference today? 

447
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,119
 I'm here. 

448
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,759
 Okay. I'll see you later. 

449
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,259
 Are you here? 

450
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,639
 Yes. 

451
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,919
 See you in a while. 

452
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,587
 Sure. 

453
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,579
The setup's too bland.

454
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:59,540
It's his style.

455
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:08,139
I hate press conferences and stuff.

456
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,360
They're boring.

457
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,680
I have to sit through a couple hours of gibberish.

458
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:21,740
Heaven, who can come and save me?

459
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,500
Is it about to start?

460
00:40:36,777 --> 00:40:43,037
   

461
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,780
 Mr. Shi, everyone's already downstairs. 

462
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:35,479
 Mr. Shi, Mr. Shi. Straight A Boss. 

463
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,519
 Today is not a press conference for Mingyu, but a press conference for your personal charms. 

464
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,739
 Although I can't speak at the moment, 

465
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:49,700
 I am already screaming for you in my heart.

The father and son are really good.

480
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,699
By leaving the family corporation, Shi Yan got rid of a burden.

481
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:46,540

♫  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  ♫

486
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:34,100
♫  Can a happy ending be fixed?  ♫

487
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,679
♫  Meeting you, approaching you  ♫

488
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,667
♫  Falling in love with you, losing you  ♫

489
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:48,994
♫  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  ♫

490
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:55,486
♫  Let the tears struggle and fall  ♫

491
00:43:55,486 --> 00:44:02,375
♫  Are you just a passerby from now on?  ♫

492
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:07,533
♫  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  ♫

493
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,917
♫  Does it hurt  ♫

494
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:16,130
♫  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  ♫

495
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:23,256
♫  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  ♫

496
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:32,170
♫  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  ♫

497
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:45,137
♫  Do you want to let go like this?  ♫

498
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:47,551
♫  Does it hurt  ♫

499
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:53,685
♫  We're clearly already trapped in quicksand  ♫

500
00:44:53,685 --> 00:45:01,393
♫  Don't say you were never afraid  ♫

501
00:45:02,507 --> 00:45:07,065
♫  Don't say you can let go  ♫

502
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:12,371
♫  Don't go far, okay?  ♫
