 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,625
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,675
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,825
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:48,325
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,511
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,550
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,585
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,250
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,975
 â™« I love you too much to let you go â™« 

20
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:36,125
   

21
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,111
   

22
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,099
Distinguished guests, sorry for keeping you waiting.

23
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:44,964
I'm Shi Yan.

24
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:54,200
   

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,380
Welcome to Cloud Innovation's press conference.

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,186
Shi Yan is doing well.

27
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,280
Shi Yan and his father are brilliant.

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,540
By leaving the family corporation, Shi Yan got rid of a burden.

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,180
The format of this press conference is clearly the idea of young people.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,039
Yue, are you okay?

31
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,460
I am fine.

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,479
Tell me if you don't feel well.

33
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,874
Are you not used to this?

34
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:28,619
Do you think it's a little dull?

35
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:34,919
I'm a little scared when Mr. Shi always looks at me.

36
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,879
Take it easy. He was looking at me.

37
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,140
 She's confident. 

38
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,740
   

39
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,458
   

40
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,019
This year, Cloud Innovation joined hands with many new friends.

41
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,159
They are from new industries.

42
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,197
They have the spirit of innovation and social responsibility.

43
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,360
We can look forward to it.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,140
Is Shi Yan talking about Le'an?

45
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,380
Mingyu Cloud Innovation invested in some technology companies.

46
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,180
Investing in technology companies is risky.

47
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,439
If successful, the rewards will be high.

48
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,239
Shi Yan is brilliant.

49
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,520
He used the introduction of technical experts to acquire a lot of shares with very little money.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,180
The runaway successor of Mingyu is brilliant.

51
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,160
The younger generation will surpass the older.

52
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:12,008
Ms. Shuyi, I don't feel well.

53
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:13,740
Can I get some fresh air?

54
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,120
Go quickly, donâ€™t go too far.

55
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,580
   

56
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,374
We're halfway through the conference.

57
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:33,159
I will give everyone some time to absorb and digest what we learned in the first half.

58
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,480
Also, try the refreshments we have prepared for you.

59
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,920
See you in the second half for more content.

60
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,700
He's very charming onstage.

61
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:54,979
Mr. Shi.

62
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,372
Hello, Mr. Wang.

63
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,959
Are you a journalist of Financial Introduce?

64
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,521
Yes, you areâ€¦

65
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,279
I am from Jiangcheng Daily.

66
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,020
I was an intern of Financial Introduce.

67
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,756
What a coincidence.

68
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:13,820
The leader of the group was Tang Yi.

69
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,280
Do you know her?

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
She is a chief editor now.

71
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,739
What a pleasure. My name is He Boming, and you?

72
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,620
I am Zheng Shuyi.

73
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,560
May I have your WeChat for further communication?

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,960
Okay.

75
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,720
- You can scan my QR code. 
 - Okay.

76
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:37,744
Miss Zheng Shuyi!

77
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,612
Please come over here.

78
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,499
He asked you to come over.

79
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:47,700
So you guys know each other.

80
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,759
 Shi Yan is jealous. 

81
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,839
 All jealous. 

82
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:06,060
Mr. Shi, what can I do for you?

83
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,739
What do you want from me?

84
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,560
Youâ€¦

85
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,499
Where's the journalist that was next to you?

86
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,599
Where is the journalist you brought?

87
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,820
 He wants to ask me about Qin Shiyue? 

88
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,800
 He was looking at Qin Shiyue. 

89
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,079
You want to meet her?

90
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,200
She went out.

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,399
Do you want me to contact her?

92
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,779
 Don't answer it. 

93
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:14,339
My god. She wants me back now?

94
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,800
Hello, Yue. Where are you?

95
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,220
 I am in the lobby. I am nearby. 

96
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,639
Do you want me to go back?

97
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,362
You don't feel well. You are going back home?

98
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:40,700
I am not.

99
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,420
It's fine. You don't have to come back.

100
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,920
Ms. Shuyi, what are you talking about?

101
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,020
Take care of yourself. Get some good rest. Bye-bye.

102
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,879
Iâ€¦

103
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,119
Mr. Shi, she's gone.

104
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,879
Where did she go?

105
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,820
 It's not your business. 

106
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,519
She didn't feel good and went home.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,139
What's wrong?

108
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,160
 What does it have to do with you? 

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,040
She has CEO phobia.

110
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,839
What?

111
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,380
When she sees big shots like you, she can't breathe.

112
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,380
I am not like her.

113
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,660
When I see you, I am happy, excited, and ecstatic.

114
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,399
Mr. Shi, the second half is about to begin.

115
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,066
Could it be that what I got was a cannon fodder female supporting role script?

116
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,640
What are you doing?

117
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,583
Give me my coffee.

118
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,380
Thank you.

119
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,900
Absolute blue chip stocks.

120
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,740
You wonâ€™t lose no matter what happens.

121
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:20,039
The premise is if I can buy this stock.

122
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,360
Welcome back.

123
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,820
In the second half, I will introduce you to some important partners and friends of Cloud Innovation.

124
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,340
Next, I would like to announce a very important and meaningful news for Cloud Innovation.

125
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,400
Guan Capital is going to officially fund Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

126
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,399
And become an important partner of Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

127
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,840
Let's welcome Yu You, the strategy consultant of Guan Capital

128
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,760
to show you the future of Cloud Innovation and Guan Capital.

129
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:03,739
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

130
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:14,500
Guan Capital is committed to innovation and talent acquisition.

131
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,570
In the future, Guan Capital and Cloud Innovation will focus on technology innovation.

132
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,480
Under the power of the new economy,

133
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,317
the original financial model and the old pattern of interests will be gradually broken.

134
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:30,459
Many companies fall into a stereotype when exploring innovation models.

135
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,560
They can't look beyond the business and the industry itself.

136
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,000
It's him.

137
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,848
 It's an honor to join Guan Capital and witness its breakthrough development.  
    

138
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,119
 Stop it. 

139
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:49,679
 Stop it. You are so blatant. 

140
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,100
Thank you everyone for coming.

141
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,160
I hope Mingyu Cloud Innovation and Guan Capital

142
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,793
can climb together and write a new chapter.

143
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:16,440
I declare that this conference is over.

144
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:26,188
Mr. Shi, please express your views on the conference.

145
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,982
Mr. Shi, what is Cloud Innovation's future investment direction?

146
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,870
Ms. Shuyi, I have to go.

147
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,977
I still have work to do at the office. See you.

148
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:41,460
Okay.

149
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,579
I am personally very satisfied with this conference.

150
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:52,579
Thank you also to all my friends from the media for coming.

151
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,919
Do you have any questions?

152
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:15,919
- Are you done? 
 - Just ended.

153
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,028
 Ms. Shuyi, who is the man who just spoke on stage? 

154
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:28,699
It was Shi Yan.

155
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:31,120
What's the matter with you?

156
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:35,799
Why did they only see my uncle?

157
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,940
Am I the only one who saw a handsome and elegant speaker?

158
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,720
Qin Shiyue.

159
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:48,980
What ails you?

160
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,840
Nothing.

161
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,179
This is your first conference, but you slacked.

162
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:58,679
Qin Shiyue, what's your problem?

163
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,603
Uncle, please let go of me.

164
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:05,059
I am sorry.

165
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,759
You want to be my assistant, don't you?

166
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,180
I'll never do it again.

167
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,640
I will work hard and not slack off.

168
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,581
Uncle, please forgive me. Okay?

169
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,200
Okay?

170
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,439
 There are so many people around. Shi Yan, you actually hooked up with a woman in broad daylight. 

171
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,259
 How shameless you are. 

172
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,600
 Are you so impatient? 

173
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,939
If you don't want my manager to know who I am, just let me go.

174
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,080
Excuse me, I have to go.

175
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,779
I will invite you to dinner and schedule the interview for next week.

176
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,800
You're horrible. You scared her away.

177
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,960
What did you guys talk about?

178
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,519
She wanted to invite me to dinner and schedule an interview.

179
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,159
He didn't even ask me to stay.

180
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,059
Zheng Shuyi, no matter how good your manuscript is,

181
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,299
it will still be outperformed by interns.

182
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,379
A wise man never falls in love.

183
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,879
 You want me to turn around and talk to you first? 

184
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,559
 Dream on. 

185
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,560
 Shi Yan, don't even think about it. 

186
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,639
What are you doing standing there?

187
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,499
Pray.

188
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,390
I am leaving.

189
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,460
Walk slowly, I wonâ€™t send you away.

190
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,264
I will drive you home.

191
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,000
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

192
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,275
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

193
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,000
â™«  I hear your heart whispering  â™«

194
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,179
Hello, it's you.

195
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,475
Hello.

196
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,850
â™«  The unresolved clouds  â™«

197
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,050
â™«  Are deserted and sweet  â™«

198
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,679
- Are you waiting for the taxi? 
 - Yes.

199
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,959
There are too many people taking taxis. I've been waiting for a long time.

200
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:29,479
â™«  Let flowing breaths fill my memory  â™«

201
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:33,050
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

202
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,400
â™«  No need to ask, I am willing  â™«

203
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,720
I got an extra one. Here you are.

204
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,659
Thank you.

205
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,000
My car has arrived, Iâ€™ll leave first.

206
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,480
- See you. 
 - See you.

207
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,200
 I sent you a text message but you didnâ€™t reply. 

208
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,260
 I give you a rainbow fart and you ignore it. 
 (Gave him praises) 

209
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,980
 Instead you hooked up with a woman who gets nervous when she sees you. 

210
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,868
 Am I not beautiful enough? Am I not trying hard enough? 

211
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,240
 Do CEOs love women who are afraid of them? 

212
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,997
 So tacky. So disgusting. 

213
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:41,039
 What position do I have to blame him? 

214
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,760
 I am clearly pursuing him. And he hasn't promised me anything. 

215
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,780
Eight ups and downs of emotions in one scene.

216
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,319
What?

217
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:58,111
I said it would rain at 8:00 tonight.

218
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,500
Will you hold an umbrella for me?

219
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,880
Hello.

220
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,459
What's going on?

221
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,479
Okay, noted. See you.

222
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:03,525
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

223
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:10,575
â™«  To travel through this long time with you  â™«

224
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:20,075
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

225
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:26,602
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

226
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:30,799
â™«  Intertwined or parallel  â™«

227
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,325
Okay, I got it. See you.

228
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:35,718
â™«  Gathering in the vast sky  â™«

229
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:41,850
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

230
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:50,475
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

231
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:58,150
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

232
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:08,300
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

233
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,079
Why did I fall asleep in your car again?

234
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,720
You must have been waiting for me for a long time.

235
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,179
Why didn't you wake me up?

236
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,759
It's not long.

237
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,300
Are you sour?

238
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:36,460
I mean, if you have time, I'd like to treat you to dinner.

239
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,877
Thank you for driving me home.

240
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,519
Actually, there's something I want to talk to you about.

241
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,260
It's about the feature interview I mentioned to you.

242
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,640
If you want to make an appointment, contact Chen Sheng.

243
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,559
I still have something else to do.

244
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,419
Thank you for driving me home.

245
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,519
I will leave.

246
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,259
 It was such a good atmosphere. 

247
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:30,380
 Why did I talk about the feature interview? 

248
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,279
Let's go.

249
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,500
That's right! Cloud Innovation is in the opposite direction from here.

250
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,979
He's busy. But he drove me home.

251
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:16,921
He had a long day at the conference, but he drove me home.

252
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,319
He is so sweet.

253
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,642
Hello, you're walking your dog.

254
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:26,715
It's a cute dog.

255
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,279
- Who is she? 
 - I don't know her.

256
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,840
Wait!

257
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,459
He just flirted with Qin Shiyue.

258
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:50,001
And he drove me home now. And he held my head all the way.

259
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,920
He wants to date both of us.

260
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,139
I feel pissed off. I feel pissed off.

261
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,488
Forget it.

262
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:14,359
What kind of good person am I?

263
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,380
I also have ulterior motives for him.

264
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,340
Who am I to ask anything of him?

265
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,379
That's right. That's it.

266
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,782
No.

267
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:31,680
Although I have ulterior motives for him,

268
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,000
I donâ€™t flirt with others at the same time.

269
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,580
Emotionally, I am devoted to him. Okay?

270
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,620
   
   
   

271
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,219
Hello? 
  - Do you want to have a drink? 

272
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:38,400
- No. 
  - No. 

273
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,720
- No? 
 - No?

274
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,959
What are you thinking about?

275
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,280
I am thinking that you shouldn't marry a man who is not as good as me.

276
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,439
- Then I will marry you. 
 - Okay.

277
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,480
What are you thinking about?

278
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,359
For people like us who only love freedom,

279
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,039
how can there be a wedding day?

280
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,079
 I don't know how to get in touch with him. 

281
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,739
 I don't think my uncle will help me. 

282
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:54,480
Shi Yan is a stingy pig with big hooves!

283
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
Why do you like to put on airs so much?

284
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,419
You asked me to communicate with Chen Sheng about your time.

285
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,640
 What did my uncle do? 

286
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,319
 Is he going too far? 

287
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,840
Mom, I don't have time to meet your colleague's son.

288
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,119
It's true that I've broken up.

289
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,701
Didn't I tell you that I needed some time off between seasons?

290
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:25,920
All right.

291
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,401
When I am done, I will be all yours. All right?

292
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:32,059
I am at work. I can't talk to you anymore. Bye.

293
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,319
We doubled the sales of our last issue.

294
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,480
You've worked hard.

295
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,200
Keep up the hard work.

296
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,599
Shuyi's interview with Shi Yan received a terrific response.

297
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,319
It's a wonderful interview with sharp points.

298
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:54,799
It also had a good response in the industry.

299
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,240
Congratulations on such a good result, Shuyi.

300
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,599
I hope you will learn from her and keep up the good work.

301
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,519
 Agreed! 

302
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,140
Shuyi, aren't you going to invite everyone to celebrate tonight?

303
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,696
- Right, Shuyi. 
 - Right.

304
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,920
Shuyi, we are talking to you.

305
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,519
What are you doing?

306
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,400
Ms. Yuling, are you talking to me?

307
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,660
I am sorry. I was wearing noise-canceling headphones. I didn't hear you.

308
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,939
I see.

309
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:52,540
Everyone is saying that you are frustrated in love and proud in the workplace.

310
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,039
You wrote such a good article.

311
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,540
Everyone wants you to treat them to dinner.

312
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,859
Okay, choose a great place.

313
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:05,519
Out of the way.

314
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,200
On my first day on the job,

315
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,359
I called her many times but she ignored me.

316
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,460
It turns out that she was wearing headphones.

317
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,319
My god.

318
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,860
I complained to my uncle about it.

319
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,880
And my uncle is making her miserable.

320
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,319
What kind of misunderstanding is this from an ancient romance?

321
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,119
Are you stupid?

322
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,319
Uncle, don't talk to me.

323
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,900
I am thinking.

324
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,960
You can actually think?

325
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,699
I want to ask you something seriously.

326
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:39,100
What if I accidentally and unknowingly

327
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,680
became a villain? What should I do?

328
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Do you have the intelligence to be a villain?

329
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,659
Could you not throw digs at me for a second?

330
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:51,823
Today, I found out that I misunderstood my manager.

331
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:54,720
She didn't mean to ignore me.

332
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
What does that mean?

333
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,839
In short, it was just a misunderstanding.

334
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,720
But I feel embarrassed to apologize to her.

335
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,359
Because she didnâ€™t even know it was me who filed complaints about her to you.

336
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:09,640
Well, Uncle.

337
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,599
You made her miserable.

338
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,315
Why don't you apologize to her?

339
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:22,600
If you were a villain, you were wiped out in the first three minutes.

340
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,450
Help.

341
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,459
I don't want to apologize to her myself.

342
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:33,799
I, Qin Shiyue, am 22.

343
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,680
I have never hurt anyone.

344
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,019
I have never apologized to anyone.

345
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:39,880
It's so embarrassing.

346
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,759
It hurts my pride.

347
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,580
It won't hurt your pride, because you don't have one.

348
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,282
Qin Shiyue, you'd better get it resolved quickly.

349
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:54,640
Otherwise, someone who is forced to be a villain, like me,

350
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,519
may become a real villain against you.

351
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,480
Ms. Nan, do you have Ms. Shuyi's WeChat?

352
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,060
You mean Shi Yan knows Qin Shiyue.

353
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,479
Yes. And he cares about her.

354
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:25,640
This girl is so popular.

355
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,659
No wonder she got you an invitation last time.

356
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,819
She should come from a wealthy family.

357
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:35,699
So she joined your magazine through the back door.

358
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,880
Shi Yan knows her.

359
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,400
Then it all makes sense.

360
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,739
I wonder how well they know each other.

361
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:47,939
So you are now concerned about Shi Yanâ€™s relationship with her.

362
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:50,999
Are you jealous?

363
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,759
Jealous?

364
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,640
I don't think so.

365
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,000
I have a crush on him.

366
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,539
Are you serious? Are you sure?

367
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:04,480
What are you going to do with your feature interview?

368
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,720
People like him are on the cusp of the storm.

369
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,040
If you get together, and you have a work relationship,

370
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,559
there will definitely be a lot of noise saying that you have everything.

371
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,219
And don't you remember the scandals I told you about before?

372
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:18,762
He had an affair with an actress.

373
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:22,559
Now he's flirting with that intern.

374
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,310
If a relationship is not destined to last,

375
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,640
you'd better not get into it.

376
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,440
I know what you are thinking.

377
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,520
In a relationship, you should follow your heart.

378
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:42,360
Are relationships really that simple?

379
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:45,119
Contact her.

380
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,079
No.

381
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
Contact her.

382
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,819
No.

383
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:53,219
Contact her.

384
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,820
No.

385
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,439
Qin Shiyue, if you make any more noise, then you can get out of here!

386
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,980
   
   
   

387
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,639
 Ms. Song, it's been many years since you debuted, and you have held many concerts, 

388
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,340
 what is different about this 25th-anniversary concert? 

389
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,879
 For many years, I take every concert as a new beginning. 

390
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:04,279
But this year I think I want to use my singing to bring all my old friends back to the past

391
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:07,199
and retrieve our beautiful memories.

392
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,782
This year,

393
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:13,499
I hired the world's top sound, dancing, and lighting teams.

394
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:17,553
I hope to remind everyone of the good memories

395
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:19,799
and bring them some new experiences.

396
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,560
We are looking forward to the concert.

397
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:34,358
   
   

398
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:39,179
I almost forgot.

399
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,519
I snapped up the tickets to go to the concert with that hound.

400
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,000
Since he doesn't enjoy food, I will take him to a concert.

401
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,220
He likes Song Lelan.

402
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,379
   

403
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,280
   

404
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,399
   

405
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,317
   

406
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,137
   

407
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:37,528
    
  

408
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,880
 Mr. Shi, you like Song Lelan? 
     

409
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,459
 What a coincidence. I like her too. 

410
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,119
 I have all of her albums. 

411
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,599
 Which of her songs do you like best? 

412
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,900
 My god. 

413
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,819
 Did I go too far? 

414
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:30,220
    
    

415
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,719
SY.

416
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,919
Shi Yan.

417
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,235
He finally accepted my friend request on WeChat.

418
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,800
I won. He responded to me.

419
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,840
He's kind of romantic.

420
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:54,000
The suffix of his WeChat name is loose.

421
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,739
Only visible for three days?

422
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,719
He is mysterious.

423
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,739
It's his style.

424
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,039
   

425
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,500
 Are you going to sleep?

429
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,960
 I just saw this. 

430
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,039
 I am thinking about who to go with. 

431
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:38,599
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

432
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,739
 Are you available tomorrow night? 

433
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,710
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

434
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,136
   

435
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,050
 Let's go together. 

436
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,473
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

437
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:53,373
   

438
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,939
That went so well.

439
00:38:57,939 --> 00:39:00,150
Has he changed?

440
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,000
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

443
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,639
 Ms. Song, it's been many years since you debuted, 

444
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,400
 and you have held many concerts, 

445
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,559
 what is different about this 25th-anniversary concert? 

446
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,039
 Do you want to watch a concert with me? 

447
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,700
 Echo said, "If I don't like you, I won't marry you even if you are a millionaire." 

448
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,455
 If I like you, "I will marry you even if you are a billionaire." 

449
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:02,440
 In a relationship, you should follow your heart. 

450
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,199
 I have free tickets. 

451
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,400
 Do you want to watch it with me? 

452
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,000
 All right, see you then. 

453
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,100
 Are you free for golf tomorrow afternoon?
