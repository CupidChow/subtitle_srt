 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:31,881
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,406
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:38,581
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,081
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:45,606
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:48,206
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,392
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:53,931
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,006
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,281
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:02,706
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:06,506
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:09,566
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:13,026
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:16,381
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:20,081
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:26,256
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:36,006
   

21
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,892
   

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,280
Go back to bed.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,359
Are you sure you don't want to do it again?

24
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,580
I didn't feel anything.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,220
Go back to bed. Good night.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
Uncle!

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,080
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
I'm hereâ€¦ to work.

29
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,240
Work?

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,039
Yes, for the chip conference.

31
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,020
It's such an important industry forum, I must come to learn new knowledge.

32
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,520
Learn new knowledge?

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,419
I thought your agency wasn't invited.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,180
I asked Guan Ji to bring me here.

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,739
Fine. Everyone is here.

36
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,379
That's all? He let me go easily.

37
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,259
Uncle has changed today.

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,560
Why do you feel so passive?

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,919
 My niece is here. Aren't you interested in her? 

40
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,439
 My niece is here. Aren't you interested in her? 

41
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,159
 Do you want to meet her? 

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,019
Qin Lezhi?

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,520
 I'm not ready yet. 

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,158
 I'm here for work. 

45
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:32,950
 Maybe next time. 

46
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:56,879
 I'm here. 2410, Starland hotel. 

47
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,017
   

48
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,667
Didn't you say you didn't like business trips?

49
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:31,719
Why are you here?

50
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm influenced by you who is so hard-working

51
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,839
I'm full of career aspirations now.

52
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,539
I'm going to climb up the career ladder.

53
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,940
The chip conference is such an important reporting opportunity.

54
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,060
I can't miss it.

55
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,419
Good for you.

56
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,639
By the way, did you know that Qin Lezhi is staying at this hotel, too?

57
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,920
What if I run into her?

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,162
There are so many floors in this hotel.

59
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:03,959
It's not that easy to bump into her, is it?

60
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,920
Besides, aren't you here on business?

61
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,240
She's not going to the chip conference, is she?

62
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,940
 Guan Ji, join us and have fun. 

63
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm on a business trip. Maybe next time.

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,900
   

65
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,600
 Bi Ruoshan,  

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,530
 what should I do to stop you from being hot and cold towards me? 

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,294
   

68
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,600
It was a great pleasure talking to you, Mr. Shi.

69
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm clumsy with words.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,079
But if there's a chance. I'd like to work with you or compare notes.

71
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,780
I look forward to it.

72
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,279
I'll leave now.

73
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,680
 I'm done here. 

74
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,560
 I'm coming back now. 

75
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,319
What if he mentions Qin Lezhi again?

76
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,840
I can't see him.

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,521
 I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. 

78
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,680
 It's late. You should go back and get some sleep. 

79
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,260
 Good night. 

80
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,660
Zheng Shuyi! Zheng Shuyi!

81
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,920
You're digging your own grave!

82
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,399
You don't want one?

83
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,279
No.

84
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,839
He must have had a lot to drink today.

85
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,879
The mere mention of wine could make him reel now.

86
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,079
I ran into Yi Yang during the gathering.

87
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,899
Stop it. It's off time.

88
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,879
I'm getting a headache hearing it.

89
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,279
Yi Yang is really young and bold.

90
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,340
He's indeed a dark horse.

91
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:17,624
   

92
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,839
What's wrong, Mr. Shi?

93
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,759
Your thumb is basically glued to your cell phone today?

94
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,120
Who are you messaging?

95
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,340
My girlfriend.

96
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,719
Tell me about her! Who's so bold to take a difficult man like you?

97
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,999
I'll tell you when she wants to go public.

98
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,679
Since you can't say who she is, you can at least tell us about how you got together.

99
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,100
That's right! Tell us about your love story.

100
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,180
Maybe I flirted with the wrong person.

101
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,539
Flirting by mistake?

102
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,320
So who is flirting with whom?

103
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,919
Is the flirting right or wrong?

104
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,759
She flirted with me.

105
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,019
Then she admitted she flirted with the wrong person?

106
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,340
I think she gradually fell in love with me after that.

107
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,280
Such an understatement.

108
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,000
So envious we are.

109
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,700
Don't just interrogate me.

110
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,550
You two should have a richer love life than me. Right?

111
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,120
Well, you could say that to Guan Ji.

112
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,799
But I've got nothing to say as a poor bachelor.

113
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,200
Is that so? Our gentle and knowledgeable Professor Yu is not being pursued?

114
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,919
The suitable one doesn't seem too interested in me.

115
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:51,720
The one who's interested in me is not quite suitable.

116
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
But I've been thinking about it lately.

117
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,840
Relationships are two-way.

118
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,399
So I shouldn't treat it like a math question.

119
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,460
Relationships should be two-way.

120
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,034
Why are you so nosy about love?

121
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:09,499
Why haven't I seen you care so much about other people's emotional lives before?

122
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,039
Why are you looking at me?

123
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,360
I don't have any touching love story to share.

124
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not like you to be so modest.

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,059
Tell me. Who are you frustrated with?

126
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,759
No, I'm not.

127
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,820
Come on, let's drink.

128
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:33,480
â™ª  Love is a torturous thing  â™ª

129
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,480
â™ª  But I can't give it up  â™ª

130
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,360
â™ª  Love is my only secret  â™ª

131
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,820
â™ª  It breaks your heart and fascinates you  â™ª

132
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,419
You'd better take him back.

133
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,859
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

134
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,939
â™ª  Love is the secret of my heart  â™ª

135
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,859
â™ª  It's fascinating  â™ª

136
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,400
It breaks your heart and fascinates youâ€¦

137
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,400
 Good morning, Ms. Zheng.It's 8:00 a.m. 

138
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
 We're here to wake you up. 

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm awake. Thank you.

140
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
I haven't slept well all night.

141
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,000
His niece is the real trouble.

142
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,800
Have you had breakfast?

143
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
Yes, and you?

144
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's go.

145
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,200
 Calm down. I won't run into her. I can do it. 

146
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
 I'm in charge here. 

147
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Oh, by the way. What's your niece doing here?

148
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Is she traveling?

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She said she's here to learn new knowledge at the chip conference.

150
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,200
Why are you asking about her all of a sudden?

151
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm concerned about your family.

152
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,700
 Qin Lezhi is going to the conference. 

153
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,000
 If I bump into her, Shi Yan will find out about my relationship with her. 

154
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Shi Yan will definitely feel that I approached him to get back at Lezhi. 

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
 How can I explain this? 

156
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,000
 I don't think it can be explained at all. 

157
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,700
What's the matter?

158
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,300
Nothing.

159
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,000
Maybe because I didn't sleep well in the new environment.

160
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
Get some rest.

161
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
 I heard you went to Fucheng. 

162
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,400
 Didn't you say you were with your friend? 

163
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,300
 It's over. Bluetooth is automatically connected. 

164
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
 Your friend? 

165
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you have to be so vague about traveling with me?

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,700
No, it's not like that.

167
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,700
I get it.

168
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,000
Can I jump out of the car now? Someone wants to jump out of a car.

169
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
Why don't you go in first?

170
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,800
You're not coming with me?

171
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,200
 I'd love to. 

172
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,300
 But what if I run into Qin Lezhi? 

173
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,300
My friend is here. I'll go find her and greet her.

174
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,200
See you in the lecture hall later.

175
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,100
It's almost time to start. I haven't seen Qin Lezhi yet.

176
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,900
I guess she's not coming.

177
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
- Shiyue. 
 - Shuyi!

178
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Didn't you say you went with your friend?

179
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,920
I'm done.

180
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,600
And I have a friend coming over so I tagged along to learn a thing or two.

181
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
Why are you here?

182
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,000
We have the same reason. I'm here to learn, too.

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,200
Shuyi, what's that look on your face?

184
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Don't you want me to come?

185
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
 Shiyue is here. 

186
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,800
 If we run into Qin Lezhi later, we'll be two against one. I have the advantage. 

187
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,400
 Even if Shi Yan gets involved, she won't take the upper hand. 

188
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
I've missed you so much.

189
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,400
When you get back, write a report and give it to me.

190
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,200
Many semiconductor companies are present at this conference.

191
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,600
Cloud Innovation, Le'an, and Dark Horse all sent representatives.

192
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,200
And many experts in the industry also came.

193
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,200
What are you looking for? Did you hear me?

194
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes, I did.

195
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Shuyi, I'm going to the bathroom. You go in first.

196
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
Professor Yu.

197
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,400
Ms. Qin, what are you doing here?

198
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,600
I came to see you.

199
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,800
I'm a trainee reporter so I wanted to learn more here.

200
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,600
That's why I asked Guan Ji to bring me along.

201
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,500
You know Guan Ji?

202
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,400
Guan Ji brought you here.

203
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,700
We're very good friends.

204
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
What's wrong?

205
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,000
Nothing.

206
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,700
Then go on with your work.

207
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,600
I'll leave you to it.

208
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,400
Why is he so cold all of a sudden?

209
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,800
Shouldn't he like a professionally inquisitive girl?

210
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,680
 - They don't agree. 
 - You, nowâ€¦ 

211
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,600
 They won't let me do it at all. 

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,400
We'll follow up on this.

213
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,800
Okay.

214
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,500
I have something to do over there. I'll talk to you later.

215
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

216
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,900
I'm going to leave now.

217
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,200
Ms. Bi.

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
Anything the matter?

219
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm in the middle of something.

220
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,700
If there's nothing else, I'll have to excuse myself.

221
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,200
What are you doing here?

222
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Come sit with me in the first row.

223
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,800
I was invited by Mr. Shi. I should sit next to Mr. Shi.

224
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:38,913
   

225
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
I need to grab a coffee.

226
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
You want some?

227
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,600
I need to go out. Let's go together.

228
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,340
 Good for you, Shi Yan. 

229
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,000
 You're putting pressure on me now, aren't you? 

230
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm a little dizzy from standing up so suddenly. I'll go later.

231
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,400
Would Americano do?

232
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,100
Yes, thank you.

233
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,500
Wellâ€¦

234
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
What are you trying to say?

235
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,200
That you don't know each other well. That these are all coincidences.

236
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, I definitely don't know him as well as I do you.

237
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,740
Hello. Can you switch places with me?

238
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,000
- Sure. 
 - Thank you.

239
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,820
 If I've done something wrong, let the law punish me. 

240
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,800
 Don't let me face this embarrassing situation! 

241
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
Ms. Zheng.

242
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
Mr. Yi.

243
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
Youâ€¦

244
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,400
Sorry. Someone's sent me a message on WeChat.

245
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
 You're impressive! 

246
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
 You know all these big shots and sit with them. 

247
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,300
 We don't have to worry about interviews in the future! 

248
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,600
 You're the top one in financial journalism. 

249
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 I feel some strong competition among the gentlemen beside you. 

250
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,900
Mr. Shi.

251
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,800
We meet again.

252
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,900
It's quite unexpected.

253
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,000
Large latte with milk and sugar.

254
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,500
- Okay, just a minute. 
 - Thank you.

255
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,400
An iced coffee, please.

256
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Okay, just a minute.

257
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,300
Hello. Four Americanos, to go. Thank you.

258
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,200
Okay. Give me a minute.

259
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,500
Professor Yu.

260
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,200
Can I have one more? Thank you.

261
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
Sure.

262
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,100
Ms. Qin, what a coincidence.

263
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,600
Professor Yu, do you think you're being too polite?

264
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,570
I mean I call you Professor Yu all the time.

265
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,600
That makes us sound like strangers.

266
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,100
Then you can call me Yu You from now on.

267
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,200
Yu You.

268
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,100
But you call me Ms. Qin. It's still a bit awkward.

269
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,700
Let's be fair and you can call me Yue.

270
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,000
Where's Guan Ji?

271
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,600
Guan Ji.

272
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,500
As soon as we got to Fucheng, he left me at the hotel and disappeared.

273
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,700
That's strange.

274
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,200
Does he have something to worry about in Fucheng?

275
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Hello. Your coffee's ready.

276
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,900
Yes, thank you.

277
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,500
I got you an Americano. It's a bit bitter. Is it okay?

278
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,800
Definitely.

279
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,500
I love bitter.

280
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,600
Semiconductor companies and experts are gathering at this chip conference.

281
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,700
The number of exhibitors have reached 300.

282
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,200
There are more than ten industry forums. Its scale is unprecedented.

283
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
And at this chip conference the most popular forum

284
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,500
is the upcoming millimeter wave technology forum.

285
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,800
What's next?

286
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,300
Shanâ€¦

287
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,800
Ms. Bi.

288
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,000
Mr. Guan,

289
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the forum will start soon.

290
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,400
Why don't you go in and take a seat?

291
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,700
Let's go in together.

292
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,300
I have to check my work with my colleagues.

293
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,400
Besides, your seat is in the guest section in the front row.

294
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm in the media section. We can't sit together.

295
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,400
We can. I'll arrange it.

296
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000
You can sit next to me.

297
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,000
It's not appropriate. I'm going to work.

298
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,100
Do you need me to call Guan Ji over for you?

299
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,000
No, no need.

300
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,600
Which row are you sitting in?

301
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,500
 Make sure you get a seat at the back! It must be at the back. 

302
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,300
As far away from my uncle as possible.

303
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,600
I'm in the media area.

304
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm in the first row, a little to the right.

305
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,800
The forum will start soon.

306
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
Why don't you get in there?

307
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,300
Yes.

308
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,800
Qin Shiyue.

309
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,200
Your little trick is stupid!

310
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,900
With the popularization of 5G technology and satellite communications,

311
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,000
more and more people have felt the power of millimeter waves.

312
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,900
Next, let's give the floor to Professor Chen.

313
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,500
   

314
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,900
There is no precise definition of the millimeter wave frequency band.

315
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,490
Usually, waves from 30 to 300 gigahertz

316
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,000
are called millimeter waves.

317
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,600
Its wavelength range is between microwaves and far-infrared waves.

318
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800
Thus, it possesses the characteristics of both waves.

319
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,100
Regarding the theory and technology of millimeter waves,

320
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,000
there is the extension of microwave to high frequencies

321
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,100
and the extension of light waves to low frequencies.

322
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,600
The millimeter wave technology has a wide range of applications.

323
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,800
With the popularization of 5G technology and satellite communication,

324
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,800
more and more people have felt the power of millimeter waves.

325
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 - In additionâ€¦  
 - Phased Array?

326
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,800
Phased array radars are like the eyes of a dragonfly.

327
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,200
There are many small eyes inside each eye.

328
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
They can search, track, and measure targets.

329
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,600
It used to be mainly used in the military industry.

330
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,600
What we're doing now is adapting it for wide use in the civilian market.

331
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,500
Thank you, Mr. Yi.

332
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,300
No problem.

333
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,200
If there's anything you don't understand just mark them.

334
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I can go through them with you.

335
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,600
I used to be a teaching assistant. I more or less know how to teach.

336
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,600
It's all explained in the convention booklet.

337
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,400
Listen carefully. Don't miss the key statements.

338
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,200
 And that leads to higher power consumption. 

339
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,400
 That's all I have to share with you. 

340
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,100
 Thank you for your attention. 

341
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
 Thank you very much, Professor Li. 

342
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,600
 Next, let's give the floor to Ms. Chen from the semiconductor company Guangxin Tech. 

343
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,200
 Welcome. 

344
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,110
 Photonic-assisted millimeter wave phased array chips 

345
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,800
 can link fiber and millimeter waves. 

346
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,200
 In such a system, we usually need to process baseband signals at a centralized location. 

347
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,700
What's wrong with you?

348
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,600
 And use optical fiberâ€¦ 

349
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,400
After this session, I'd like to go back to the hotel.

350
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,800
What's wrong? You don't feel well?

351
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,300
Not really.

352
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Let me know when you get there.

353
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,900
You're going back to the hotel?

354
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,400
I'm also going back to get some things.

355
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,000
 There's another point, I'd like to share with you. 

356
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,800
 I think the data flow directly travels through light waves. 

357
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,200
Ms. Zheng, I'll take you back to the hotel.

358
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,200
Give me your notebook and recorder. Go back and get some rest

359
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,100
 â€¦is suitable for low-power compact radio heads via millimeter wave links. 

360
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,800
 Thank you. 

361
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,600
 At the circuit level, the challenges in millimeter wave phased arrays include 

362
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,400
 electrical routing, dataâ€¦ 

363
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,400
Thank you, Professor Li Xuecai.

364
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,800
Let's take a short break.

365
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,600
See you in the second half.

366
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,700
- I'm going to make a phone call. 
 - Okay.

367
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,200
Mr. Shi.

368
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,400
So, Zheng Shuyi came with you?

369
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
What's wrong with her?

370
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,500
She's not feeling well. So she went back to the hotel.

371
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,800
She's very delicate. She won't be here this afternoon.

372
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,800
Mr. Shi.

373
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Did you send her back? How is she?

374
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,000
I sent her back.

375
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,700
But I saw her take a box of painkillers from the service table.

376
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,200
Painkillers?

377
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
Go to the lunch meeting in my place.

378
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
   

379
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,000
Why me again?

380
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,300
I also want to return to the hotel to video Kong Nan.

381
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
What are you doing here?

382
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,200
If I was not here, did you plan to lie here miserably alone?

383
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,080
 He knows I'm sick. 

384
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,400
 So he came back to see me? 

385
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,200
What's wrong?

386
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,400
I'm in pain.

387
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,900
Where does it hurt?

388
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,600
Everywhere.

389
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,600
Actually, it's not that bad.

390
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,900
Say something nice to me and I'll be fine.

391
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,600
What do you want to hear?

392
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Just ask why you get to see a fairy without entering Heaven?

393
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,400
Go to sleep. I'm right here. Ms. Fairy.

394
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,200
 It seems he's going to stay here. 

395
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 That's good. At least when it hurts too much someone will look after me. 

396
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,500
Do you have a headache or stomachache? Or are you hurting somewhere else?

397
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
Crampsâ€¦

398
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,800
Be careful from now on. Don't wear short skirts.

399
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,200
 Do you know how to comfort people? 

400
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,300
What do you think I'm wearing a short skirt for?

401
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,400
It's for looking good.

402
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,600
You look equally good with something else.

403
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,300
Sleep.

404
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,500
   

405
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,591
   

406
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,759
 She has a pet at home? 

407
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,920
Hey, Mom!

408
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,959
 Shuyi! What are you doing? Why did it take you so long? 

409
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,519
I'm taking a nap.

410
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:33,379
 In the middle of the afternoon? What happened? 

411
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,419
- I'm fine. I'm just sleepy.
  - Everything's fine. 

412
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,000
 Then why don't you go hang out with Yu You. 

413
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,699
Can't I take a break during the weekend?

414
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:45,000
 You should dine out together and go to a movie. That's also relaxing. 

415
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,359
 There's a movie recently. It's a love story or something? 

416
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,359
 Your cousins have all been talking about it. 

417
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,440
 Why don't you two go watch it? 

418
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,160
Mom! Actually, I have aâ€¦

419
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,999
I'll tell you when I get home for the Spring Festival. Okay?

420
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,900
 Why wait for the Spring Festival? 

421
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,840
 If you really don't like him, just tell me. I won't force you. 

422
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,300
Okay, got it. I really don't like him.

423
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,320
 Then tell me. I'll look for another one for you. 

424
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,559
Didn't I send you a picture?

425
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,940
Your mom's urging you to go on a blind date?

426
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,760
No. My mom asked me to pick a dog.

427
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,839
Then, which dog do you like?

428
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,359
I like cute and obedient ones such as Chinese garden dogs.

429
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,459
Zheng Shuyi, you're very good at causing me headaches.

430
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:51,960
I'll give you some painkillers.

431
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,780
Are you going to sleep or not?

432
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,519
I'll sleep.

433
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,390
Don't you have a meeting at 3:00 p.m.?

434
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,900
You go ahead. I'm fine.

435
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,339
Send me a message if you need anything.

436
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm off.

437
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,239
Hello.

438
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,000
 Mr. Shi, Prof. Li Xuecai is in a hurry to leave. 

439
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,440
 Are you coming? 

440
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,659
Got it. I'll be right there.

441
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,500
I'm so hungry.

442
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,219
Shanshan! What are you doing here?

443
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:13,500
I heard you were sick. So I came to see you.

444
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,740
Are you really sick? Or are youâ€¦?

445
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,840
Curb your lewd imagination!

446
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,819
I'm on my period. It hurts so much that I feel faint.

447
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,020
Did you take your painkillers?

448
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,460
They won't all come and see me. Right?

449
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,739
Ms. Zheng, your order has arrived.

450
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,720
I didn't order anything.

451
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,619
Isn't this room 2406?

452
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,779
Yes, thank you.

453
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,079
Mr. Chen, I can feel your sincerity.

454
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,259
Mr. Shi is also very busy.

455
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,179
But if I don't leave now. I won't be able to catch the train.

456
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:10,660
Let's do it another time.

457
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,299
Please wait a little longer. Mr. Shi will be here soon.

458
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:16,219
Later. I can take you to the train station.

459
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,299
Mr. Shi is here.

460
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,840
Prof. Li, hello. I'm Shi Yan.

461
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,139
Hello, Mr. Shi.

462
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:30,659
Sorry to keep you waiting.

463
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,159
I've heard a lot about your work in millimeter wave communications.

464
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,900
I look forward to speaking with you.

465
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,359
I'm flattered.

466
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,060
It's not my work alone.

467
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,119
It's the work of the entire research team.

468
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,580
They gave all the credit to me.

469
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,679
I'm flattered.

470
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,860
Professor. Li, you're too modest

471
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,660
- I heard you're catching the train, right? 
 - Yes, I am.

472
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,479
Why don't I give you a ride?

473
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,113
Thank you very much. Let's talk on the way.

474
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:52,540
Thank you.

475
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:59,492
   

476
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,019
 Thank you, boss. 

477
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:06,159
 Who's your boss? 

478
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,410
   

479
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,819
He's so sweet, isn't he?

480
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:29,519
He's too sweet to be true.

481
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,460
He had someone send me back to the hotel. Then he came back himself.

482
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,939
He stayed with me until I woke up.

483
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:39,420
He's on his way to being a perfect boyfriend.

484
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,020
But the better he treats me, the more uneasy I feel.

485
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,220
I feel bad for what I did.

486
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,599
Shanshan, the day I left for Fucheng, Yue Xingzhou came to see me.

487
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,619
How dare he come to you?

488
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,260
He didn't ask to get back together with you, did he?

489
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,540
Don't be silly.

490
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,300
No, I won't.

491
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,259
It's just that he told me the other day that I approached Shi Yan to get back at him.

492
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:09,480
Even he thinks so.

493
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,800
If Shi Yan finds out about my relationship with his niece,

494
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,519
I'm sure he'll think the same way.

495
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,380
Instead of waiting for his niece to tell him and make him doubt in pain,

496
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,779
I should tell him right now.

497
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:22,860
You can't tell him now.

498
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,400
Think about it.

499
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
You two have only been together for a short period.

500
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,639
You're telling him now you approached him to get back at your ex.

501
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,440
Can he accept that?

502
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,840
He must feel that you're playing him.

503
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,239
Then he'll stop and break up with you.

504
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,100
But the reason why I'm with him is really that I love him.

505
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,880
I believe you.

506
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,079
But now the question is whether Shi Yan believes you.

507
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,020
Can he tolerate your deception?

508
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,500
Is he too deeply in love to let go?

509
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,050
If he finds out and wants to break up with you,

510
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,290
will you be able to accept losing him?

511
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,060
If you break up, what about your e-magazine?

512
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I know the consequences are serious.

513
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,300
But I just don't want to lie to him anymore.

514
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,980
Listen to me. Wait a little longer.

515
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,540
This is not the right time.

516
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:15,119
Wait till he loves you so much that he won't be able to leave you.

517
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,080
Then you can tell him.

518
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,400
How long will that take?

519
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,940
Will there really be such a day?

520
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:30,050
Professor Li, though I'm not a technical expert,

521
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,510
I have the same vision as Le'an's Chen Kang.

522
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,400
That is to make China's own chips.

523
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,320
That's why I invested in Le'an Tech.

524
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,239
Now Le'an Tech is in trouble.

525
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,699
That's why I desperately hope to get your advice and help.

526
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:46,220
I met Chen Kang a few years ago.

527
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,320
The young man was full of vigor.

528
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,179
He led his team to be fully dedicated to technology.

529
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:52,905
It's admirable.

530
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:58,239
So, if I can help him and Le'an Tech, I'll do my best.

531
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,780
Youâ€¦

532
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,540
I thoughtâ€¦

533
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,639
You didn't think I'd be so quick to say yes?

534
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:09,400
A while ago, I read an interview with him.

535
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,239
He's come a long way and it's not easy.

536
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,519
You young people are all very brave.

537
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,100
I believe your wishes will soon be realized.

538
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,059
Thank you for your generosity. Then I'll be frank.

539
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:24,340
Could your laboratory cooperate with Le'an

540
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,159
and solve this technical problem together?

541
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:30,699
To be honest, I'm not very sure.

542
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:34,679
But I can bring my team to Le'an Tech to learn and exchange.

543
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,780
And then we'll see if I can help.

544
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,440
Mr. Shi, what do you think?

545
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,400
Of course, it's great. Thank you, Professor Li.

546
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,519
Chen Kang and I will be waiting for you at Le'an Tech.

547
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay.

548
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,963
Shi Yan,

549
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:05,179
you're so smart.

550
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,785
Why don't you tell me what to do?

551
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,839
Mr. Chen, long time no see.

552
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,119
 It's been a while. 

553
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,599
 How have you been? 

554
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,280
I'm good. How's work?

555
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,580
 I'll be brief. 

556
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,580
 I'm getting married next month. 

557
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,219
Really? So soon?

558
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:29,779
 Not soon at all. 

559
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,339
 I've been dating for two years. 

560
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:33,319
 The wedding is scheduled for the fourth day of the new year. 

561
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:36,580
 - Are you coming?  
 - Yes, of course I'll come.

562
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:40,260
 Oh, by the wayâ€¦  
 - What's wrong?

563
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:46,259
 I noticed from your posts a while ago that you and Yue Xingzhou seem to haveâ€¦ 

564
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:47,800
 I'm not prying. 

565
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,540
 I just thought when we were in college, he and I were quite close. 

566
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,220
 - Soâ€¦  
 - It's okay.

567
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,900
You can invite him. I'm all good with that.

568
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,380
It's between us. It shouldn't affect you.

569
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,619
 Yeah, I know. I called him this morning. 

570
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,900
 But I think his current girlfriend is also coming to the wedding. 

571
