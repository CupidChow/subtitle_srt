 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:32,280
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,605
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:38,680
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,280
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,905
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:48,305
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:50,591
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:54,030
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,105
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,280
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,605
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,505
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,555
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:13,025
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:16,480
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,080
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,255
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:36,005
   

21
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,991
   

22
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,100
   

23
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:06,334
   
   

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,700
To you, I'm not that special, am I?

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,699
Don't drive this car for the time being.

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,639
Shiyue.

27
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,919
Here are the notes from the recent classes.

28
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,960
Thank you, Yucheng.

29
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,060
I'll return them to you as soon as possible.

30
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,040
When will you come back to class?

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,680
You're coming back. Right?

32
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,879
Of course.

33
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,520
I've been a bit busy lately.

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Once I'm done, I'll come back to class.

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,479
So I'll still need to trouble you to lend me notes.

36
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,080
When I come back, I'll treat you to a meal.

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,139
You're treating me to a meal?

38
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,820
Qin Shiyue.

39
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,520
Professor Yu.

40
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,819
Professor Yu.

41
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,280
Professor Yu is really nice.

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Explain to him properly why you haven't been coming to class recently.

43
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,919
I'm going to my next class. Bye.

44
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,080
Goodbye, Professor Yu.

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,659
Bye, Shiyue.

46
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,260
Bye.

47
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,020
Do you have time?

48
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,879
Let's have a meal together.

49
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,519
Sure.

50
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,860
How's the Le'an Tech?

51
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,040
I got in touch with an expert.

52
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,480
We'll see if this can help Le'an Tech.

53
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,680
Work is very important.

54
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,340
But your own matters can't be neglected.

55
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,000
I haven't seen Ms. Zheng for a long time.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,959
How are you two recently?

57
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,939
Bring her to the riding club when you have time.

58
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,859
She probably won't come anymore.

59
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,519
It's very normal for young people to have disagreements.

60
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,399
You should understand each other. Communicate more and be considerate.

61
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,420
I can tell that she cares a lot about you.

62
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
She has a lot of people and things to care about now.

63
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,059
She also has many other choices.

64
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,100
Is that so?

65
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,479
Shi...

66
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,240
Shiyue.

67
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,000
The fish here is particularly good.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,839
And fish is also good for your health.

69
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,639
You can try it.

70
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,020
How is it?

71
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,240
It's delicious.

72
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,939
Thank you.

73
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,639
You suddenly came to school today.

74
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,040
Was there something the matter?

75
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,079
Nothing.

76
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,000
I just came to borrow notes from Yucheng.

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,959
I can send you the class slides.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,319
I might not understand the slides.

79
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,160
Then you can continue to come to class.

80
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,519
I mean... we've been covering primary and secondary markets recently.

81
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,539
Understanding these can help your work.

82
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,560
Anyway, if there's anything you don't understand, you can always ask me.

83
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,279
 Why is he suddenly concerned about me? 

84
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,300
 Is it because I was absent these days and he's realized how important I am? 

85
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,879
 Well, so I shouldn't act like a clingy girl in the future. 

86
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,620
 It's time for some aloofness. 

87
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,120
I was sick the other day.

88
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,720
My family has been very strict with me.

89
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,639
They won't even allow me to go to work.

90
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,639
For the time being, I probably won't be able to come to your classes.

91
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,260
How come you're back so late?

92
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,340
I went out for dinner with a friend.

93
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,960
Uncle,

94
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,820
are you upset?

95
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,120
It's okay, Uncle.

96
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,440
Victory and defeat are common.

97
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,100
You just showed up too late.

98
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,779
Defeat?

99
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
It is all fate.

100
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,200
Resign tomorrow.

101
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,379
You don't need to go to work anymore.

102
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,799
 I just made some progress with Yu You today. 

103
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,659
 If I resign tomorrow, what would Yu You think of me? 

104
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,420
 Maybe I should take a long leave first. 

105
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,500
   
   

106
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,659
Sister Shuyi.

107
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,720
You're back.

108
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,119
May I... take a leave of absence?

109
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,759
Pardon me?

110
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,960
My family is worried about my health.

111
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,139
They want me to stay home and recuperate.

112
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,619
Then you should rest well.

113
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,399
Thank you, Sister Shuyi.

114
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,200
Then I'll also talk to the chief editor.

115
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,559
Shiyue.

116
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,259
What's wrong?

117
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,760
Your uncle,

118
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,460
does he know you're taking a long leave?

119
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,120
It's my uncle who asked me to take leave and rest at home.

120
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,759
Then you should rest well.

121
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,000
Come back soon.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,639
I'm fine. I will recover very soon.

123
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,939
Sister Shuyi, wait for me to come back from rest, I still have a lot to learn from you.

124
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,159
 So, this is all your arrangement. 

125
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,779
 You're keeping people around you away from me. 

126
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:38,224
   
   

127
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,440
Mr. Shi has been in a particularly bad mood lately.

128
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,639
It's because of her, right?

129
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,039
Probably.

130
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:17,159
Since I started working here, I've never seen a woman eat and sleep in Mr. Shi's office.

131
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,459
Then tell me... What exactly is going on between them?

132
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:22,980
I've got no idea.

133
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,979
It looks like... she did something wrong?

134
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,580
Ms. Zheng.

135
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,440
Mr. Chen.

136
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,720
Sorry, Ms. Zheng.

137
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,019
Mr. Shi doesn't have time to see you today.

138
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,619
No worries. I'll come back tomorrow.

139
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:56,899
Mr. Shi also said... that he wants to stop the collaboration between Cloud Innovation and Financial Introduce.

140
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,359
Mr. Chen, could you please arrange a meeting with Mr. Shi for me?

141
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,779
I'd like to speak with him in person.

142
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,600
Sorry.

143
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,980
Mr. Shi said he won't meet with you.

144
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,799
Okay.

145
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,559
Thank you.

146
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:38,137
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

147
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:41,879
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

148
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,499
 Mr. Shi. I'm very sorry. 

149
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,243
 Regarding the Cloud Innovation feature... 

150
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,995
â™«  Can a happy ending be fixed?  â™«

151
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:53,220
â™«  Meeting you, approaching you  â™«

152
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,819
 I am sorry. 

153
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:56,223
 I shouldn't have lied to you. 

154
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:57,759
â™«  ...left me where I was standing  â™«

155
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,740
 Actually, I'd been wanting to tell you everything. 

156
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,780
 I just didn't know how to put it. 

157
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,620
 And I was also afraid that after I told you things would turn out like this. 

158
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,413
 Regarding all this, I am really, really sorry. 

159
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:17,558
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

160
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:22,539
â™«  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  â™«

161
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:24,770
â™«  Does it hurt  â™«

162
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,340
â™«  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  â™«

163
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,839
 It's all my fault. 

164
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,140
 If possible, I hope to apologize to you in person. 

165
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,599
 But I hope not to let my mistake affect the collaboration between Cloud Innovation. 

166
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,060
 Please. 

167
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,760
â™«  ...the harder it is to let go  â™«

168
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,000
 I'm sorry, but my feelings for you are sincere. 

169
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,250
â™«  Not only did I lie to you  â™«

170
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,381
 

171
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:06,490
â™«  ...but I also lied to myself  â™«

172
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:13,206
â™«  Otherwise, how could you ignore the scenery along the way?  â™«

173
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:20,766
â™«  Approaching you, avoiding you, loving you from a distance  â™«

174
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:29,712
â™«  Falling into a predicament, unwilling to sober up  â™«

175
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:34,607
â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

176
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:41,411
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

177
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:46,696
â™«  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  â™«

178
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,957
â™«  Does it hurt  â™«

179
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:55,327
â™«  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  â™«

180
00:15:55,327 --> 00:16:02,471
â™«  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  â™«

181
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:06,982
â™«  Don't say you can let go  â™«

182
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:08,740
â™«  Don't go far, okay?  â™«

183
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,280
The Cloud Innovation's feature article has been very well received.

184
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,300
The lead editor wants to strike while the iron is hot.

185
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,599
Shuyi. Next, you can put more effort into this.

186
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,740
Got it.

187
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,140
Do you have any ideas for the next issue?

188
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,179
Not at the moment.

189
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,760
Since you temporarily don't have any ideas...

190
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,920
There are several industry forums lately.

191
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,200
You can go there to gather inspiration.

192
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,140
Okay, Ms. Yi.

193
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:02,735
   

194
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,394
   

195
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,619
Mr. Shi, Professor Li's lab documents have been sorted and sent to your email.

196
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,540
 Hello, Mr. Shi. I am very sorry that my inappropriate behavior has upset you. 

197
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,319
 With your help and support, the first issue of Cloud Innovation was a great success. 

198
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,720
 This topic is very precious to both Financial Introduce and Cloud Innovation. 

199
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,399
 I hope you can put the past behind us and continue to cooperate with Financial Introduce. 

200
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:14,839
 And I will step down from this project handing over the work to my colleagues. 

201
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:19,000
 To ensure a smooth transition, I'm attaching the subsequent planning below. 

202
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,179
 Please review it. 

203
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,440
Mr. Shi, is there a problem with this material?

204
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,575
If someone you like was angry, what would you do?

205
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,179
Say something nice.

206
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,279
Apologize to her and hope for her to calm down.

207
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,960
What if the person was still very angry and blocked you?

208
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,480
If she was that angry, then I'd have to explain clearly.

209
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,759
I'd find a way to meet her and apologize.

210
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,479
If the first try failed, I'd try the second time.

211
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,900
What about sending an email?

212
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,119
That definitely wouldn't work!

213
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,160
Who sends emails nowadays...

214
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,900
...to apologize.

215
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,720
Mr. Shi.

216
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:17,273
   

217
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,959
The water is ready, Shuyi.

218
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,240
- Thank you. 
 - What's wrong?

219
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,259
- Nothing.   - I see you've not been in a good state lately. 

220
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:45,160
- Is it work... 
 - I'm going back to work.

221
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,240
I disagree, Zheng Shuyi.

222
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,780
Do you know what you're saying?

223
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,880
Who was it that insisted on doing this project?

224
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,793
Who wanted to upgrade the e-magazine and set it as an independent project?

225
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:25,860
Have you forgotten what you said?

226
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,519
Now you want to quit?

227
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,300
I disagree.

228
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:32,139
Sister Yi,

229
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:36,680
only if I step down can we save the Cloud Innovation project.

230
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,540
You and Shi Yan...

231
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,300
You'd better think it through.

232
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,880
You've poured so much effort into the project.

233
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,599
Let my colleagues handle it.

234
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,559
I will help them complete this project.

235
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,540
I'll think about it.

236
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,300
You think about it, too.

237
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,839
Mr Shi,

238
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,980
since I'm much older than Shi Yan, I'm not going to beat around the bush now.

239
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,300
Here's the thing.

240
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,640
Shi Yan gave up the lucrative opportunity of Lieying for Le'an Tech.

241
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,400
We didn't understand the decision, but we still supported him.

242
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,519
Yes. But you know the result.

243
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:39,319
The result is that Le'an Tech's core talent left to join a competing company.

244
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,440
It caused the lab to shut down directly.

245
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:46,360
Zhanlan is also the same.

246
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,000
Juhe is too young.

247
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,300
No one can be 100% sure that it won't be the next Le'an Tech.

248
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,539
Right.

249
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,640
Mr. Shi.

250
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,440
We discussed it and wanted to ask for a favor. Please hear us out.

251
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,000
We want Xiaoming to manage all operations of Cloud Innovation.

252
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,720
This way, we can prevent Shi Yan from making wrong decisions again due to lack of experience.

253
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,119
Old Tian,

254
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:25,778
do you remember what you said in my office over a decade ago?

255
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:29,580
Mr. Shi, it's been so many years. I can't remember. Remind me.

256
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,899
At the time, you said...

257
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,680
Xiaoming was too young to be well-seasoned.

258
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:42,559
He would make wrong decisions in the management capacity due to inexperience.

259
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,780
Shi Yan,

260
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,119
these gentlemen have always cared for you.

261
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,880
Regarding their criticism,

262
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,780
if it's true, make corrections.

263
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,920
If it's a misunderstanding, make improvements.

264
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:15,039
Cloud Innovation needs many people's protection and guidance to grow into a giant empire.

265
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,440
Thank you, gentlemen, for all your concern.

266
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,860
The choices to invest in Le'an Tech and Juhe were my own decisions.

267
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm fully responsible.

268
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,140
I will think of a solution to Le'an's issue soon, and stop you from worrying.

269
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,589
Zheng Shuyi's always been following this project.

270
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,619
No one is better suited than her for this project.

271
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,780
I won't miss any issue deadlines.

272
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,191
I can't make this arrangement.

273
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,379
I will have a good talk with her.

274
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,939
He doesn't want to see me now.

275
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,760
He even blacklisted me.

276
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,839
He doesn't reply to my emails.

277
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,920
I'm totally helpless.

278
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,240
I just hope it won't affect our collaboration on this project.

279
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,839
How come?

280
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,300
Why didn't you say it earlier...

281
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,019
I don't know what to do now.

282
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:36,559
 Now, I can't comfort you by pretending to feel the same. 

283
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:43,079
All I can say is things are already like this.

284
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,700
Do you know?

285
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,900
He even sent his niece away.

286
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,140
He doesn't want her near me.

287
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,480
 He completely doesn't want to hear anything about me anymore. 

288
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,900
Don't be too sad.

289
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,219
Maybe you can find a way to meet him. It's easier to talk in person.

290
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:01,239
I don't have the courage to see him.

291
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:05,460
Just thinking he doesn't want to see me makes me feel awful.

292
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,620
Then don't think about him.

293
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,359
Think about Yue Xingzhou and that Qin... Qin something.

294
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,820
 They're really suffering. 

295
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,599
 They must've lost all their appetite and sleep now. 

296
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,259
How about this? After work, go home, take a bath, order some crayfish, and watch some variety shows.

297
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:23,399
Sleep on it, and maybe things will turn around.

298
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,340
It's impossible.

299
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,859
Our relationship has ended.

300
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,640
All right, I won't talk anymore.

301
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,359
I'm working.

302
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,899
You've thought it over?

303
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,000
It's best for my colleagues to take over Cloud Innovation's project.

304
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,459
I will ensure a smooth handover.

305
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:08,240
If they need my help, I will do my best.

306
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,319
There's no need for credit.

307
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,939
I just hope Cloud Innovation's project can continue.

308
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,480
Then let's do as you said.

309
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,039
Organize your documents.

310
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,100
I will arrange the handover.

311
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,880
Okay.

312
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,200
Shuyi,

313
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,580
what did the chief editor say to you?

314
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,480
I will hand over the Cloud Innovation project.

315
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,340
What?

316
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,020
Just hearing it makes me feel bad for you.

317
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,680
It must be Xu Yuling who said something to the lead editor.

318
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,640
Otherwise, the chief editor wouldn't make this arrangement.

319
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,480
She doesn't understand Cloud Innovation at all. How can she do the project well?

320
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,659
What's happening with Cloud Innovation?

321
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,680
Why does Shuyi have to give up the Cloud Innovation project?

322
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,419
What?

323
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,680
When did they get together?

324
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,859
Then, why did they have a falling out?

325
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,020
Hello, students. Today, we'll talk about secondary markets.

326
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,440
Let's look at the big screen.

327
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,839
What is a secondary market?

328
00:27:57,499 --> 00:28:00,400
You put two accident reports of Zhanlan in the featured project.

329
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,939
And they are different.

330
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:06,119
It's a waste of my time looking at this stuff.

331
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:10,956
Zhanlan is a company Cloud Innovation once intended to invest in.

332
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:14,400
I've already marked the reasons for the differences in the document.

333
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,459
You can check carefully.

334
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,920
No need, thank you.

335
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,079
I rely on myself.

336
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,179
I have my own work method.

337
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:25,559
To do a project well requires the reporter's in-depth first-hand observation.

338
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,900
Your tricks won't play well.

339
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,640
What are you implying?

340
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,559
Nothing.

341
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,640
You think I don't know how you got the project from Shi Yan?

342
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,319
Opportunities gained through dirty tricks will eventually be lost.

343
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,200
Cloud Innovation's project will have nothing to do with you in the future.

344
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,259
Send the materials to my email later.

345
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,060
Then notify Guan Ji and Yu You.

346
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,720
Got it, Mr. Shi.

347
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,259
Mr. Shi, hello.

348
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:12,920
Long time no see. Do you remember me?

349
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,599
I'm Xu Yuling, a reporter from Financial Introduce.

350
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,039
I will be in charge of the Cloud Innovation project.

351
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,160
Ms. Xu, please return.

352
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,680
The collaboration between Cloud Innovation and Financial Introduce has ended.

353
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,759
Mr. Shi,

354
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,219
I've done a lot of preparatory work.

355
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:31,100
My articles will definitely increase Cloud Innovation's publicity.

356
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,680
I won't take up too much of your time.

357
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:37,842
 Mr. Shi, I had an interview with you scheduled for this afternoon. 

358
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,820
 Mr. Shi is going out. Ms. Zheng, please return. 

359
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,060
 Today's interview is already over. 

360
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,380
 I've been looking forward to this interview for a long time. 

361
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,219
 Finally, the day has come. 

362
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,980
 Can you spare some time now? 

363
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,039
 It will just take up a little bit of your time. Okay? 

364
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,359
I won't accept interviews from two reporters on the same project.

365
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,580
Thank you but no.

366
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,540
Mr. Shi, if you don't have time, I can interview other colleagues.

367
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,559
Please give me a chance!

368
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,599
Sorry, Ms. Xu, we really can't help.

369
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,499
Mr. Chen, I really won't take up too much of his time.

370
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,720
Please arrange it for me.

371
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
I can interview your colleagues, can I?

372
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,860
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,159
I...

374
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:22,500
Ms. Xu, let me escort you downstairs.

375
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,759
Will you spare a few minutes?

376
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,019
Shuyi, Xu Yuling went to Cloud Innovation?

377
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,519
Then, how can you remain so calm?

378
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,300
She must have interviewed Shi Yan.

379
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,559
No! You must take back the project.

380
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,559
It's your hard work.

381
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,339
No need.

382
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:07,219
As long as the project goes smoothly, whoever does it is the same.

383
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,879
Why are you here?

384
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,580
I came to pick you up from work.

385
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,200
Go home. I'm going home to write articles, too.

386
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,659
What if I say I can help you find inspiration?

387
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,039
I'm a professional journalist.

388
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,839
I don't need unprofessional methods to find inspiration.

389
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,780
Are you sure?

390
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,059
Shuyi?

391
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,379
Isn't the person next to her...

392
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:12,000
Yi Yang from Dark Horse Technology?

393
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:16,172
Good for her! A talented man and a beautiful woman. A match made in heaven!

394
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:19,707
Seriously? They don't look the part.

395
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:23,580
Why would Ms. Zheng be with him?

396
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,760
What's the problem?

397
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,300
Only Mr. Shi can accept interviews from others, but Shuyi can't be with someone else, huh?

398
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,931
When did Mr. Shi accept someone else's interview?

399
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:37,179
Mr. Shi didn't even give Ms. Xu a chance for an interview at all.

400
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:39,837
He didn't give her a chance? But she always goes to your company.

401
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:42,380
Since it's not Mr. Shi, is she interviewing you?

402
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,959
No.

403
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,580
How could it be me?

404
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,129
Do you know how much Shuyi has put into this project?

405
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:51,580
Mr. Shi just ends the collaboration on a whim.

406
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,279
He's really heartless.

407
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,219
The way I see it, dating is supposed to be happy and joyful.

408
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:00,380
I find Yi Yang quite good.

409
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,979
He's handsome and considerate.

410
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:04,580
And he finds time to please his girlfriend.

411
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,719
Mr. Shi must have his reasons.

412
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:12,219
Do you really think he's quite good?

413
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,820
Quite good, indeed.

414
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,740
But I already have my own boyfriend.

415
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,900
Let's go eat then.

416
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,839
Okay.

417
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,440
Let's go.

418
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:32,499
Weren't we here to find inspiration?

419
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:34,010
Why are we shopping now?

420
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,330
It's still early.

421
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,219
How about a movie?

422
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,359
Yi Yang.

423
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,040
You don't like it? Then how about we go to the night market?

424
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,280
I don't like night markets, nor do I need to buy anything.

425
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,939
Don't girls usually like night markets?

426
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,060
Maybe you'll find something you want to buy.

427
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,739
I'm no ordinary girl.

428
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:58,500
Who finds inspiration while shopping. I have absolutely no inspiration.

429
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,420
Sorry. I really have work to do.

430
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm going home.

431
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,540
If this place can't give you inspiration, let's go somewhere else.

432
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,979
Come on, punch towards the targets.

433
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,719
One, two. Good.

434
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,900
One, two, three.

435
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,659
Nice.

436
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,660
Continue, switch positions.

437
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,400
One, two, three. Continue.

438
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,119
One, two, three. Continue.

439
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,980
Switch, one, two.

440
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,519
One, two.

441
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,279
One, two, three.

442
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,020
One, two, three.

443
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,320
One, two, three, four.

444
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
Good, continue. One, two, three, four.

445
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,400
Good, continue. One, two, three, four.

446
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,839
Switch.

447
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:40,599
One, two.

448
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,060
How's that?

449
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,860
Pretty exhilarating, thank you.

450
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,739
Now, you've punched away all the troubles, and inspiration will naturally come arrive.

451
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,859
If you're ever unhappy, just come to me.

452
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,339
I'll be your sandbag.

453
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,667
Mr. Shi, hello.

454
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,680
She's here again.

455
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,978
She's too diligent to be good.

456
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:42,759
She's not going to bombard us with repetitive questions the whole afternoon again. Right?

457
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:44,900
It's such a waste of time.

458
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,280
Ms. Zheng's clearly categorized the information.

459
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,199
Tell her not to come again. And ask the agency to not send other people.

460
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,000
Remember to review the topics we touched upon today at home.

461
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,179
All right, let's call it a day.

462
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,926
   
   

463
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,540
Shuyi, I'd like to ask you something.

464
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,280
Do you have time tonight to have dinner together?

465
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,800
Have you been very busy recently?

466
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
You look tired.

467
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,480
Being busy is a good thing.

468
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,679
It's even worse to have nothing to do.

469
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,059
Don't you have an intern?

470
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:02,239
Can't the intern share some work?

471
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,860
You mean Shiyue?

472
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,440
She took a long leave.

473
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,100
I don't know when she'll be back.

474
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:11,960
She's fine.

475
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,579
It's just her family is worried about her.

476
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,079
They want her to rest more.

477
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,200
Uh...

478
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,379
How's Cloud Innovation lately?

479
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:28,179
I heard that there seems to be some disagreement within the company.

480
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,400
Shuyi, do you want to ask if Shi Yan is all right?

481
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,079
Are you and Shi Yan together?

482
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:46,400
We just started dating.

483
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,000
But now, it might be over.

484
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,860
Shi Yan is not a grudge holder.

485
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,000
Though he usually looks aloof, he wouldn't get angry easily.

486
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
He must care about you a lot.

487
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,639
That's why he's like this.

488
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:06,760
Talk to him, clarify things, and it will be all right.

489
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,340
I've already apologized to him.

490
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,639
But he blocked me.

491
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,380
I haven't been able to contact him since.

492
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,640
How did you apologize?

493
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
I...

494
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,700
After listening to you, I think... maybe...

495
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:32,639
He's angry because, after all this, you only care about your work and ignore his feelings.

496
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,779
You're right. It's my fault.

497
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:41,300
I was thinking about the solutions to and the impacts of our fall-out.

498
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:47,179
But I didn't consider his feelings as his girlfriend.

499
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,200
That's terrible.

500
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,420
Now that you understand, you know what to do.

501
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,940
Thank you, Yu You.

502
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,819
But I didn't expect you to be so adept at handling romantic problems.

503
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,559
Actually, I just realized recently that theory is meaningless when it comes to love.

504
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,080
Being in a relationship, you can only follow your heart.

505
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,899
That's right. Preconceptions are useless.

506
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:24,500
I never thought I would have anything to do with someone like Shi Yan.

509
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,120
 - Are you cold? 
 - Not really. 

510
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,840
 - Then let's go over there. 
 - No, I'm not going. 

511

â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

512
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:57,015
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

513
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:58,679
â™«  Luckily, you didn't go far away  â™«

514
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,880
- Hello. 
  Mr. Shi, I contacted Financial Introduce, 

515
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,179
 Lead Editor Lv said Ms. Zheng voluntarily gave up the project. 

516
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,140
Got it.

517
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,650
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

518
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:16,480
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

519
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,224
 He's angry because, after all this, you only care about your work and ignore his feelings. 

520
00:40:23,224 --> 00:40:26,934
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

521
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:32,480
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

522
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,153
But how can I let you know that I care about you?

523
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:42,752
â™«  I want to do everything for you  â™«

524
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:49,911
â™«  I want to say I'm loving you every morning  â™«

525
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:54,916
â™«  You can only fall into my arms  â™«

526
00:40:54,916 --> 00:41:03,494
â™«  No matter how windy, snowy, and cold it is, I will give you warmth  â™«

527
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:12,779
â€‹â™«  I will give you warmth  â™«

528
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,540
 Lead Editor Lv said Ms. Zheng voluntarily gave up the project. 

529
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,279
Uncle? Why didn't you turn on the light?  You scared me to death.

530
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,339
Uncle, are you in a bad mood?

531
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,679
My bad. I won't ask.

532
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,000
Tell me.

533
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,299
Suppose a girl always proactively pursued a man.

534
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:01,159
Then they...

535
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,139
Then they had some problems.

536
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:07,900
And then the girl completely stopped contacting that man.

537
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,760
What could be the reason?

538
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,559
What reason could there be?

539
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,879
Being proactive is tiring.

540
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:18,979
In a relationship, a man should also take the initiative sometimes.

541
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:22,020
Isn't this the time for the man to be proactive?
