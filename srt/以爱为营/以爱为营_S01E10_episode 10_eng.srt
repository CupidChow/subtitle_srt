 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,600
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,600
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,800
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,400
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,700
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,000
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,200
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,600
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,600
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,000
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,600
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,000
   

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
   

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,200
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,000
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,400
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,900
   

27
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,100
   

28
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,400
I forgot that I have his WeChat ID now.

29
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,300
 I've got a date today. So I won't come. 

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,000
 I've got a date today, too. So I won't come either. 

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,300
 Morning~ 

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
 Love you! 

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,200
 Don't forget the concert tonight. 

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
   

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
 Do you want to have dinner together? 

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,200
Forget it. If it's too much, it's better to just give it up.

37
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,500
 Please line up and enter in an orderly fashion. 

38
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,400
Well, what a coincidence.

39
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,800
Coincidence? Aren't you the one who asked me out?

40
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,900
The one that I invited isâ€¦

41
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,400
 Wait. Shi Yan, SY. 

42
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,000
 SY, Shiyue. 

43
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm kidding you.

44
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,000
I was just about to rush you, and here you are.

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Well, that's quite a coincidence.

46
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Yeah, a coincidence.

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then let's go in.

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
Sure.

49
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,400
   

50
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,300
â™«  Amidst countless wonders  â™«

51
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,100
â™«  I never look back  â™«

52
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,600
â™«  Raindrops dance on eaves  â™«

53
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,800
â™«  The place where I suddenly look back  â™«

54
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,800
â™«  There you are, amidst dimming lights  â™«

55
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,400
â™«  I am destined to be with you  â™«

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,200
â™«  I am destined to be with you  â™«

57
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,200
â™«  I wish there were no partings in this world  â™«

58
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,400
â™«  May the drifting boat dock to its shore  â™«

59
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:54,500
â™«  May lovers eventually reach perfection  â™«

60
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,200
â™«  And never change in this life  â™«

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
   

62
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,600
â™«  Amidst countless wonders  â™«

63
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,400
What's the matter?

64
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,800
This song is really sad.

65
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,200
I can't bear to think about it.

66
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,000
â™«  And never change in this life  â™«

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,500
Shuyi, did you just fall out of love? So the song hurts your feelings.

68
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,000
â™«  There you are, amidst dimming lights  â™«

69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,900
My boyfriend and I just broke up a month ago.

70
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,000
He cheated on me.

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
But the song doesn't hurt my feelings.

72
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,100
I was just thinking. Girls shouldn't be sad during a breakup.

73
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,800
It's the cheater who should die.

74
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,100
â™«  Love rings are exchanged on the ring fingers  â™«

75
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,400
You're absolutely right.

76
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
â™«  I wish there were no partings in this world  â™«

77
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,100
But, Shuyi, why would someone cheat on you?

78
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,400
You're super pretty.

79
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
â™«  May lovers eventually reach perfection  â™«

80
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Yeah, but the fact is, I was cheated on.

81
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,600
I have every reason to believe he's blind.

82
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,500
He cares not about looks but money.

83
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,300
The girl he left me for has a rich uncle.

84
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,200
â™«  And never change in this life  â™«

85
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,600
Good for you to move on so quickly, Shuyi.

86
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
I admire you.

87
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,500
But then I realized that the rich girl's uncle was very attractive.

88
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,700
So I have mixed feelings right now.

89
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,600
What are you waiting for?

90
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,800
I'm telling you, don't over-think it.

91
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
You've lost your ex-boyfriend now.

92
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,400
You can't afford to lose this new boyfriend.

93
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
The girl's uncle isn't as bad as his niece, is he?

94
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,400
No. The two are completely different.

95
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,000
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,400
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

98
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,000
â™«  If love is like a cloud  â™«

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,200
â™«  Always erratic  â™«

100
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,200
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

101
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,200
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

102
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,500
â™«  I will also be cautious  â™«

103
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,800
â™«  I will also be breathless  â™«

104
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,600
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

105
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,000
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,100
â™«  I hear your heart whispering  â™«

107
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,200
â™«  The unresolved clouds  â™«

108
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
â™«  Are deserted and sweet  â™«

109
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,100
â™«  I can't grasp it, so I take a deep breath  â™«

110
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,000
â™«  Let flowing breaths fill my memory  â™«

111
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,600
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

112
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400
- Shuyi, I'll go home first. 
 - All right, be careful on the road.

113
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,000
Bye.

114
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
   

115
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,500
 Professor Yu? Is he a fan of Mom's? 

116
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Mom, can I get some limited edition albums from when you first started out?

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,100
I mean limited edition albums that aren't for sale now.

118
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Shuyi, what a coincidence.

119
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,700
Professor Yu, what a coincidence that you're here, too.

120
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,600
Shi Yan gave me a ticket, so I came here to relax.

121
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Since you've read my outline, can we schedule the interview this week?

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,400
No problem. How about Tuesday at 3:00 p.m?

123
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,900
Sure.

124
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,200
I'll give you a ride.

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
No, I'll take a taxi.

126
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Be safe on the road.

127
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,900
Bye.

128
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,600
 Since you've come to me, I will seize the opportunity! 

129
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,200
Mr. Shi, I sprained my ankle.

130
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I sprained my ankle because of you. You should be responsible for me.

131
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
Why?

132
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,900
Because I can't focus my attention on the road with you around.

133
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,085
 Miss, where are you? 

134
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,000
Stay there. I'm coming to you now.

135
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,000
Shi Yan, don't be so insensitive! Shi Yan!

136
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,900
Gosh, why am I so unlucky?

137
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,400
Shi Yan, you don't have a heart.

138
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,000
You're heartless.

139
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,500
Am I not beautiful?

140
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,900
Don't you have any compassion?

141
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,100
You're not nearsighted, you're just blind to real beauty.

142
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,200
People like you should stay lonely forever!

143
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,500
No one'sâ€”

144
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Go ahead. Why did you stop?

145
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,400
I should do what and no one's doing what?

146
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,400
Mr. Shi, I think I can get in the car first before explaining it to you.

147
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
You haven't yet thought of an excuse?

148
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,000
What's the hurry?

149
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Even for a test there's a 90-minute answer period.

150
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,700
It hurts.

151
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,000
I must have broken a bone.

152
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,800
It hurts!

153
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
You're quite talkative.

154
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,401
   

155
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Get out of the car. Let's have a doctor check your bones.

156
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,600
My feet hurt. I can't stand and I'm sure I can't walk.

157
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,800
I wouldn't have sprained my ankle if it wasn't for you.

158
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,200
You're responsible for this.

159
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,400
Zheng Shuyi, stop pretending.

160
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm not!

161
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Can't you be a little more considerate?

162
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,200
Is your heart made of stone?

163
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,000
- No, it's not. 
 - Then youâ€¦

164
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,600
I don't have a heart. You said so yourself.

165
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,300
Why are you so vindictive?

166
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,600
Try twisting your ankle in these shoes.

167
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,100
It's like having your ankle snapped alive. It hurts.

168
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,600
You wouldn't know the feeling since you've never worn them.

169
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,002
   

170
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,200
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

171
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,700
â™«  It's your shining eyes  â™«

172
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,000
â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

173
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,700
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

174
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,600
â™«  Luckily, you didn't go far away  â™«

175
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:23,600
â™«  I can still tightly hold your hand  â™«

176
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,100
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

177
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:37,300
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

178
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,600
Did your ex-girlfriend ever tell you that you look good from this angle?

179
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,700
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

180
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,200
Did your ex-boyfriend ever say you were heavy?

181
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,500
No, never.

182
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,600
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

183
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
No one's ever carried me like this.

184
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,200
But I think you have the potential to be my first boyfriend to say that to me.

185
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,000
   

186
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,900
It hurts so much!

187
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,400
That's a big reaction. I was very gentle.

188
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
I can't stand pain. It hurts so much.

189
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,500
Hello, Sis.

190
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Oh, that was a show for him.

191
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Not really.

192
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,100
I said it wouldn't hurt that much.

193
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,200
You'll have to ice it for 48 hours after you go home.

194
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
If it still hurts, remember to apply some medicine to invigorate the blood.

195
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Try not to walk around. Okay?

196
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
Thank you, doctor.

197
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think although your boyfriend's quite handsome.

198
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,500
He's a little too unsympathetic and hard-hearted.

199
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
That's not true, doctor.

200
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
He's not hard-hearted.

201
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,200
Won't allow me to criticize your love?

202
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
He has no heart at all.

203
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,900
Why isn't he back yet?

204
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,400
I'm sure he's making payments right now.

205
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
He's not gone, is he?

206
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,400
I still can't walk.

207
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,900
This is a medical miracle. What a great doctor!

208
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,400
Can you get in the car by yourself?

209
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
   

210
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,519
 Shi Yan, are you still in touch with that Bei Lin? 

211
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,080
 I mean your ex, the good-looking actress. 

212
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,759
 I have a friend who wants to make a movie with her. 

213
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,800
 Can you put in a few words if you can? 

214
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,799
 Hello? Can you hear me? 

215
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,419
Her? I think her acting isn't so good.

216
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,480
It's not as good as the one in my car.

217
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,780
 Thank you very much! 

218
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,147
 The one in your car? 

219
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,759
 Sorry for the interruption, bye. 

220
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,039
Turns out his ex is really that popular actress.

221
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,699
Ex?

222
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,039
Since he said my acting is better,

223
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,260
am I to take it that he thinks I'm better than her?

224
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,799
She's just an ex, anyway.

225
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,640
I've come this far so no matter what, I can't give up now.

226
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,839
You're doing this on purpose. You know your uncle doesn't eat hotpot.

227
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,019
How do you know?

228
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:03,380
Shi Yan.

229
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,319
Uncle, we've almost finished eating. You're too late.

230
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,100
Something came up.

231
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,519
You asked me to not forget the meal. Yet you showed up late.

232
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:16,500
Yueyue, don't make your uncle scold you on the rare occasion that we finally meet.

233
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,559
Tell me what's going on with you and your supervisor.

234
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,279
My uncle knows about this, too.

235
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,839
I misunderstood my supervisor.

236
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,759
So I wanted to friend her on Wechat and apologize.

237
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,319
I didn't expect her to greet me so warmly when I friended her.

238
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,834
And then she even invited me to a concert. I was so confused.

239
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
She invited you to the concert today?

240
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, but it's kind of weird.

241
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,160
It was like I was not the one she wanted to invite.

242
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,359
But it doesn't matter. We had a great time.

243
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:55,799
You misunderstood her, yet you didn't feel guilty going to the concert with her.

244
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,730
Uncle, why are you so mean?

245
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,400
You're always holding grudges.

246
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,440
Come, congratulations on the show.

247
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,740
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

248
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:15,859
    
    

249
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:24,139
 I almost forgot, I haven't sent you today's medical fees. 

250
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,880
Mom, Uncle is in love with an actress again.

251
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,079
Don't be ridiculous.

252
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,920
Guan Ji said there was an actress in your car.

253
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,000
I just saw her send you a message.

254
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,200
Shi Yan, who is she? Do I know her?

255
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,559
They're just talking nonsense. Just ignore them.

256
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,580
I did see you texting her.

257
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,799
Come on, don't believe whatever you hear.

258
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,640
That's how gossip gets spread.

259
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,780
Your uncle knows what he's doing.

260
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,200
But love is about cherishing. That's how you can win her love.

261
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,900
Shi Yan, if you meet the right person, cherish them.

262
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,750
Don't miss the chance.

263
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,400
That's right! Isn't Uncle Cheng going to have a family dinner tomorrow night?

264
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,160
Go with Shiyue if you don't have a female companion.

265
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,600
There's no need.

266
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,160
Uncle, of course, I'd like to go with you.

267
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,119
No ordinary woman can go to a banquet with you.

268
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,139
Don't act cheap and still flaunt obedience.

269
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,599
Sis, take your time. I'm going to the bathroom.

270
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,200
Okay.

271
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,920
There's something going on with him.

272
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,559
Focus on your meal.

273
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,980
 He's definitely in love! 

274
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,406
 I'm going to find out which actress it is. 

275
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,654
   

276
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:04,092
   

277
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,680
 Are you Shi Yan? 

278
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:19,440
   

279
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,139
 Who else can I be? 

280
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:26,060
â™«  Not accidentally  â™«

281
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,424
 How much did you pay today? I'll transfer it to you. 

282
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:31,621
â™«  It's not just to hear the words "I'm sorry"  â™«

283
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:33,880
   
   

284
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,224
Which hospital charges so insanely?

285
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:38,799
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

286
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,021
 Is this covered by ordinary medical plans? 

287
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:44,834
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

288
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,074
   

289
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:48,077
   

290
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,680
   

291
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,979
 That's so nice of you. 

292
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,380
 Consider it today's acting paycheck. 

293
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,300
Only 2,000 yuan for my Academy-Award level acting!

294
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,739
You're so stingy.

295
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:07,799
 Only 2,000 for my Academy-Award level acting! 

296
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,623
 How much do you want? 

297
00:27:09,623 --> 00:27:12,279
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

298
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,019
 I want you to have dinner with me tomorrow 

299
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,912
 You sure like to dream. 

300
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:21,623
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

301
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:26,351
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

302
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:30,961
   

303
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,062
â™«  The unresolved clouds  â™«

304
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:35,322
â™«  Are deserted and sweet  â™«

305
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,741
â™«  I can't grasp it, so I take a deep breath  â™«

306
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:44,200
â™«  Let flowing breaths fill my memory  â™«

307
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,431
 What are having for dinner? What should I wear? 

308
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:51,756
â™«  No need to ask, I am willing  â™«

309
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,840
 Which one do I look good in? 

310
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,170
   

311
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,459
Red?

312
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,400
I don't see a red one.

313
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,253
Is he being absent-minded or is he color-blind?

314
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:17,039
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

315
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,356
He's not talking about that red clothing, is he?

316
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:24,346
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

317
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:31,191
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

318
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,319
Does this dress look good, Xingzhou?

319
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,279
It's nice.

320
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,000
 How could it be him? 

321
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,640
Hello.

322
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,880
 Shuyi, what are you doing? Let's go shopping. 

323
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,260
I'm already shopping.

324
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,240
It's my bad luck to run into my cheating ex and the girl.

325
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,540
 Really? Where are you now? 

326
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,219
IFS Shopping Mall.

327
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:21,880
I'm so unlucky.

328
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,400
I feel like I have to wash my eyes after seeing them.

329
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,020
 IFS huh? Wait for me! I'll be right there. 

330
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,850
This is as bland as an old lady's dress.

331
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,240
It doesn't suit me at all.

332
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,799
This one's a lousy choice, too.

333
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,810
Turtleneck sweaters will ruin my foundation.

334
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,030
Get another one.

335
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,200
"Ruin my foundation."

336
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,759
Don't you think this dress is a bit too simple to be stylish?

337
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,960
Not at all, the simpler, the classier.

338
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,519
The bright red makes you radiant.

339
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,399
And the Spring Festival is around the corner. It'll be perfect when you visit loved ones.

340
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,920
But it feels just weird around my shoulders.

341
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,200
Xingzhou.

342
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,980
Xingzhou.

343
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,880
Is this good?

344
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,160
Yes, it is.

345
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,619
Never mind. I'll check something else.

346
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:48,680
Miss, this dress is perfect for you.

347
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,240
It goes so well with your fair complexion that it's glowing. The red color is tailor-made for your skin tone.

348
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,819
You look better than any fashion model.

349
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,479
Thank you.

350
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:02,119
I want to take a picture to show my friend.

351
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,720
Solid-state batteries are crucial to the development of new energy vehicles.

352
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,619
Semi-solid-state batteries are going to take off.

353
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:19,440
Zhanlan is most likely to first mass-produce them.

354
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,620
This round of financing means a lot to them.

355
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,279
Zhanlan's got a good semi-solid-state battery.

356
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,599
They're the best in the market of new high-performance batteries.

357
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,880
Okay, you've done your research.

358
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,659
I'll follow your lead and contribute to our country's carbon-clean goal.

359
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:46,039
 Is it good? Say "good". 

360
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,759
Are you smiling?

361
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,619
What are you smiling for?

362
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,519
Nothing.

363
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,098
   

364
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,680
So, do you have a female date for the evening?

365
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,359
Let's go together. I don't have a date.

366
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm not going with you.

367
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:17,039
How funny.

368
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,119
You don't have a date tonight, yet he has a date.

369
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,957
Yeah.

370
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
 Passable. 

371
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
 You're so mean. 

372
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,400
 Would it kill you to say something nice? 

373
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,200
It's ugly.

374
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
Get me something else.

375
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,460
Honey, I like all of these.

376
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,200
Why don't you buy them all for me?

377
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,200
Hurry up. We have to go to dinner later.

378
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,400
Miss, do you want all these clothes?

379
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,000
They all look good on you.

380
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,600
Sis!

381
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,300
Are you done choosing?

382
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
There, there! Let me choose one for you.

383
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,200
Well, older sisterâ€¦

384
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,800
Your taste is impressive.

385
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,200
You pinpointed the ugliest pieces for me.

386
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,000
Thank you for saving me time.

387
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,800
You sure you're going to pay?

388
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,200
Of course I am.

389
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Is this appropriate?

390
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,600
What's wrong with that?

391
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,000
I've got a secondary card linked to my uncle's. Rest assured.

392
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
That's even more inappropriate. I don't even know your uncle.

393
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You said you wanted it. Don't go back on your word.

394
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,600
It's time to toughen up in front of your ex.

395
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Consider it a gesture of gratitude for the concert you invited me to.

396
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,000
And also compensation for something beforeâ€¦

397
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,600
What compensation?

398
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,800
No, nothing.

399
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,400
Sister Shuyi, consumerism will never be betrayed by you.

400
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,100
The clothes you buy are yours forever.

401
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,900
It's a lot more reliable than some men.

402
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,200
Miss, it's done.

403
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,000
Thank you.

404
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,900
Thank you, older sister.

405
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Are you crazy?

406
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,100
Calm done.

407
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,500
These clothes are not great. Forget it, let's go.

408
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,920
Not so great?

409
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,600
But you couldn't tear your eyes of her outfit!

410
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,500
What a loser.

411
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,000
Sister Shuyi.

412
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,800
Put your favorite one on.

413
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,300
Shuyi, do you have plans later. Let's have dinner together.

414
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,200
No, I'm meeting someone.

415
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,000
I see. No wonder you're out shopping for clothes.

416
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,100
Good for you.

417
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,060
Then, what are you waiting for?

418
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,500
Good luck.

419
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,000
Isn't this dress a bit too much?

420
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,900
Zheng Shuyi.

421
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,500
Where are you going?

422
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,000
I want to go home, put my stuff away, and change my clothes.

423
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
No need to change.

424
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
You look good in this.

425
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,600
He held my hand, saying I looked good.

426
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Then he turned silent after getting in the car.

427
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Men are so fickle.

428
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,000
   

429
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,600
It's a nice courtyard.

430
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
Let's go inside.

431
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,500
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

432
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,400
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

433
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,800
 It's a surprise that you can pick a proper dating spot. 

434
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,800
â™«  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  â™«

435
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
What are you looking at?

436
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,100
You.

437
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,200
What's wrong with me?

438
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,600
You're different today. You look stunning.

439
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,600
â™«  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  â™«

440
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,800
â™«  Roses reveal a hidden ambiguity  â™«

441
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,000
- It's time to be seated. 
 - Be seated?

442
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,800
This is my uncle's family feast.

443
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,500
Many people will come.

444
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,100
Aren't you having dinner with me?

445
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,200
Doesn't this count as dining with you?

446
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Fine.

447
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,000
This is not the kind of dinner I want. Okay?

448
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,400
You can invite me to another dinner after this one.

449
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,500
â™«  A delusion in the smoke  â™«

450
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,800
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

451
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,200
Let's go.

452
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,201
Shi Yan is dating someone again.

453
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:47,239
How long has he been single?

454
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:51,580
 - Why exactly did he and Bei Lin break up?  
  - Who dumped who? 

455
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,300
 - Who is she?]  
  - This is his new girlfriend? 

456
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,400
 She's good-looking. Is she a celebrity? 

457
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
 I've never seen her before. 

458
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
 I'd say she's as good-looking as Bei Lin. 

459
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,600
Shi Yan. It's been a long time.

460
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,300
Yes, it is.

461
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,500
I haven't been paying much attention to the entertainment industry lately.

462
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,300
She isâ€¦?

463
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,700
Ah, I remember.

464
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,200
Were you the lead actress in the web series "Princess Qin Lan"?

465
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,100
That rings a bell. The heroine in the show is very pretty.

466
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,500
Yet you look even better in a modern outfit.

467
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,400
I'm sorry, you two may be mistaken. I'm a reporter.

468
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

469
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,600
Let's go.

470
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,800
 He just spent the night with an actress yesterday. 

471
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,100
 Then today there's a beautiful reporter. 

472
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,400
 What a rich playboy! 

473
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
What is it?

474
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,600
Are you still thinking about her?

475
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,800
What are you talking about?

476
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,400
You know what I'm talking about.

477
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,100
I've seen it all today.

478
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,800
You never looked at me like that.

479
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,200
What's between me and her is in the past. It's not what you think.

480
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,400
You didn't even buy me clothes. I think you just don't love me.

481
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,700
You don't want to spend money on me, do you?

482
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,100
You're mistaken. I'm trying to save up for our future.

483
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,000
How about this? When you persuade your uncle,

484
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,600
and when he let me work at Cloud Innovation,

485
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,700
I'll buy you whatever you want. kay?

486
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,000
Come on, let's drink first.

487
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Cheers.

488
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,200
Thank you.

489
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,800
   
 Shuyi, are you busy? 

490
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
 I'm sorry about today. 

491
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,300
 I have something to tell you. 

492
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,300
 Shuyi, are you busy? What are you doing? 

493
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,800
 I'm making a cake. 

494
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
What's wrong with her?

495
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,100
Nothing.

496
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,400
Maybe it's a dessert craving.

497
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,900
 Some people are alive but they're as good as dead. 

498
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,600
Hello. Who ordered this?

499
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,100
Here.

500
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,200
Well, someone wants some cake.

501
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,600
 Shi Yan, how dare you make fun of me in front of so many people! 

502
