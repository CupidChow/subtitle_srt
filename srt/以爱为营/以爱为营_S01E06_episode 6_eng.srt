â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars

â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

15
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:12,945
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

â™«  My hair blows in the wind,

â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

19
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:36,025
   

20
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,111
   

21
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:45,480
Eat it by yourself. I'm going home.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,899
Are you going home to meet Ms. Zheng?

23
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,840
Did I say something wrong?

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,680
You said you didn't want to talk about personal matters in the workplace.

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,019
Wasn't it too abrupt?

26
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,000
Will he get mad and not let me go to see him?

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,000
What time is it now? Zheng Shuyi, you can't lose.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,400
I don't care if he's mad I need to get his opinion today.

29
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:07,155
â™«  Not accidentally  â™«

30
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:11,928
â™«  It's not just a coincidence  â™«

31
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:19,970
â™«  It's not just to hear the words "I'm sorry"  â™«

32
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,917
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

33
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:29,674
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

34
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:33,940
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

35
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,139
Ms. Zheng, why are you here so late?

36
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,818
 Don't act like you don't remember you rejected all my drafts. 

37
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:44,879
â™«  If love is like a cloud  â™«

38
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,579
I just felt that you might want to see me.

39
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,183
That's why I came to see you.

40
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:52,663
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

41
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:56,599
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

42
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,619
Tell me. Why did you think that I wanted to see you?

43
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,100
â™«  I will also be breathless  â™«

44
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,454
Then what did you reject my draft three times for?

45
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,719
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

46
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,561
Oh, so that's why you came.

47
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,280
Good, you made your point clear in a proper manner.

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,220
And your logic is sound.

49
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,968
I'm almost tempted to take your view.

50
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,220
â™«  Clouds that hang in the balance  â™«

51
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,279
Even my chief editor and lead editor,

52
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,720
the two most picky financial journalists, think my draft is good.

53
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,533
Yet you rejected it three times without giving me any concrete advice.

54
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,140
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

55
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,040
Is there any other reason other than that you want to see me?

56
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,720
My reasons is that I'm not satisfied.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,199
Not satisfied with what?

58
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,079
Point one problem out and I'll make changes.

59
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,299
I'll keep changing until you're satisfied.

60
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,120
If you can't pinpoint the problem,

61
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,010
then the only explanation is that you wanted to see me.

62
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,430
You deliberately used this method to attract my attention and make me come to you.

63
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,539
There was too much praise in your first draft.

64
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,959
As far as I understand, a good personal interview is different from normal corporate PR stories.

65
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,863
It should be more rational and objective.

66
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,560
Journalists can have their likes and dislikes.

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,839
But it shouldn't interfere with the reader's reading and thinking.

68
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,199
You should know this yourself.

69
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,519
So in the second draft, you switched to objective statements.

70
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,399
There is nothing missing in the content,

71
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,839
but it lacks relative focus because it cares too much about completion and objectivity.

72
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,900
but it lacks relative focus because it cares too much about completion and objectivity.

73
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,959
The focus of this interview should be on the future of Cloud Innovation

74
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,260
not the Mingyu Group or my personal development.

75
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,240
And what's wrong with the third draft?

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,800
You've put a lot of work into it and made noticeable improvements.

77
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,820
But I think the interview should leave room for further discussion.

78
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,240
I remember telling you this in the car the other day.

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,879
I think a company's technological capabilities and innovativeness

80
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,839
to some extent underlies its competitiveness and development.

81
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,480
I threw out this point to invite discussion.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,260
I didn't mean it to be a conclusion.

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,399
In general, I think when you're writing an official article.

84
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,499
be authentic and focus on my most honest views and the tone I use.

85
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,620
I humbly accept your opinions.

86
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,778
It's true that my previous drafts had problems.

87
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,000
But everyone can have their own interpretation.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,979
Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m going to have to rewrite the entire story just because of a tone issue.

89
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,419
It's been days revising the drafts.

90
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,839
I won't make the deadline if it's delayed any longer.

91
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,920
I really want to write a good feature story. Please help me.

92
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,439
Cloud Innovation has a reputation of honesty.

93
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,560
We've always been taking a rigorous approach.

94
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,259
Because of different interpretations, you made me sound more absolute

95
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,360
and altered my views and judgment.

96
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
But really, I'm more interested in exploring the possibilities of this industry.

97
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,439
That's a major difference.

98
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,519
And the impact of the interview will be profound.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,530
I see what you mean.

100
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,470
I'll change it now.

101
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,235
Follow me.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,091
Don't rewrite it here. Come inside.

103
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:41,428
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

104
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,792
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

106
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,480
 Am I going to his place at this late hour? 

107
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,279
 Isn't this inconvenient? 

108
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,051
 What if I walk into his niece? 

109
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,612
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

110
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,300
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

111
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,570
Mr. Shi, is it convenient for me to go to your place at this hour?

112
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,439
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

113
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,814
You've been blocking my doorstep and now you're worried about my inconvenience.

114
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:11,120
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,810
Am I not eager to revise the draft?

116
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,399
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

117
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,159
Don't worry. No one will bother you.

118
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,060
I'm sure you can rewrite the story until I'm satisfied.

119
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,195
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

120
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:25,795
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

121
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:29,402
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

122
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:35,388
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

123
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:50,947
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

124
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,021
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

125
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:56,415
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

126
00:08:56,415 --> 00:09:00,270
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

127
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,309
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

128
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,743
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

129
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:10,133
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

130
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,559
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

131
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,968
 So she really only means to rewrite her draft. 

132
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:19,464
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

133
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:26,840
Shiyue, are you sure this is going to work?

134
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm sure.

135
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,839
This gift is very rare, even for my uncle.

136
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,480
The wine's good enough

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,240
but I advise you not to get your hopes up.

138
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,739
If he finds out that your gift was to beg him to allow you not to go to work,

139
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,699
I can't imagine what he'd do.

140
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,419
Why don't you give it to me? Don't waste it.

141
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,340
It's a beautiful thought. I'm counting on this to save me from fire and water.

142
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,759
You won't help me and even grandpa won't help me.

143
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,740
This bottle of wine is my last hope.

144
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,316
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

145
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:44,332
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

146
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:47,397
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

147
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,519
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

148
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,434
Fancy something to drink?

149
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,820
Lemonade, please.

150
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,984
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

No, nothing.

188
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,650
Then, why are you staring?

189
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,459
I think I want to drink what you are holding in your hand.

Thank you.

197
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,439
 He didn't even look at me. 

198
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,799
 This so-called charmer's lipstick isn't working. 

199
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,279
Hello.

200
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,319
I'm busy. Now's not the best time.

201
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:15,899
 Wait! Uncle. 

202
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,659
 The love-wrecker. 

203
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,052
What's going on?

204
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,200
Does anyone want to come over?

205
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,879
No.

206
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,120
Is that niece of yours coming back?

207
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,760
You seem to be interested in my niece.

208
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,810
No, not at all. I don't even know her.

209
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,200
He said he's busy and refused me.

210
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,500
He said the same to me last time.

211
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,080
Men are never busy.

212
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,979
Unless a man's with a woman.

213
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:07,759
Your uncle must've invited a nice lady over.

214
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,039
Invited a nice lady over?

215
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,340
It's been three years and my ever-so-cold uncle has finally fallen in love!

216
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,619
Have you seen his girlfriend?

217
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,600
How am I supposed to meet her when Shi Yan won't let me.

218
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,960
Have you ever seen him bring his girlfriend home?

219
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,679
It's done. What do you think?

220
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,000
Too long-winded.

221
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:50,679
Okay.

222
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,759
I can definitely get it done.

223
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,400
It's been shortened. Let me know if there's anything else.

224
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,640
That's not what I meant here.

225
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,940
What did you mean?

226
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,680
Think for yourself...

227
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,240
or do you prefer that I write it for you?

228
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,540
This one's good.

229
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,300
Really?

230
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,400
Are there really no more changes to be made?

231
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,160
It's passable.

232
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:34,200
Since you're satisfied, can we take a step further?

233
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,617
A step further?

234
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,739
Yes, a step furtherâ€¦

235
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,440
to discuss featured serial interviews.

236
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,859
Since you are satisfied with my story, I'm sure you'll be satisfied with my rewriting services.

237
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,799
So, could you consider my previous proposal of serial interviews?

238
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,720
What's in it for me to take a step further with you?

239
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,980
If you accept my offer, I'll be sure to finish the series well.

240
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,032
I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

241
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,079
But I do have one small favor to ask.

242
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,899
I'd like to publish these articles in the e-version of Financial Introduce.

243
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,279
Are all the journalists at your financial agency so good at business?

244
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,340
I haven't agreed to your plan yet.

245
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,860
So don't ask me for anything else.

246
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,000
It's because I didn't think carefully and was abrupt.

247
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,780
I should go step by step.

248
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,440
We'll discuss it after this featured interview.

249
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,480
 Did I say something to offend him? 

250
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,559
 Mr. Shi says no personal matters during work hours. 

251
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,319
 Yeah, he doesn't like to talk about personal matters during work hours. 

252
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,859
 So I guess he dislikes discussing business in private time. 

253
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,540
Please consider my proposal, Mr. Shi.

254
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,759
Also, could you please confirm the draft through email?

255
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,079
My PR team will take care of it as per standard practice.

256
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,739
I'll go over it again tomorrow, too.

257
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:49,799
Okay, Mr. Shi.

258
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,419
Let me know if you have any questions tomorrow.

259
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,279
I can revise it at any time. That's totally fine with me.

260
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,419
Is it really okay?

261
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,240
It's really no problem.

262
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,680
You were in another man's house in the middle of the night for so long.

263
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,860
Are you sure your boyfriend's fine with it?

264
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,079
I don't have a boyfriend.

265
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,519
I'm not joking.

266
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,160
The day I met you for the first time, I broke up with him when I got back.

267
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,480
It was on the day of the Guan dinner outside the Warner Manor, you remember?

268
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:40,860
So?

269
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,499
Soâ€¦

270
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:49,720
â™«  It's not just to hear the words "I'm sorry"  â™«

271
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,839
...can I pursue you?

272
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,621
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

273
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:03,224
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«

274
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:11,519
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

275
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,463
If I say no, will you stop?

276
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,043
No, I won't.

277
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,941
Then, why are you asking?

278
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:23,079
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

279
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,240
I'm just following regular procedures.

280
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,820
And this also shows my respect for you.

281
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,559
â™«  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  â™«

282
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,360
Thank you for your respect.

283
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,143
You can leave now that the draft's done.

284
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:40,083
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

285
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:44,327
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

286
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:48,497
â™«  I hear your heart whispering  â™«

287
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,704
â™«  Clouds that hang in the balance  â™«

288
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,851
â™«  Aloof but very sweet  â™«

289
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,319
â™«  I can't grasp it, so I take a deep breath  â™«

290
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,880
Good night, Mr. Shi. I'll friend you on WeChat when I get back.

291
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,599
â™«  Let flowing breaths fill my memory  â™«

292
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,759
I'll chat with you when you're bored.

293
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,181
I'm good at chatting and I've got many fun emojis.

294
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,119
I'm going to remind you one last time.

295
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,520
Your uncle won't be happy to see you at this hour.

296
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,900
I don't care I must find out who his girlfriend is.

297
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,860
My uncle never brought his girlfriend home.

298
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,000
I'd like to see who he's breaking the rules for.

299
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,659
Maybe when my uncle's happy enough in love, he won't force me to work.

300
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,499
That's odd. Shouldn't she be rewriting her draft like crazy?

301
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,079
Why is she here?

302
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,659
Who is she?

303
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,620
What?

304
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,880
My uncle won't allow me to reveal my identity.

305
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,759
Everyone knows you're one of the Guans.

306
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,419
I'm not getting involved with you.

307
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,519
Who's that girl?

308
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,540
She's the one I told you about; my super mean supervisor.

309
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,820
Do journalists nowadays all look so charming?

310
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,079
If I were you, I'd stay away from her.

311
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,400
My uncle doesn't like her.

312
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,839
He rejected her drafts several times.

313
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,580
Of course, it's mostly because my uncle loves me so much.

314
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,599
Where is she?

315
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,480
Where's the girl?

316
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,039
This colorâ€¦

317
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,940
I'm sure he invited a lady over.

318
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,319
What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to go home?

319
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,225
I've come to bring you some wine.

320
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
I should have sent you something this nice earlier.

321
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,519
I fear that if you get busy again you won't be able to visit grandpa and enjoy it.

322
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,559
Leave it, go home and rest.

323
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,359
Or else you might sleep in and be late for work.

324
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,219
Be a good worker and clock in on time.

325
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,480
Why didn't you let the lady stay?

326
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,399
What lady?

327
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:46,883
The lady you were drinking with just now.

328
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:50,119
It's so late. Why didn't you ask her to stay?

329
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,680
It's because she's not your type.

330
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,620
Or did she reject you?

331
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,580
Or you haven't been in a relationship for long so you're afraid?

332
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,260
What's wrong with Shi Yan?

333
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,799
I know.

334
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,519
That was my first confession in life.

335
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,459
He just threw me out after that.

336
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,319
That's too much!

337
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,580
Is he a man?

338
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,480
Now I'm sure he's a man.

339
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,279
But he's a childish man.

340
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,559
Childish?

341
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,720
Yeah, they say that a man remains a boy all his life.

342
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,680
Men are not straightforward animals.

343
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,799
Haven't you read those CEO romances?

344
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,359
The more a man loves you, the less likely he's going to admit it.

345
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,319
The more he likes you, the more he behaves like a bully.

346
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,594
That's Shi Yan for you!

347
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:54,219
Qin Shiyue, what's going on in your head?

348
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:57,060
You invited her over for a drink at this hour.

349
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,160
Then you sent her away immediately after that.

350
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,000
How cold.

351
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,999
Oh my god, are you a pervert?

352
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,499
You seem to be describing a pervert.

353
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:12,020
You could say so.

354
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,619
Just think about it.

355
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,440
Why else did he reject your drafts?

356
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,259
Because there were indeed problems with them.

357
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:23,659
That's part of it, of course.

358
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,959
But the key is that... he's trying to get your attention.

359
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,140
I'm sure he's interested in you.

360
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,819
I really admire your ungrounded confidence.

361
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:39,839
This is the conclusion that I have reached through countless practices.

362
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,900
As the saying goes, practice makes true knowledge.

363
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,920
His trick is old-fashioned but useful.

364
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,920
You see, he got you to confess to him.

365
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,593
Don't tell me you've fallen in love with him.

366
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,540
No way!

367
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,300
I'm just doing it for my interview.

368
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,160
It's you who asked me toâ€¦

369
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,960
Then why do I feel like there's something off?

370
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,119
You two met in private at night.

371
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,025
And you confessed to him for no reason.

372
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,519
Could it be that you've already had a crush on him without even realizing it?

373
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:23,128
Think about what I said.

374
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:24,940
Okay, that's all. I'm going home.

375
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,060
I have to work tomorrow.

376
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,599
Actually, I think he's interested in you, too.

377
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,839
If you're both interested in each other, what are you waiting for?

378
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,459
Strike while the iron is hot.

379
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,919
- See you. 
 - Bye.

380
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,640
Don't waste the food.

381
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,000
You need to learn from Guan Ji when it comes to dating.

382
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,960
Don't be a bore.

383
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,680
If you really like someone, you have to take the initiative.

384
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,100
When you invite her to your home, you should strike while the iron is hot.

385
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,599
Since you still have time for your wild imagination,

386
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,079
your job at the news agency must be easy.

387
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,240
How about this? Directly come work for me at Cloud Innovation.

388
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,799
How about this? Directly come work for me at Cloud Innovation.

389
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,920
This way you won't waste your energy.

390
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,919
Thank you but no.

391
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,180
Uncle, it's too late. Get some sleep.

392
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,179
Working at the news agency isn't easy at all.

393
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,599
I didn't get off work till after 8:00 p.m. today.

394
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,240
I've been working hard all day.

395
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,480
I have to go home and rest, too.

396
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,079
You won't earn my sympathy.

397
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,540
Andâ€¦

398
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,516
don't waste money on wine.

399
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,170
   

400
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:43,100
Shi Yan didn't forbid me from pursuing him.

401
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
So that's an indirect "yes"!

402
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,039
What are you waiting for?

403
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,000
   

404
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,039
You just don't want people to find you on WeChat, right, Mr. Shi?

405
00:31:05,584 --> 00:31:08,111
 I'm home. 

406
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:11,080
 Mr. Shi, are you still awake? 

407
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,250
 I'm sure you're busy. 

408
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,555
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

409
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:16,379
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

410
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:19,466
 All you have to do is read the first three words of the last message. 

411
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:21,616
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

412
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:24,200
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

413
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,880
This dialogue from online can express your feelings

414
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,758
without being too gross. This is just right.

415
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:31,887
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

416
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,939
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

417
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:37,839
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

418
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,720
 Cloudy to light rain tonight, 5~12Â°C 

419
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,100
 Overcast to cloudy tomorrow, 3~10Â°C 

420
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,359
 There will be rainy weather coming on working days. 

421
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,843
 Allow me to remind you to schedule your travels with care and stay warm. 

422
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:52,934
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

423
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:56,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

424
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,279
 You need to learn from Guan Ji when it comes to dating. 

425
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,279
 Don't be a bore. 

426
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,400
 If you really like someone, you have to take the initiative. 

427
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,939
 When you invite her to your home, you should strike while the iron is hot. 

428
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:22,896
   

429
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:25,060
   

430
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,163
â™«  The aftertaste of longing is like thoughts flying after the rain  â™«

431
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,589
â™«  Detouring towards you  â™«

432
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:34,055
â™«  Yet when we met, we only said empty words  â™«

433
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:37,598
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

434
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:40,944
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

435
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:42,584
   

436
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:44,759
Unsubscribe?

437
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,902
What's wrong with you, Shi Yan!

438
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:51,304
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

439
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:54,501
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

440
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:58,467
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

441
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:03,860
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

442
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,780
Mr. Shi, Le'an Technology just called.

443
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,519
They said they'd already seen our funding plan.

444
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,680
According to Mr. Chen, although the funding has certain guarantees for their future technology research and development,

445
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,819
there is still a big gap compared to Lieying's acquisition price at this stage.

446
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:23,300
They're concerned about the solutions to the technical problems you mentioned last time.

447
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,480
Mr. Shi, our last offer was the best we could manage.

448
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,160
The funding's been increased but it's no match for the acquisition price.

449
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,920
Will something bad happen if this goes on?

450
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,480
Thank you for the heads up. You can return to work now.

451
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,319
 You got a minute? Let's meet. 

452
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,980
- Good morning, Shuyi. 
 - Good morning, Shiyue.

453
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,260
What is it?

454
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,659
No, it's nothing.

455
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,480
Your lipstick looks good.

456
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,440
You can have it.

457
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,459
Iâ€¦

458
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,900
As I guessed, she's not.

459
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,900
She doesn't usually use that color.

460
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:12,800
Cloud Innovation seems to have rejected Zheng Shuyi's draft several times.

461
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,079
This has never happened to her before.

462
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,760
I guess she might've rubbed someone the wrong way again.

463
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,860
It's terrible to have a client who rejects your drafts without giving any reason.

464
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,119
 So my uncle's really my biological uncle. 

465
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:31,119
 But Zheng Shuyi is definitely not his girlfriend. 

466
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,159
 Who'd want to put their girlfriend through that on purpose? 

467
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,239
 Is he still a human being? 

468
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,939
 But my uncle might be just fine with this. 

469
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:44,159
 I feel like he is someone who can do such a thing. 

470
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:46,274
   

471
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,539
Zheng Shuyi, don't work so hard.

472
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:57,360
At least give us a break.

473
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:02,739
 The collaboration with the Guans is a key step for Cloud Innovation. 

474
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:05,660
 The Guans asked Yu You to come back at this point. 

475
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,039
 And Shi Yan went to his welcome dinner. 

476
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,079
You're already selecting the next topic?

477
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,180
Give us a break.

478
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,699
Have you settled Shi Yan's story?

479
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,639
Basically.

480
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,000
 Yu You's expert view should be important to the Guans' decision. 

481
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,599
 I should talk to him. 

482
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,460
 I'm sure I'll get a lot of useful information. 

483
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,170
 It's not hard to guess what Shi Yan wants to do. 

484
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,810
 But the key is how he plans to make his every move. 

485
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,119
 Our readers would be very interested in this. 

486
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:14,903
   

487
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:21,239
Impressive. All ten rings.

488
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,459
You did rock climbing last time and shooting this time.

489
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:30,260
You don't look like a college professor at all.

490
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,060
Then you donâ€™t look like a rich second generation either.

491
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,420
Actually, Bruce is also very special.

492
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,979
What do you mean?

493
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:43,940
The domestic market is vast. And your offer to Bruce is very attractive.

494
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,439
A lot of people are going to think it's a great opportunity.

495
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:51,280
But Bruce is an adventurer and challenger just like me.

496
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,760
So, salary and welfare aren't his top goals.

497
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,520
We need to think outside of the box.

498
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,499
He'll arrive next week. Have you figured out how to convince him?

499
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,360
What do you suggest?

500
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,860
You and I both like to do things that are fun and challenging.

501
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,600
Actually, Bruce's the same.

502
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,039
He's looking for both fun and challenges.

503
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,059
What brought you back from overseas?

504
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,519
Actually, the academic environment here is getting better and better.

505
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:28,105
And I get to meet people like you and Guan Ji.

506
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,439
Speaking of which you're a funny guy.

507
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,079
You like to seek challenges.

508
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,679
You could've accepted Mingyu Group's offer and made everyone happy.

509
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,500
Yet you chose to start your own company.

510
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,519
Isn't it fun enough working with you?

511
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,150
So I'm not making everyone happy.

512
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,280
But I'm one of the reasons why you came back,

513
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,350
I can convince Bruce, too.

514
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:55,920
And I'm confident. There's something in Chen Kang that can move Bruce.

515
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,137
   

516
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,416
Sorry, I have to take this.

517
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,419
Hello.

518
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,360
 Professor Yu, I'm Zheng Shuyi. 

519
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,599
 I hope you still remember me. 

520
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,320
Ms. Zheng, of course I remember you.

521
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,199
 Last time, we didn't get a chance to talk in detail. 

522
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,440
 Could we meet next week to go over some professional questions? 

523
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,039
Yeah, sure.

524
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,840
 I'll check my schedule and get back to you later. 

525
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,400
 Okay, thank you very much. 

526
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,820
Okay.

527
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,860
 Can I pursue you? 

528
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:47,360
Come. One more game.

529
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,579
I've finalized my article on the interview with Guan Ji.

530
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:54,060
We can move on to typesetting and printing.

531
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,139
Ms. Yi.

532
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,000
Ms. Yi, Mr. Shi has orally confirmed my draft.

533
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,820
He said Cloud Innovation would officially confirm it very soon.

534
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,960
Shuyi, I know you've been through a lot.

535
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,159
But you still have to take the overall situation into consideration when doing things.

536
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,360
Does it count if you say it verbally?

537
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,960
Headlines are not child's play.

538
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,619
There will be serious consequences should anything happen.

539
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,579
I have faith in my article. And Mr. Shi has promised me.

540
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:26,119
He will send an e-mail confirmation today.

541
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,840
What good is your confidence at this point?

542
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,159
What can you do if something goes wrong?

543
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,154
Are you going to resign and leave?

544
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,020
Since it's agreed that the confirmation will be sent today,

545
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,240
then let's wait till 12:00 tonight.

546
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,800
If we still haven't heard from Cloud Innovation or they haven't passed the draft,

547
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,760
we'll use Yuling's story for the headline.

548
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,540
I'm okay with it.

549
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,019
How about you?

550
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:50,920
I'm fine with that.

551
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,900
   

552
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,920
You seemed out of sorts just now.

553
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,939
It's not like you.

554
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,679
 Mr. Shi, help! 

555
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,719
 Yesterday, you passed my draft. 

556
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,180
 Please confirm it as soon as possible. 

557
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,480
Really? Let's play another round.

558
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,000
 Ms. Zheng, Mr. Shi is not with me today. 

559
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,559
 He should be busy with work. I can't reach him either. 

560
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,440
 I can't help you. 

561
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,840
It's so late.

562
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,880
If we don't pass, just tell us.

563
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,719
What are we waiting for here?

564
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:09,244
I'm sorry. We're journalists and we need to follow strict rules.

565
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:11,000
The rule says 12:00.

566
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,579
Not even a minute or a second will be lost.

567
