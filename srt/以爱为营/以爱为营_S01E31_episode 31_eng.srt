00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:32,140
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,565
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:38,640
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,240
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,865
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:48,365
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,651
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,990
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,065
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:59,240
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,565
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:06,465
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:09,525
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,985
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:16,340
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,240
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,315
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:36,065
   

21
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:39,051
   

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,398
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

23
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:50,425
â™«  But your eyes are avoiding me  â™«

24
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:53,719
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

 Take the plate of fish as Sister Shuyi.] 

26
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,779
 Uncle, she ate the stock. 

27
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:02,079
 Uncle, do you still love her? 

28
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,940
 You will lose her. 

29
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,540
 Uncle, did you check your WeChat? 

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,500
 That guy is sweet and thoughtful. And he is more proactive than you. 

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,895
â™«  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  â™«

32
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:20,915
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

33
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:24,602
â™«  But I'm afraid it's too late  â™«

34
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:29,716
â™«  I predicted the rain, but I pretend not to care  â™«

35
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,703
â€‹â™«  Lost in the night  â™«

â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

37
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:41,445
â™«  The courage to transcend time  â™«

38
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:44,995
â™«  Even I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

39
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:52,916
â™«  I'll let you know that I'm still where I am  â™«

40
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:09,125
â€‹â™«  Two stars in the night sky  â™«

41
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:13,033
â™«  Close yet far away  â™«

42
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:20,927
â™«  We don't need reasons to be determined  â™«

43
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:28,568
â™«  The memory of your embrace becomes clearer  â™«

44
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:31,180
â€‹â™«  I can no longer erase your traces  â™«

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,580
Seems like a fever.

46
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:39,595
â™«  ...from my heart  â™«

47
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,501
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

â™«  Even I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

54
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:15,098
â™«  I'll let you know that I haven't forgotten  â™«

55
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,182
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

56
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,764
â™«  But I'm afraid it's too late  â™«

57
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:33,805
â™«  I predicted the rain, but I pretend not to care  â™«

58
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,841
â™«  Lost in the night  â™«

â™«  I'll let you know that I haven't forgotten  â™«

63
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,100
Zheng Shuyi.

64
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Zheng Shuyi.

65
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:51,070
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

66
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:55,399
â™«  It's your shining eyes  â™«

67
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,800
â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

68
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:06,308
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

69
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:09,363
â™«  Luckily, you didn't go far away  â™«

70
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:16,080
â™«  I can still tightly hold your hand  â™«

71
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:23,950
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

72
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:31,025
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

73
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:36,023
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

74
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:44,457
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

75
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,460
Where are you going?

76
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,480
To the hospital, I'm sick.

77
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,279
Get in the car.

78
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:18,778
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

79
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:22,342
â™«  It's your shining eyes  â™«

80
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,800
â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

81
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,279
 What brought him here? 

82
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,800
 Does he want to see me? 

83
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,319
 He must have a reason. Anyway, this is not a coincidence. 

84
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:44,120
 But now, I don't think I have the right to ask. 

85
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,807
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

86
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:58,016
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

87
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:02,860
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

88
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:11,950
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

89
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:18,646
â™«  I want to do everything for you  â™«

90
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:25,950
â™«  I want to say I'm loving you every morning  â™«

91
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,811
â™«  You can only fall into my arms  â™«

92
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:38,760
â™«  No matter how windy, snowy, and cold it is, I will give you warmth  â™«

93
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,419
Nurse, the doctor said I just have a cold and fever.

94
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,980
Can I only get a fingertip blood test?

95
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,850
What do you think?

96
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:48,259
Clench your fist hard.

97
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,757
Okay, hold it like that.

98
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:28,322
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

99
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:32,402
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

100
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,240
You're a grown-up. Why cry over a blood test?

101
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,998
â™«  To travel through this long time with you  â™«

102
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:48,260
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

103
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:55,530
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

104
00:09:57,147 --> 00:10:00,279
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

105
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,140
What were you crying about just now?

106
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,180
I wasn't crying. I was justâ€¦

107
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,190
I wasn't crying. I was justâ€¦

108
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,480
 I was just thinking that if nothing had happened on that day 

109
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,939
 I'd be with you watching the stars now. 

110
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:20,320
I didn't expect to be in the hospital at this time.

111
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,720
I know.

112
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,719
Yeah, otherwise you'd be at my house now.

113
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,320
 Did I hear that wrong? 

114
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,510
 But there's nothing confusing about this simple sentence at all. 

115
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,408
 Why is he suddenly saying this now? 

116
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:35,200
â™«  We were all shining stars  â™«

117
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,399
Iâ€¦

118
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,612
Am I wrong?

119
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:44,480
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

120
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,890
You're right.

121
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,360
â™«  We were all shining stars  â™«

122
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,120
 Ms. Zheng Shuyi, please come to the laboratory to get your test reports. 

123
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,676
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

124
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:02,417
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

125
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:11,580
â™«  No matter how this fate started  â™«

126
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,080
Today's scenery seems even more beautiful.

127
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,940
Yes, it is.

128
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,340
This place means a lot to me.

129
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,620
That's why I wanted to come here with you again today.

130
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,700
I like this place, too.

131
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,234
   

132
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,200
What's with him?

133
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,399
He hasn't responded after all this time.

134
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,900
Shiyue, actually, Iâ€¦

135
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,600
Do you want to know what gift I've prepared for you?

136
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,899
You prepared a gift for me? What is it?

137
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,797
   

138
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,719
These are books for students preparing for graduate entrance exams. They're not quite suitable for you.

139
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:22,240
I have many suitable books for you at home. I'll fetch you some later.

140
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,640
What a silly head!

141
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,140
I'm preparing for the on-job graduate program at the University of Finance and Economics.

142
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,480
I wonder if my boyfriend has time to help me with my study.

143
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,039
Really?

144
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,359
Of course, I have time.

145
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,840
Then have you prepared a gift for me?

146
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,400
Why are you giving me this?

147
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,879
Because may name means "to drift."

148
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,008
I used to drift like a boat...

149
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,039
until I met you.

150
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,090
You made my heart settle down.

151
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,700
You gave me a feeling of wanting to stay.

152
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,740
That's like dropping anchor.

153
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,850
Then you can't travel far?

154
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,899
Just kidding. Put it on for me.

155
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,779
Does it look good?

156
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,440
It does.

157
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,599
This is what I owe my girlfriend.

158
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:34,080
Your white blood cell count is a bit high but it's not a serious problem.

159
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,880
I'll prescribe some medicine for you. Take it on time.

160
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,679
If your temperature hasn't gone down tomorrow morning, come back for an IV.

161
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,020
- Remember to rest well. 
 - Sure.

162
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,599
You can go.

163
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,038
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

164
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:33,013
â™«  But your eyes are avoiding me  â™«

165
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,080
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

166
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,879
Why are you so silent?

167
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,301
It's nothing.

168
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,740
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

169
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,693
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

170
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:58,020
â™«  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  â™«

171
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,739
 Brother Shi Yan, are you available tomorrow? 

172
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,400
 What's up? 

173
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,799
I have good news!

174
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,460
I found a few experts in chip technology. They've given me some ideas.

175
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,559
 Since tomorrow is a holiday, I'd like to meet you to discuss it. 

176
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,120
 Brother Shi Yan, will you come out with me tomorrow? 

177
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,060
 If not, I'll go to find you at your place. 

178
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,800
You have plenty of free time.

179
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,340
Just kidding.

180
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,879
Brother Shi Yan, will you dine out with me tomorrow?

181
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,759
Didn't you say it was about work?

182
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,179
You're awake?

183
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,219
Are you going tomorrow?

184
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,059
Did you hear it?

185
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,240
A bit.

186
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,200
You seem to mind?

187
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,119
It's not like that.

188
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm just asking.

189
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,719
So, do you want me to go?

190
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,039
Of course, I don't want you to go.

191
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,780
Zheng Shuyi,

192
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,140
in what capacity are you saying this?

193
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,240
Because according to the almanac one shouldn't go out tomorrow.

194
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,680
There could be a major disaster.

195
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,680
Go home and rest.

196
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,240
It's true. Be careful tomorrow.

197
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,820
Hello.

198
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,860
 Hello, Sister Shuyi, are you busy? 

199
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,780
No.

200
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,419
I've recovered now. I want to go back to work.

201
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,399
Has your uncle agreed?

202
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:37,200
I haven't asked him yet. He's been too busy to bother with me lately.

203
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,039
 Let's go for dinner after work today! 

204
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,739
Not today, I'm sick.

205
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:47,319
Are you okay? Is it serious?

206
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,879
It's nothing, just a bit of a fever.

207
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,300
 Have you seen a doctor? 

208
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,799
I'm in the hospital on an IV.

209
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,920
You're on an IV and it's not serious? Is there anyone with you?

210
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,580
It's a minor issue.

211
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,590
I'm calling the nurse, I'll hang up now.

212
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,839
Okay, take care.

213
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,779
Say what you have to say.

214
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:48,428
Shuyi's very sick. She's on an IV and she's alone, helpless, and with no one to care for her.

215
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:50,891
I feel so bad for her.

216
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm done eating.

217
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:43,370
â™«  Trying my best to light up myself so that I can shine on you  â™«

218
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:50,540
â™«  To travel through this long time with you  â™«

219
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:59,290
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

220
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:06,390
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

221
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:15,500
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

222
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:17,942
Don't move!

223
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:21,419
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

224
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:26,292
You came to the hospital alone for an IV. And you have the guts to fall asleep.

225
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,239
Why are you here? Didn't I tell you not to come out?

226
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,210
Aren't you the biggest disaster in my life?

227
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,066
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

228
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:44,460
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

229
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,999
How can a couple act all lovey-dovey even in the hospital?

230
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,279
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

231
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,919
Was I too loud?

232
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,665
Sorry, go on.

233
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:03,980
â™«  Maybe, we are still shining stars  â™«

234
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,201
Are you leaving or not??

235
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,606
â™«   Reunited after being released from brave loneliness   â™«

236
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:13,380
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

237
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,013
Thanks for your clothes..

238
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:19,013
â™«  We will run forward with all of our might, shining brightly  â™«

239
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:23,179
 Don't take it. Let me keep wearing it. 

240
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,960
Are you planning to stay here?

241
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,139
I feel heavy-headed and can't walk.

242
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,119
Here we go again.

243
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:18,066
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

244
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:21,580
â™«  It's your shining eyes  â™«

245
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,882
â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

246
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:32,510
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

247
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,400
Zheng Shuyi,

248
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,200
do you think your tricks always work on me?

249
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,499
Don't call me by my full name. It sounds scary.

250
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,300
Zheng Shuyi, don't change the subject.

251
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,939
I didn't mean it that way.

252
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:52,159
I dare not? I'm just very fragile.

253
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,139
Keep acting.

254
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:56,340
I'm not acting.

255
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,950
Actually, I wasn't deceiving you the whole time.

256
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,540
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

257
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,340
For a long time after I met you I was indeed acting.

258
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,939
But later, it all became a habit.

259
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:17,699
Every time I see you, I act like that.

260
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,240
I don't know when these changes started.

261
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,459
I don't even know if it still counts as acting.

262
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:31,680
I don't even know when my fake feelings turned real.

263
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,899
I also don't know when I started falling for you.

264
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,880
Shi Yan,

265
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,440
although our relationship started with lies because of me,

266
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,297
but I really like you.

267
00:25:45,297 --> 00:25:47,259
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

268
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,920
I want a perfect ending with you.

269
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,570
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

270
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,257
Oh!

271
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,739
Oh?

272
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:02,379
What's that supposed to mean??

273
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:04,699
Do you believe me or not? Say something.

274
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:06,269
What do you mean by "Oh"?

275
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:11,412
â™«  I want to do everything for you  â™«

276
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:18,350
â™«  I want to say I'm loving you every morning  â™«

277
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,901
I mean "it depends on your performance."

278
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:32,450
â™«  No matter how windy, snowy, and cold it is, I will give you warmth  â™«

279
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:40,810
â€‹â™«  I will give you warmth  â™«

280
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,539
I don't know how I'm supposed to perform.

281
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,480
How about you give me some hints?

282
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,880
Or it'd be performing on a stage without wearing a proper costume.

283
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,820
No costume?

284
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,540
You going to take off your clothes?

285
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,199
Forget it. No filthy flirting now. I didn't mean that.

286
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,839
Zheng Shuyi.

287
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,839
What is it again?

288
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,000
Did you forget something?

289
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,060
What did I forget?

290
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,020
Think about it.

291
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,079
I forgot to thank you for taking me home.

292
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:52,939
 I know it's raining but I'm waiting for my boyfriend. 

293
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:56,400
 That's right, I have a boyfriend. Take care, thank you. 

294
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,179
What are you gawking at?

295
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:20,820
Nothing. I just remembered the first time we metâ€¦

296
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,900
I actually refused your offer to take me home.

297
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,839
Feels like I missed the whole world.

298
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,060
Who told you that was our first meeting?

299
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:37,439
Was our first meeting way back?

300
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:40,259
Could it be when I was in college?

301
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,219
It can't be earlier. I only came to Jiangcheng for college.

302
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,200
- What? 
 - Go home.

303
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:55,980
Tell me. I can't remember.

304
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,540
If you can't remember, let it go.

305
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,519
 Shuyi, are you feeling better? 

306
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,859
 I'm fine, thanks for today. 

307
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,980
 Thank me for what? 

308
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,940
 Nothing, just thanks for your concern. 

309
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,739
 No need to be so polite. 

310
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:34,479
 So, are you going back to work? 

311
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,820
 I've got nothing to do at home so I'm returning to work tomorrow. 

312
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:49,499
Just now in the car, did Shi Yan mean that I removed him from my friend list?

313
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,519
No, that's definitely not the case.

314
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,160
He would've only found it out if he'd tried to message me.

315
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,960
And if he'd found out, he wouldn't have brought it up so calmly.

316
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,799
 Shiyue, give me your uncle's WeChat ID. 

317
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,960
 I thought you already had it. 

318
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,899
 I accidentally deleted it. 

319
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,659
 I'm not a three-year-old anymore. I won't buy your story. 

320
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,580
 How drunk were you to accidentally delete him? 

321
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,960
 Don't ask. 

322
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,360
   

323
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:50,765
   

324
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,157
   

325
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:57,947
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

326
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,640
 Are you idle? 

327
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:08,119
 No, I'm seriously considering something. And I'd like to ask you a question. 

328
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,767
 Ask away. 

329
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:16,039
 What's your ideal type of girlfriend? 

330
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,419
â™«  Blooming roses, gorgeous yet wither  â™«

331
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:24,403
 Quiet, serious, solemn. 

332
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:28,399
â™«  Roses reveal a hidden ambiguity  â™«

333
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,819
 Zheng Shuyi, Journalist of Financial Introduce, is a quiet and serious lady. Her writing style is solemn. 

334
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:37,553
 I think I'm your ideal type. 

335
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:45,218
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

336
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,298
 Are you? 

337
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:52,095
â™«  Echoing in the smoke, falling into sweet madness  â™«

338
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:58,235
   

339
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:03,916
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

340
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:07,076
Did I use to talk like this?

341
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,658
I shouldn't have used the flirting techniques from the internet.

342
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:16,979
â™«  Then waving against the strong wind  â™«

343
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:20,759
 Stop. No more chat history! Unsubscribe 

344
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,419
â™«  Writing down the appearance of your dreams  â™«

345
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:29,139
 If you keep sending these tomorrow, you'll see news about a young beauty falling to her death. 

346
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:33,224
â™«  Blooming roses, carrying the fragrance of thorns  â™«

347
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:38,428
 So you don't want me to show you how you acted quiet, serious, and solemn? 

348
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,676
I can't keep going.

349
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:53,486
â™«  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  â™«

350
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:56,880
What is Mr. Shi thinking? Are we going bankrupt?

351
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,600
Then I should quickly update my resume. What's the situation now?

352
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,780
Shi Yan, take my advice.

353
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,259
You'd better give up on Le'an Tech.

354
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,820
If you keep insisting on this,

355
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,980
you will not only lose people's support, but also shake the foundations of Cloud Innovation.

356
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,900
Uncle Tian,

357
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,540
this is indeed the most difficult time for Le'an Tech.

358
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,359
But it's not the end of the road. As a partner, it's heartless to give up halfway.

359
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:39,820
As an investor, giving up now at a loss is not the best choice.

360
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,879
Shi Yan, do you mean that we're heartless and dumb?

361
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:47,139
Absolutely not. I totally understand the both of you.

362
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:49,380
I don't need your understanding.

363
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,939
Anyway, I've never believed in some last-minute miracle bullshit.

364
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:56,799
You're asking me to pay for things that I know are wrong. Iâ€¦

365
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,799
I can't do it.

366
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,860
Then, what about this?

367
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,920
Regardless of the outcome of Le'an Tech,

368
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,920
I will pay you and Mr. Zhang as projected in the investment report.

369
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,500
Shi Yan, you're not young anymore.

370
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,140
You're the CEO. CEO Shi.

371
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,079
We can't act on impulse in business.

372
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,920
And you can't have your father cover for you when things get out of control.

373
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,559
Besides, Zhang and I care about more than just that bit of money.

374
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,639
Thank you, Mr. Tian and Mr. Zhang for your understanding.

375
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,340
Chen Kang and I will resolve this issue as soon as possible.

376
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,390
   

377
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,475
   

378
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,839
You're back.

379
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,519
Let me see if you've gotten haggard.

380
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,519
Did you really have a fever? How come you look even more radiant now?

381
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,540
Someone healed me like a good doctor.

382
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,400
Shuyi.

383
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,860
Yi Yang.

384
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,639
I heard you were sick a few days ago.

385
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,960
You should be all right now. Right?

386
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,000
You look radiant now. You're even prettier than before.

387
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,460
Yi Yang, I have something to tell you.

388
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,660
Would I have the honor to invite you to have dinner with me and talk then?

389
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,800
Sure.

390
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,239
Do I have something on my face?

391
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,000
I always feel like you look different.

392
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,900
You seemed to have closed yourself off previously.

393
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,380
Every day you looked gloomy, like it was about to rain.

394
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,919
Now, it's like the sky has cleared after the rain.

395
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:28,080
Is it because of Shi Yan?

396
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,439
- We're getting back together. 
 - Getting back together?

397
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,559
Men like Shi Yanâ€¦ They're successful and sophisticated.

398
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,239
They always stay vigilant and calm.

399
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,020
You two had such a serious fall-out. How could he easily let it go?

400
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:53,360
 Yeah. Men like Shi Yan would definitely not easily forgive someone's deceit. 

401
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,159
 But he forgave me so easily and keeps indulging me. 

402
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,420
Shuyi, I won't give up.

403
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,499
I will defeat Shi Yan in business and in love.

404
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:08,420
Wait and see.

405
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:13,700
I came today to tell you thatâ€¦

406
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,000
Whether I reconcile with Shi Yan or not, there's no chance for us.

407
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,740
Even if you don't give up, I won't change my mind.

408
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,379
One never loves someone because they are good.

409
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:27,700
Love isn't about comparison.

410
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,279
You just thinkyour love's good in every respect.

411
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
I feel the same about you.

412
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,200
Zheng Shuyi, loving you is my business.

413
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,839
You don't need to feel burdened by my feelings.

414
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,052
If you feel you can't accept me for now,

415
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:47,708
I still hope that we can continue to meet, have meals

416
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:50,512
and try interesting things together.

417
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,080
Better not.

418
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm afraid my boyfriend would mind.

419
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,000
Xingzhou, what has been wrong with you lately? Clients are coming to me.

420
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,199
Hurry up and go apologize to them in person.

421
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,760
Yes.

422
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,180
- Hello, Lezhi. 
  - Xingzhou. 

423
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,899
 I've spoken to human resources, they've arranged an interview for you in a few days. 

424
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:31,359
- Really? 
  - Prepare well. I'm sure you can pass. 

425
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,940
Don't worry. I will do my best.

426
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,920
- Lezhi, thank you. 
  - Xingzhou 

427
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,239
 I'm so good to you. So, you have to be nice to me in the future. 

428
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:45,320
Lezhi, I will definitely be nice to you for the rest of my life.

429
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,090
How long has it been since we last had a drink together?

430
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,160
Quite a while.

431
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,840
Yeah.

432
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,640
You've had your plans. And I've had mine.

433
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,200
You're happier than me. I still have to work.

434
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,399
When you were little, I separated from your mother.

435
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:23,079
I was always busy working and didn't care enough for you.

436
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,900
Then I handed the responsibility over to you, and you got busy.

437
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,410
As parents, we didn't talk with you.

438
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,890
Not doing enough, not doing it well.

439
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:36,700
So you're lacking when it comes to relationships.

440
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,480
Look. You've never been in a serious relationship.

441
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,500
That's nonsense. I'm fine now.

442
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,779
I'm doing well with Shanshan.

443
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:50,400
I love freedom just like you.

444
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,939
I love being unrestrained.

445
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:54,880
So I don't know how to love and be loved.

446
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,579
But after meeting Shanshan, I suddenly understood what I wanted.

447
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,519
And I became more determined. We are serious about each other.

448
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:08,619
So, I will work hard and also be serious about my relationship.

449
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,500
Good. That's good.

450
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,340
Tell me about you.

451
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,119
How's Ms. Tang?

452
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,760
Sheâ€¦

453
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,900
She's always hesitant.

454
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:32,039
She never wants to get involved with my friends or my family.

455
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,620
Remember how she avoided you both the other day at the riding club?

456
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,999
Sheâ€¦

457
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,060
Could it be because of me?

458
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,239
Maybe I can talk to her?

459
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,360
Okay.

460
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:51,785
   

461
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,239
Hello.

462
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,420
What?

463
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,900
Are you okay now?

464
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,319
Don't move. I'll be right there.

465
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,900
It's all swollen.

466
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,440
No biggie. It's nothing serious.

467
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,980
The bathroom was too slippery, so I fell accidentally while taking a shower.

468
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,519
Later, get some ice and apply it to the wound.

469
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,319
- Are you sure you're okay? 
 - I'm fine.

470
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,080
It's not serous.

471
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:43,159
Really, you need to be careful.

472
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,060
I really want to be by your side.

473
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,480
So we can take care of each other.

474
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,480
Guan Ji wants to talk to you.

475
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,840
Guan Ji?

476
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,280
Are you okay with it?

477
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,540
I'll think about it.

478
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,180
I'll get you some ice.

479
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,860
Shuyi, what are you doing?

480

 "Passerby" - Zhou Shen 

482
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:47,720
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

483
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:54,549
â™«  Can a happy ending be fixed?  â™«

484
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:58,120
â™«  Meeting you, approaching you  â™«

485
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,108
â™«  Falling in love with you, losing you  â™«

486
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:09,535
â™«  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  â™«

487
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:15,927
â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

488
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:21,616
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

489
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:28,074
â™«  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  â™«

490
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:30,358
â™«  Does it hurt  â™«

491
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:36,571
â™«  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  â™«

492
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:43,697
â™«  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  â™«

493
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:51,811
â™«  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  â™«

494
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,678
â™«  Do you want to let go like this?  â™«

495
00:45:05,678 --> 00:45:07,892
â™«  Does it hurt  â™«

496
00:45:07,892 --> 00:45:14,126
â™«  We're clearly already trapped in quicksand  â™«

497
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:20,734
â™«  Don't say you were never afraid  â™«

498
00:45:22,948 --> 00:45:27,606
â™«  Don't say you can let go  â™«

499
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:32,012
â™«  Don't go far, okay?  â™«
