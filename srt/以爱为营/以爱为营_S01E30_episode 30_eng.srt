00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,625
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,675
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,888
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,325
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,699
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,950
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,125
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,550
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,585
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,945
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,200
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,250
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,011
   

22
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,760
What are you thinking?

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,799
I've never seen you like this before.

24
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,899
I don't know.

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,799
I knew you would come.

26
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,099
I'm here to return your skateboard.

27
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,139
Shuyi, do you have to be such a bummer?

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,220
Don't you want to know what happened that day?

29
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,744
I will tell you

30
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:56,839
if you can skateboard up there.

31
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,580
 Can you tell me now? 

32
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,120
 You cursed Shi Yan. He got angry and took you away. 

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,919
 What next? 

34
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,599
 That's all. 

35
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,680
 It's been days. 

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,240
 What do I want? 

37
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
   

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
If I can't see Shi Yan,

39
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,940
then I won't believe that I can't ask Luo Hao out.

40
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,400
Guess who I am.

41
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,319
Fiona, when did you return home?

42
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,380
Brother Shi Yan, you're still so good.

43
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,940
I didn't tell you I was back, but you knew it was me.

44
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,120
Did you miss me?

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,879
Why didn't you tell Yue you were back?

46
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,120
I asked Yue not to tell you. She didn't agree.

47
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,340
But she agreed after I told her that I would surprise you.

48
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,400
Look. I came to see you as soon as I landed.

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,120
Are you surprised?

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,780
Do you have any plans?

51
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,399
Of course, I want to come to Cloud Innovation to help you.

52
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,580
I've heard a little bit about Cloud Innovation.

53
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,400
My dad and Mr. Zhang don't support you. But I do.

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
I came back specifically to help you.

55
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,540
Feifei.

56
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,340
Dad.

57
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,500
- Dad. 
 - Don't call me Dad.

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,419
Feifei, you are so naughty.

59
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,079
You ran away as soon as you landed.

60
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,176
Do you value me?

61
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,460
Dad, you are the most important in my eyes.

62
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,860
Look! I came to Cloud Innovation to see you as soon as I landed.

63
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,619
I haven't seen Brother Shi Yan for a long time, so I came to talk with him.

64
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,439
It would be weird if I were believe what you say.

65
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:26,799
Shi Yan, I am sorry that Feifei bothered you.

66
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:30,959
Mr. Tian, no worries. I think of Fiona as my sister.

67
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,820
What are you goingâ€¦

68
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,800
Shi Yan, please send Feifei home later.

69
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,399
Okay.

70
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,520
We'll settle it when you get home.

71
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,499
Dad, bye-bye.

72
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,199
Brother Shi Yan, what can I do for you?

73
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,500
 Zheng Shuyi, look up. 

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,279
 Your eyes are big, but not sharp. 

75
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,900
 Are you from Savory Noodles? 

76
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,580
 Yes. It must be your boyfriend who ordered it. 

77
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,000
 Your boyfriend is thoughtful. He talked to me on the phone for ten minutes. 

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,159
 He told me how to choose a thermal box. And he told me how to put the noodles in it. 

79
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,525
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

80
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,780
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

81
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,939
 What do I do? 

82
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:51,296
 I love him, but we can't be together. 

83
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,140
 Since you love each other, why can't you talk it out? 

84
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,400
 Don't you feel regret if you give up? 

85
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,725
â™«  ...left me where I was standing  â™«

86
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,680
â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

87
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,140
Miss, it's Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

88
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,475
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

89
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,120
 Talk it out in person. 

90
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,719
There's nothing you can't talk about in person.

91
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,381
â™«  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  â™«

92
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:36,880
â™«  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  â™«

93
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,175
â™«  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  â™«

94
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:47,400
â™«  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  â™«

95
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,199
â™«  Do you want to let go like this?  â™«

96
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,819
Miss, will you get out?

97
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,340
I can't stay here.

98
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,739
Let's go.

99
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,959
Did you come here to take a look?

100
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,520
â™«  Don't say you were never afraid  â™«

101
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:22,500
â™«  Don't say you can let go  â™«

102
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,590
â™«  Don't go far, okay?  â™«

103
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,140
Buy me a cup of milk tea. I will tell you a piece of gossip.

104
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,820
No.

105
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,340
It's about Shi Yan.

106
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,860
Shi Yan's childhood crush came back yesterday.

107
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,460
She went to Cloud Innovation as soon as she landed. She talked to Shi Yan late into the night.

108
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,560
I heard she would go to Cloud Innovation to help Shi Yan.

109
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,480
Is the milk tea worth it?

110
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:14,400
Itâ€¦ has nothing to do with me.

111
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,139
Right.

112
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,000
But you said "Only by knowing your interviewees deeply

113
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,399
can you write a profound interview."

114
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,559
What a pretty pony.

115
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,900
You can give it a name.

116
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,000
- Really? 
 - Yes.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,200
We will watch this foal grow up together.

118
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,619
It can be ridden when it grows up.

119
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:56,820
It will give birth to foals. And we will be together forever.

120
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,800
Have you decided what to call it?

121
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,499
I will call it Yu Gong.

122
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,540
"Generation after generation, my offspring are endless."

123
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,719
Okay, your call.

124
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:29,180
The foals born this time are lovely.

125
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,400
You will love them.

126
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,939
Come on.

127
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,459
Dad.

128
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,239
You haven't seen foals so small. Right?

129
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,500
Ms. Bi, do you mind if I call you Shanshan, too?

130
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Finally, someone's taking care of you.

131
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,759
He is a good man.

132
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,340
Shi Yan will be here soon. After riding, we can eat together, Ms. Tang.

133
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,940
No, thanks.

134
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,740
Mr. Guan said a foal was born.

135
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,559
I was curious, so he brought me here. I have plans tonight.

136
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,400
I hope you enjoy it.

137
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,540
Excuse me.

138
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,059
I will send her back.

139
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:44,120
I don't want to bother you.

140
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,079
Shanshan, enjoy yourself.

141
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,140
- Let's go, Ms. Tang. 
 - See you.

142
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,599
- See you. 
 - See you.

143
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,320
You could have stayed.

144
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,940
Sorry, Old Guan.

145
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,980
I am not ready for that.

146
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,039
Don't say sorry.

147
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:34,220
I wonder why the skies turned black.

148
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,120
It turned out that your best friend who blocks people came.

149
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,020
Shanshan, I can vouch for Shi Yan's character.

150
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,919
He is the victim here.

151
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,960
Shanshan, Shi Yan cares about Ms. Zheng.

152
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,173
Yeah.

153
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,939
He blocked Shuyi.

154
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:59,779
He accepted Xu Yuling to take over the interview.

155
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,419
He entangled himself with other women.

156
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,240
I haven't.

157
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,719
Shanshan,

158
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,980
you told me that Ms. Zheng didn't let go of Shi Yan.

159
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,559
And Shi Yan loves Ms. Zheng.

160
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,939
How about this? You tell Shi Yan what to do.

161
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:18,759
He will listen to you.

162
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,820
From the beginning, I only loved Zheng Shuyi.

163
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,270
See?

164
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,920
Shanshan, talk to Ms. Zheng for him.

165
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,480
No.

166
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,252
This is between me and Zheng Shuyi.

167
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,279
We should solve it ourselves.

168
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,739
 Oh my god! Two shareholders of Cloud Innovation want to withdraw their shares. 

169
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,779
 Who are they? I heard some shareholders have been unhappy with Shi Yan. 

170
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,160
 Le'an is at stake. Cloud Innovation is in a turbulent time. 

171
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,020
 Will Shi Yan go to his dad? 

172
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,069
What's the matter with you? You go to Cloud Innovation every day.

173
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:20,860
Why don't you know anything about it?

174
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,520
Tell me! What do we do?

175
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,236
I am sorry, Chief Editor. It's my fault.

176
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,500
Come on. It's useless to say that.

177
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,419
I want a remedy.

178
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:37,960
In the next issue, we must publish an in-depth report on it.

179
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,860
We've been working with Cloud Innovation for a long time.

180
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,758
If we can't publish an in-depth report on it, we'll be the joke of the industry.

181
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,720
I understand, Chief Editor.

182
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,085
You don't have to follow this feature.

183
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:52,000
Then who will?

184
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,039
Chief Editor wants you.

185
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,019
Chief Editor wants you.

186
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,760
Shuyi, the lead editor and I want you to follow this feature.

187
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,328
Put aside your personal feelings.

188
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:30,440
If Xu Yuling brought back any valuable information,

189
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,819
I wouldn't force you to go.

190
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,798
It's a critical moment for Cloud Innovation.

191
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:38,900
It's also a critical moment for Cloud Innovation's feature

192
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,279
and the upgrading of the e-newsletter.

193
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,820
Now,

194
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,880
your feature may witness a big event.

195
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,940
 Shi Yan must be having a hard time. 

196
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,200
Shuyi, think about it.

197
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,660
Think about your dream.

198
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,799
Think about your ambition to upgrade the e-newsletter.

199
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:06,280
Thank you for allowing to follow this feature again.

200
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,120
I'll try my best to do this in-depth report.

201
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:27,120
Mr. Chen, thank you.

202
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,914
Ms. Zheng, no worries.

203
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:33,379
I think Mr. Shi wanted to meet you.

204
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:03,700
â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«

205
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,059
Shiâ€¦.

206
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,175
â™«  Can a happy ending be fixed?  â™«

207
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,659
â™«  Meeting you, approaching you  â™«

208
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,800
Mr. Shi.

209
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,750
â™«  Falling in love with you, losing you  â™«

210
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:26,150
â™«  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  â™«

211
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,580
â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

212
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,190
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

213
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,651
â™«  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  â™«

214
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:46,960
Iâ€¦

215
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,939
â™«  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  â™«

216
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,540
Mr. Shi.

217
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,279
Thank you for your time.

218
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,800
About Cloud Innovation's recent situation, I want the featureâ€¦

219
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,659
Zheng Shuyi,

220
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,319
is that why you came to me??

221
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,559
I can't tell you anything about Cloud Innovation.

222
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,680
Ms. Zheng, you may leave.

223
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,650
â™«  Not only did I lie to you,   â™«

224
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,700
â™«  but I also lied to myself  â™«

225
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,216
â™«  Otherwise, how could you ignore the scenery along the way?  â™«

226
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:42,970
â™«  Approaching you, avoiding you, loving you from a distance  â™«

227
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:50,250
â™«  Falling into a predicament, unwilling to sober up  â™«

228
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,820
â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

229
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,480
Mr. Shi.

230
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,840
Have they gone?

231
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,400
No.

232
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,900
Where are they?

233
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,919
The reporters are waiting downstairs.

234
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,119
â™«  Does it hurt  â™«

235
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,140
â™«  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  â™«

236
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,279
Come with me.

237
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,963
â™«  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  â™«

238
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:22,440
But you didn't make a deal with Mr. Tian.

239
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:28,150
â™«  Don't say you can let go  â™«

240
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,875
â™«  Don't go far, okay?  â™«

241
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,071
Here comes Mr. Shi.

242
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,160
Interview him.

243
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,520
Mr. Shi, could you tell us about the situation of Cloud Innovation?

244
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,579
Mr. Shi, do you regret investing in Le'an Technology?

245
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,300
Mr. Shi, are there changes in Cloud Innovation's top management?

246
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,760
Will there be a change in management?

247
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,060
Mr. Shi, will those two shareholders quit?

248
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,360
There's something in Cloud Innovation. We need to discuss and solve it.

249
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,800
But there is no conclusion yet. I'm not in a position to give any details.

250
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,080
Mr. Shi, what is your opinion on the withdrawal of the two shareholders?

251
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,139
Cloud Innovation and I can't stand people and things that are not pure in the process of working.

252
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,702
It's normal to encounter problems and different opinions.

253
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:32,440
We should seek common ground while reserving differences and face solutions together instead of just walking away.

254
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,520
That's all. Thank you.

255
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,399
 - Excuse us. 
 - Mr. Shi, say more. 

256
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:45,759
 - Mr. Shi. 
 - Mr. Shi. Please say more. 

257
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,420
- Okay, I see. Put it on my desk. I have to go. 
 - All right, Ms. Yuling.

258
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,340
I am sorry.

259
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,079
Are you all right?

260
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,100
Shuyi.

261
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,980
Shuyi, what happened?

262
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,200
Shuyi, are you all right?

263
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,740
Shuyi, did I hurt you?

264
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,999
Xu Yuling.

265
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,779
What did you do?

266
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:32,380
I didn't do anything. We collided with each other.

267
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,940
Shuyi, seriously? Why are you crying?

268
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,979
Are you all right?

269
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:41,219
I am all right. You go ahead.

270
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:43,640
Are you sure?

271
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,559
Shuyi.

272
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,620
I am fine. I will work on my manuscript. You go ahead.

273
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:28,905
   

274
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:31,450
   

275
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,310
   

276
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,900
   

277
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,275
â™«  A cool night at twilight  â™«

278
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,525
â™«  A red candle beside me for warmth  â™«

279
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:19,100
â™«  Every passing scene is all related to you  â™«

280
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,400
â™«  My heart harbors no regret  â™«

281
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,600
 Mr. Shi, what do you want to eat? I will prepare it for you. 

282
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:41,850
â™«  I never look back  â™«

283
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:45,800
â™«  Raindrops dance on eaves  â™«

284
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,947
â™«  The place where I suddenly look back  â™«

285
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:56,867
â™«  There you are, amidst dimming lights  â™«

286
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:03,000
â™«  I am destined to be with you  â™«

287
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,499
 Are you sure you don't want it? 

288
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:08,480
 Their seafood noodles are savory. 

289
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,479
 It tastes great and keeps you interested. 

290
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:16,251
â™«  I wish there were no partings in this world  â™«

291
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:20,425
â™«  May the drifting boat dock to its shore  â™«

292
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:29,050
â™«  May lovers eventually reach perfection  â™«

293
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,850
â™«  And never change in this life  â™«

294
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,900
 We didn't look at the stars together on Spring Festival's Eve. 

295
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,359
 Let's do it now. 

296
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,520
 Cloudy, rainy, and sunny, 

297
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,100
 I want to be your baby. 

298
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,960
 After getting to know you, I found that you are handsome, talented, capable, 

299
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,739
 and the dream lover of many women in Jiangcheng. 

300
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,599
 I am also one of them. 

301
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,540
 So, I couldn't help myself by getting close to you. 

302
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,165
 I'm happy to see you. 

303
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:13,380
 Now you have me. I will always be there for you. 

304
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,179
 Succeed or fail, I will be there with you. 

305
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,900
 When I am done, I will meet you this weekend. 

306
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,440
 The Shi family's little Yan is very clingy. 

307
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,800
 I don't know the meaning of the book, Jiangcheng is far away. 

308
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,679
 The Shi family's little Yan is jealous of snow. 

309
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:37,575
â™«  Love rings are exchanged on the ring fingers  â™«

310
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:41,527
â™«  I wish there were no partings in this world  â™«

311
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:45,625
    
 â™«  May the drifting boat dock to its shore  â™«

312
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:54,250
â™«  May lovers eventually reach perfection  â™«

313
00:25:55,925 --> 00:26:02,968
â™«  And never change in this life  â™«

314
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:05,140
   

315
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:45,120
Hello, guys.

316
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,119
Hello.

317
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,940
Why are you here so early today?

318
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,860
Because it's time to work on a new life goal.

319
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,820
New life goal? What is that?

320
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,680
It's time for class.

321
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,920
Okay. Please turn to page 163.

322
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,400
Today we're going to talk about the valuation of securities.

323
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,560
Okay. That's all for today. Break up.

324
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,379
Yucheng, help me.

325
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,540
I don't understand it.

326
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,240
Okay.

327
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,820
Professor Yu, can you sign this for me?

328
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,410
Okay.

329
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,489
Isn't that your girlfriend? Did she come to accompany you to class?

330
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:48,140
Professor Yu, you have a great relationship.

331
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,519
She studies hard.

332
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,520
Thank you.

333
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,420
First, it's important to clarify the ultimate goal of monetary policy.

334
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,660
I will leave.

335
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,319
Yue.

336
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,260
Do you have a boyfriend?

337
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,140
Not yet.

338
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,440
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

339
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,180
Yucheng, we are not right for each other. And we don't know each other.

340
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,379
I know we haven't known each other for long.

341
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,459
But I like you.

342
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:43,680
And we have a lot of time to get to know each other.

343
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,040
If you want, we can hang out for a while.

344
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,319
Professor Yu.

345
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,820
Did I disturb you?

346
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,100
I was telling Shiyue about my feelings.

347
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,680
Shiyue,

348
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,419
I like you.

349
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,240
I hope you'll give me a chance.

350
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,939
I will take this relationship seriously.

351
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:31,100
And it won't affect our learning.

352
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,600
Yucheng, thank you for liking me.

353
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,219
But I can't accept your affections.

354
00:29:57,219 --> 00:30:00,259
We do have a lot of time to get to know each other.

355
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:02,659
But before that,

356
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:07,780
we need something like chemistry

357
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,559
a magical feeling that allows us to voluntarily begin the process of getting to know each other.

358
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,619
So,

359
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,920
you are saying that you don't want to get to know me?

360
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,400
Yes, that's right.

361
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,459
I see.

362
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,319
Professor Yu, excuse me.

363
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,480
Qin Shiyue.

364
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,080
Professor Yu, is there anything I can do for you?

365
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:01,619
- If not, I will leave. 
 - Yes.

366
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,580
I'll take you to a place.

367
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:45,759
Get on.

368
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,560
Hold tight. Don't worry.

369
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,719
I'm very skilled. Don't be scared.

370
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,940
Wow!

371
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,200
It's beautiful.

372
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,799
Qin Shiyue,

373
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,659
Iâ€¦

374
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,000
I have something to say to you.

375
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,800
We are not...

376
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,650
right for each other.

377
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,279
In terms of age, identity, and personality.

378
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,159
You are young, interesting, and cute.

379
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,119
I know what interests you about me.

380
00:33:54,119 --> 00:34:00,544
I know I can bring you some excitement, freshness, and uncertainty.

381
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,600
Do you know the real me?

382
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,519
For example, I am picky about food and donâ€™t like spicy food

383
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,519
and I like riding motorcycles, which is exciting and dangerous.

384
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,080
What's wrong with you?

385
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,380
You brought me to the top of a mountain with such beautiful scenery in the middle of the night, just to tell me this?

386
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,160
- Iâ€¦  
 - Don't you surf?

387
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,900
Haven't you read that

388
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,782
"If you can't accept me at my worst, you don't deserve the best of me."

389
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,979
I'm looking for a man I like.

390
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:34,119
I'm not looking for a perfect man for a secret organization.

391
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,160
What I am trying to say is, is that I like you.

392
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,639
I have a lot of problems.

393
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,200
What are your problems?

394
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,779
Iâ€¦

395
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:56,640
I'm older than you.

396
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,700
I may be boring. I can't bring you freshness all the time.

397
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,839
That's true.

398
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,820
Riding a motorbike is exciting. But you can't ride it all the time.

399
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,579
What ifâ€¦

400
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,613
What if I don't like it anymore?

401
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:16,650
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

402
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,300
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

403
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,719
So I wanted to tell you about my situation and my intentions.

404
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,900
I want you to make the decision.

405
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,275
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

406
00:35:29,275 --> 00:35:32,239
Z900. It's stylish, passionate, and free.

407
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,760
It belongs to the middle and high-end products of the Z series.

408
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,340
Its actual emissions are 948cc.

409
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,080
Its maximum horsepower is 117.3.

410
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,120
Z900's configurations are great.

411
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,120
It has an inline four-cylinder. It can reach up to 10,000 RPMs.

412
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,980
And at 7700 RPMs it can reach a peak torque of 95 meters.

413
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,820
What do you think? Am I right?

414
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,400
How do you know that?

415
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,840
Don't mistake me. I didn't memorize it.

416
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,760
I've always loved motorcycles. I used to ride them when I was abroad.

417
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,180
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

418
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,319
So, look.

419
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:14,260
There's a side to me that people don't know about.

420
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,820
Since we don't know each other well, we can work on it.

421
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,600
Everyone has different habits and hobbies.

422
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,000
We don't have to change them.

423
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,519
If you love a person, you have to love everything about him

424
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,880
and even be assimilated by him.

425
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,839
Love isâ€¦

426
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,760
Do you understand?

427
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,679
So, don't be reasonable.

428
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,699
I like you. That's my reason.

429
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:58,596
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

430
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:00,980
You're right.

431
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,020
Thenâ€¦.

432
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,680
Please take care of me, Ms. Qin.

433
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,860
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

434
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,680
Professor Yu is my boyfriend.

435
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:29,443
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

436
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:37,225
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

437
00:37:37,225 --> 00:37:40,700
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

438
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,720
Let's go back.

439
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,819
That's it?

440
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,780
Can you kiss me good night?

441
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:02,875
â™«  Maybe we were once all shining stars  â™«

442
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:08,139
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

443
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:11,070
Next time, you take the initiative.

444
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,119
My boyfriend, bye!

445
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,750
â™«  No matter how this fate started  â™«

446
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,800
You're busy. You don't have to buy a suitcase with me.

447
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,420
Black Horse is doing well. We will break through the technical difficulties.

448
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,500
So I have a lot of time to spend with you.

449
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:55,059
 Black Horse is doing well. 

450
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:59,460
 Could Shi Yan's situation be more difficult? 

451
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,339
Shall we go in there?

452
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,740
- What's wrong? 
  - What is the relationship between them? 

453
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,619
 Does my uncle know that? 

454
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,600
 What should my uncle do? 

455
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,559
Let's go and see.

456
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,940
This way, please.

457
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,880
How about this couple's seat?

458
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,920
We are just friends.

459
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,960
- Can we sit there? 
 - It's okay.

460
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,320
Please.

461
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,060
Here's the menu. Call me if you need anything else.

462
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,845
Thank you.

463
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,040
Sister Shuyi, what a coincidence.

464
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,960
 What's going on? 

465
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,260
Sister Shuyi, we haven't had dinner together in a while.

466
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,660
It hasn't bee that long.

467
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:15,440
I haven't had dinner with my uncle in a while.

468
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,199
Then why not sit down and eat together?

469
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,979
Excuse me.

470
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,860
That's all. Enjoy yourselves.

471
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,480
Thank you.

472
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,919
 Take the plate of fish as Sister Shuyi. 

473
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:55,419
The stock is savory. Have a try.

474
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,880
It is.

475
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,420
 Uncle, she ate the stock. 

476
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,040
Don't only play with your phone. Eat it while it's warm.

477
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,710
Thanks.

478
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,760
This is white asparagus.

479
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,740
It's great. It's their specialty.

480
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,760
Sister Shuyi,

481
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,519
this is your favorite.

482
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,860
My uncle likes asparagus,

483
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,619
especially the asparagus from your hometown, Qing'an.

484
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,360
Why didn't you tell me Qing'an's asparagus is delicious when I was there during the Spring Festival?

485
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,739
Because you ate them up.

486
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,459
 Uncle, do you still love her? 

487
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:17,360
 You will lose her. 

488
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,800
Thank you.

489
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,640
 Uncle, did you check your WeChat? 

490
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,260
 That guy is sweet and thoughtful. And he is more proactive than you. 

491
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,712
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

492
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:04,625
â™«  But your eyes are avoiding me  â™«

493
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,900
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

495
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,139
 Uncle, she ate the stock. 

496
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:16,359
 Uncle, do you still love her? 

497
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,220
 You will lose her. 

498
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,800
 Uncle, did you check your WeChat? 

499
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,740
 That guy is sweet and thoughtful. And he is more proactive than you.

â™«  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  â™«
