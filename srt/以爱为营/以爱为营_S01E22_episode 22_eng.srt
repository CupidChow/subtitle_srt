 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:32,230
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,555
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:37,705
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,230
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,655
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:48,255
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,441
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:53,880
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,055
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,230
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,655
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:06,380
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,415
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,975
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:16,430
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,080
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,605
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:35,855
   

21
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:39,041
   

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,760
You're here.

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,400
Mr. Yi.

24
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,539
I still want you to write an article for me.

25
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,500
Why do you insist on having me do this interview?

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,760
Because I like you very much.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,280
And your writing style.

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,260
Working with someone you like is the fastest way to get to know each other.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,439
With me being your interviewee you can get to know me better.

30
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,300
Then I can show you my merits and many other aspects of me.

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,919
You're quite straightforward.

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,060
Isn't it good to be direct?

33
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,900
That's what I think.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,400
You're very nice.

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,219
But we're not right for each other.

36
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,879
Not right for each other?

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,380
That means you don't dislike me.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,819
You simply came to an objective conclusion that we don't fit. Right?

39
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,580
Let me guess.

40
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,579
You rejected me because you already have a boyfriend.

41
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,060
Is that right?

42
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,940
Why do you say that?

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,240
Well, it might be a bit of a bold statement.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,779
Butâ€¦

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,379
When I said I liked you you rejected me outright without thinking.

46
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,980
It must be because you're already with someone.

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,859
That's why you won't notice any other guys.

48
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,400
Right?

49
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,235
It doesn't matter.

50
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,860
Most people's relationship choices are made instantaneously.

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,605
So it isn't necessarily a perfect choice.

52
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,211
Now you have a new choice.

53
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:22,159
You can take this interview.

54
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,119
Compare me and him.

55
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,520
Make a better choice.

56
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,580
Mr. Yi, I do have a boyfriend.

57
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,879
And my boyfriend is very good.

58
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,919
We won't break up.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,360
You're reluctant to compare us.

60
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,539
Is it because he's not as good as me?

61
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,980
True love cannot be compared.

62
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,759
And I'm not afraid of making the comparison.

63
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,280
An interview with you would be really newsworthy.

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,100
I'll seriously consider your offer.

65
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,919
Interesting.

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,539
I'll wait for your good news.

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
   

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
Mr. Yi.

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
Thank you for your trust.

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,960
Whoever does this interview

71
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,499
I can guarantee we'll write a high-quality article.

72
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:15,860
Thank you.

73
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,960
I have no doubt in Ms. Zheng's skills.

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,933
Goodbye, Ms. Tang.

75
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,580
Bye.

76
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,020
I thought Shuyi hadn't agreed yet?

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,619
You didn't take Yi Yang's interview, did you?

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,619
What's on your mind? What's there to worry about?

79
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,393
It's not like you to give up an opportunity like this?

80
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,159
I do have some concerns.

81
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,220
What concerns?

82
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,560
He's using it as an excuse to pursue me.

83
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,519
That's normal.

84
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,759
You're good-looking and attractive.

85
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,100
It's normal for him to be attracted to you.

86
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,679
From the looks of it, you're not interested in him. Right?

87
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:19,460
So it won't affect your work. Right?

88
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,199
I know that Yi Yang's interview is newsworthy.

89
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,620
That's why I didn't turn him down.

90
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,360
But I need some time to think about it.

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,240
But he used the interview to get closer to me.

92
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,940
I really can't accept it.

93
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,879
Sister Yi,

94
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,240
I won't let love affect my career.

95
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,759
But I won't sacrifice my love for my career.

96
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,995
In my heart, these two things are equally important.

97
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:41,260
I won't allow anything to influence either of them.

98
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,720
I understand.

99
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,739
Then take your time to consider.

100
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,519
Check it out.

101
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,600
After the live launch, Yi Yang's still being widely discussed online.

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
It's a hot topic.

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,539
It's a rare opportunity for your e-magazine upgrade.

104
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,860
I know what you mean.

105
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,460
I might need a little time to discuss this with someone very important.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,159
Okay. Then talk to him.

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,279
There's one more thing.

108
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,460
I'm going to the chip conference in Fucheng this weekend.

109
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,559
I'd like to apply for leave on Friday.

110
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,739
Chip conference?

111
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,720
How can you attend it?

112
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,220
We're not invited this year.

113
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,900
Shi Yan is taking me there.

114
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,560
Shiâ€¦

115
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,430
Shi Yan?

116
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
He's taking you there?

117
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,079
Yes, as what you heard.

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,599
Fine. Off you go.

119
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,480
Wait!

120
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,399
Why would Shi Yan take you there?

121
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,660
What's your relationship with him?

122
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,759
Are you twoâ€¦

123
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:23,100
Sister Yi, just ask if you're curious. But the gesture won't be necessary.

124
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,859
So, you two are?

125
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,539
Fine, you can go.

126
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,179
Remember to apply in the office system.

127
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:37,939
And remember to talk to him.

128
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:50,460
This little girl. She's like Old Guan said.

129
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,360
She's brave.

130
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,180
 Hey, Yi. What happened? 

131
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,900
Old Guan,

132
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,900
did I make a mistake?

133
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,360
What are you talking about?

134
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,476
 I mean... 

135
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:30,079
I have too many concerns in our relationship.

136
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,559
You have to keep it secret for me.

137
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,200
Does that make you unhappy?

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Why do you think so?

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,979
I'm happy with you.

140
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:46,480
Shuyi told me just now that she won't sacrifice love for work

141
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,220
or the other way around.

142
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,400
I suddenly felt... I felt bad for you.

143
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't have to feel bad for me.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,960
I have a lot of problems, too. Right?

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,340
You've been very tolerant of me.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,499
People in love should understand and accept each other.

147
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,179
Then, are you willing to give me some more time?

148
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,360
Let me plan it out.

149
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,580
Then we can stop hiding.

150
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,768
It doesn't matter if it's public or not.

151
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,460
The most important thing is that we truly love each other.

152
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:40,261
We can talk when you're ready to go public. Okay?

153
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,979
Okay. Thank you, Old Guan.

154
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,739
You've become more reserved.

155
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,340
I've always been a reserved and shy girl by nature.

156
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,859
Watch your step.

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,900
I've got you.

158
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm sure I'll watch my step when I'm on my own.

159
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,079
Isn't it boring going out with me?

160
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,480
No, it's not.

161
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm thinking about work.

162
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,720
So in your mind, your boyfriend is far less important than your job.

163
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,287
Thisâ€¦

164
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,459
Yi Yang from Dark Horse wants me to write an article for him.

165
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,904
He wants me to interview him.

166
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:04,019
And he even offers to put this interview in the e-magazine.

167
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,919
Isn't that great?

168
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,379
Your new year wish has come true.

169
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,399
He even confessed his love to me.

170
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,600
But I rejected him immediately on the spot.

171
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,159
I told him I already had a boyfriend.

172
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,251
And my boyfriend is handsome and brilliant, and we love each other very much.

173
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:22,290
Our love is eternal.

174
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,180
There's no way I'm leaving my boyfriend, and it is absolutely impossible to accept his pursuit.

175
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,420
Good.

176
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,679
And then?

177
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,046
Then he said he didn't care if I had a boyfriend or not.

178
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,740
He wanted me to get to know him through the interview

179
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,679
and compare him and you before making a new choice.

180
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,679
So I'm torn now.

181
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,279
I want to get this interview but I don't want to hurt our relationship.

182
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,919
So when we are dating, you are thinking about another man.

183
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,019
And you found out?

184
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,420
You know what?

185
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,340
Sometimes I wonder what kind of fairy Zheng Shuyi is?

186
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,600
Sometimes I wonder what kind of fairy Zheng Shuyi is?

187
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
She's smart. She's a big dreamer.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,340
She's got a strong sense of responsibility.

189
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,459
If she doesn't succeed, who will?

190
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,100
Shuyi, no matter what the decision you make is, I'll support you.

191
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,759
And how do you know after the interview you won't like me more?

192
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,200
And you'll be more certain about our love.

193
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,200
You're right.

194
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,019
Even with a hundred or a thousand Yi Yangs to be interviewed...

195
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,100
my favorite is still you.

196
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,419
Shuyi, you're so great.

197
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,540
So a lot of people will fall for you.

198
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,844
If I'm alerted every time someone falls for you and have to rely on you to avoid all men,

199
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:55,080
then that's a stupid method.

200
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,600
Wait.

201
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,259
That's the first time you've ever complimented me like that.

202
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:03,320
I'm going to record it.

203
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,859
You have a career.

204
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,060
And you love it.

205
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,779
When you're focused on your work, you are like a shinning star.

206
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,619
In our relationship, all the things I'm proud of are nothing in comparison.

207
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:25,140
I've been overwhelmed by your light.

208
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,860
But I know it was that light that drew my attention and led me to you.

209
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,039
I want your light to shine brighter and brighter, and my light, too.

210
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,205
I want my light to entangle with yours leaving no room for other people.

211
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:42,380
â™«  I never look back  â™«

212
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,563
â™«  Raindrops dance on eaves  â™«

213
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:50,734
â™«  The place where I suddenly look back  â™«

214
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:57,581
â™«  There you are, amidst dimming lights  â™«

215
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:05,519
â™«  I am destined to be with you  â™«

216
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,839
Shi Yan, I will love you with all my heart.

217
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,639
I will not let you down.

218
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,360
You've recorded it all.

219
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:21,359
â™«  May the drifting boat dock to its shore  â™«

220
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:26,400
Once I accept Yi Yang's interview request, I'll have to start preparing.

221
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,550
I'll have to give up our date on Friday.

222
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,200
â™«  May lovers eventually reach perfection  â™«

223
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,240
I can lend your work time to Yi Yang,

224
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,159
but your private time can only belong to me.

225
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,700
I got it.

226
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,779
Let me tell you something.

227
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,419
When you are in Fucheng, you must try the sea food dumplings.

228
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:52,996
And tell me if they're good.

229
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:55,639
Okay, I'll buy some for you.

230
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,940
Shanshan, this is not like you.

231
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,339
You were always the first to run away from this type of task.

232
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,459
 I'm going to Fucheng this weekend to attend the chip conference. 

233
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,819
 After that, I'm going back to Jiangcheng. 

234
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,720
 So this week, weâ€¦ 

235
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,039
The chip conference is where all the media are gathered.

236
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,099
Then our company must not let our competitors steal our spotlight.

237
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:21,500
I'm the right person for it.

238
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,639
Listen to what you just said.

239
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,579
Didn't I ever say the same to you before?

240
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,519
What was your reply back then?

241
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,959
Look at you now.

242
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,960
There must be something going on.

243
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,599
You're not going to see your boyfriend. Right?

244
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,840
What are you talking about, Mr. Shen?

245
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,100
You know me.

246
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,120
What kind of person is worth my trip?

247
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,040
I can't stay out of the field forever. Right?

248
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,640
Just let me go. I'll bring you some specialties when I get back.

249
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,620
Fine. If you want to go, just go.

250
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,079
In the future, I'll also send you on other similar jobs.

251
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,860
When I do, don't reject.

252
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,079
No problem. I won't reject.

253
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,679
Then off you go.

254
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,960
- I'm off. Bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

255
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,819
I know a very reliable decorator team.

256
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,180
If you need them, I can get in touch with them for you.

257
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,360
I can help install the door for you then you'll have no excuse.

258
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,300
Shiyue.

259
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,511
Who are you installing the door for?

260
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,499
Professor Yu.

261
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:34,759
You've only met twice. Yet you two know each other so well?

262
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,420
Wait.

263
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,180
After the exhibition that day, did you do something else?

264
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,460
After the exhibition, we went to see a movie.

265
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,420
A movie?

266
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,859
You and Yu Youâ€¦

267
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,900
You twoâ€¦?

268
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:03,340
I kind of like Professor Yu.

269
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,039
Did he bring you home later?

270
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,319
Did something happen?

271
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,004
Don't mention it.

272
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:14,359
- What happened? 
 - I was especially unlucky.

273
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,680
He sent me home after the movie.

274
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,720
I thought it was the right time.

275
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,599
So I asked him if we could go to his place.

276
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,860
And then?

277
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,419
Then he said, "There is no door."  (No way in) 

278
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,359
How unlucky.

279
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,179
So I'm helping him get the door fixed.

280
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,435
 And Shanshan called me a romance killer. 

281
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,839
 She's the real love killer. 

282
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,839
Shuyi,

283
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,939
did you get Yi Yang's interview?

284
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,500
Oh, speaking of which. I heard you took leave.

285
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,920
Are you attending an event?

286
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,259
 I'd better not mention the chip conference. 

287
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,020
 Shi Yan wanted to take me there. I should keep it a secret. 

288
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,580
I have a plan with a friend.

289
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,499
 A boyfriend is also a friend. 

290
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,880
I thought you managed to get an invite to the chip conference.

291
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,799
We're definitely not as well-connected as you.

292
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,300
So next time, if you have any good opportunities, bring us along.

293
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,939
No problem.

294
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,759
Shuyi,

295
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,100
when is the chip conference?

296
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,680
This weekend.

297
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,780
Do you think Professor Yu will be there?

298
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,080
He's the Guans' strategy consultant. So he was invited.

299
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,340
It's a critical time for Le'an Tech.

300
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,079
I guess he'll be there.

301
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,720
 Guan Ji, 

302
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,468
 are you going to the chip conference in Fucheng? 

303
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:16,079
 Take me along. 

304
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,039
 Please. 

305
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,720
 Hello, Shanshan. 

306
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,140
My company sent me to cover the chip conference.

307
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,400
If it's not too much troublecould you give me a ride?

308
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,699
 I'm sorry, Shanshan. 

309
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,402
No worries. I'll take someone else's car.

310
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:43,240
That's all for now. I'm hanging up now.

311
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:00,705
Thank you, Mr. Yi, for inviting me.

312
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:03,519
I'm honored to have the opportunity to do this interview.

313
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,740
I should thank you for accepting the invitation.

314
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,599
Just call me Yi Yang.

315
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,400
By the way... you look great today.

316
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,799
Thank you, Mr. Yi.

317
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,500
For the rest of the program, I'll call you Mr. Yi.

318
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,480
That's fine. Then I'll keep calling you Ms. Zheng during the interview.

319
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,640
After the interview, can I call you Shuyi?

320
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,640
In exchange, you can call me by my first name too.

321
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,020
You're really a persistent businessman.

322
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,560
Even for how we call each other, you're considering exchanges.

323
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,260
Are you very used to talking business to people?

324
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,699
Let's get started.

325
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,960
I'll start with a question that everyone is curious about.

326
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,636
You had a good career abroad.

327
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:02,200
Why did you suddenly choose to return home?

328
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,319
Becauseâ€¦

329
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,392
I can't stand foreign food.

330
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,630
Even if the ingredients and seasonings are good,

331
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,270
I'm not used to the flavor.

332
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,759
With a good chef, Chinese food can become popular worldwide.

333
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,519
I'd like to come back and try being a good cook.

334
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,540
That answer is typically you.

335
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,534
You named the company Black Horse.

336
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:34,060
What's the significance of that?

337
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,090
I chose the name because I feel

338
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,110
I can lead the company to achieve unprecedented results.

339
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,200
You seem very confident in it.

340
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,759
Of course.

341
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,859
With Bruce's help, we're even stronger.

342
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,980
Then, how did you manage to steal Bruce?

343
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,839
"Steal" is not the right word.

344
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,300
As a matter of fact, Bruce and I hit it off right away.

345
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,820
When we were studying abroad, we both admired each other's talent.

346
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,939
We've kept in touch ever since.

347
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:12,679
This time, we chose to become partners and fight together.

348
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,480
I think there should be no team in China that can rival us for the time being.

349
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,119
I think I understand why Bruce was attracted to you.

350
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,440
Your confidence is very attractive.

351
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,540
It makes you appear very trustworthy.

352
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,319
Confidence is only possible with real strength.

353
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,580
Confidence is the key to unlimited possibilities.

354
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,480
Recently, people are also saying that

355
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,820
Black Horse has been targeting Le'an and Cloud Innovation since returning home.

356
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,899
Do you really have such a plan?

357
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:45,020
What do you think?

358
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,319
You want to know my opinion?

359
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,340
Listening to different people can give me a clearer picture.

360
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,160
It's possible that you're targeting Le'an Tech.

361
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,519
As for Cloud Innovation.

362
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,650
An investment company and a tech company

363
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,400
can hardly have any competition.

364
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,367
That's all there is to it.

365
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,540
So let's move on to Black Horse's real vision for the future.

366
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,780
Guan Ji!

367
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,620
What's wrong with you?

368
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,160
What did you do to have gotten yourself into such a sorry state?

369
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,680
It wasn't me.

370
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,120
It's you who did.

371
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,179
He's hurt in love.

372
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,100
 Are you ready? 

373
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,000
I'll pack myself up right away and send myself to you.

374
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,640
 Come downstairs. Fan is here to pick you up. 

375
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,619
 I'll wait for you in Fucheng. 

376
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,459
Shuyi.

377
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,519
Shuyi.

378
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,039
What are you doing?

379
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,219
I've waited for you here.

380
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:53,640
I'd like to talk to you.

381
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,618
But I don't want to talk to you.

382
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:58,000
Let go of me. I've got things to do.

383
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,780
Just give me a few minutes, Shuyi.

384
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,463
Okay, two minutes.

385
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,459
Say what do you have to say.

386
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,039
Shuyi.

387
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,880
Do you have a new boyfriend?

388
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,579
None of your business.

389
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,640
You can have a new boyfriend.

390
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,400
I know I'm in no position to interfere.

391
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,719
But... are you with a married man?

392
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,620
What's wrong with you?

393
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,507
You think I'm as shameless as your girlfriend?

394
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:36,379
I'm sorry. I'll have to disappoint you.

395
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:38,720
I know I'm in no position to say this.

396
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,219
But Lezhi won't say this for no reason.

397
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:44,440
I hope you'll stop doing the wrong thing.

398
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,079
Yue Xingzhou, do you think you're too kind?

399
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,839
You and Qin Lezhi are funny.

400
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,480
You cheated on me.

401
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,646
Yet now you act like a saint and want to educate me.

402
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:58,060
Do you have no shame?

403
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,200
Before giving me advice, check your own behavior first.

404
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,319
Get out of my way.

405
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,428
I don't have time for this.

406
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,619
He's waiting for me.

407
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:21,259
- Isn't heâ€¦ 
 - Yeah, that's my boyfriend.

408
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,220
Don't tell me you want to give me another lecture.

409
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,252
- You two, why? 
 - What's wrong?

410
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,480
We love each other and we're right for each other.

411
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,039
Do we need your approval?

412
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,319
Shuyi! Are you trying to get back at me?

413
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:44,920
Yue Xingzhou, you think too highly of yourself.

414
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,459
From now on, we'll be relatives.

415
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:48,519
You'd better show some respect to your aunt-in-law.

416
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,100
Don't touch me with no reason.

417
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,020
Thank you.

418
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,519
Ms. Zheng, Mr. Shi will be there at noon.

419
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:16,739
He especially asked me to take you there.

420
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:18,999
Got it, thank you.

421
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,039
Are you on the way?

422
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,039
 Already on the way. 

423
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,380
Good. It's a couple of hours' drive.

424
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,119
Get some rest. I'll see you tonight.

425
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,640
What's wrong? You're not happy?

426
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,359
 I'm fine. 

427
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,000
Mr. Shi, why are you standing here? Why don't you go in?

428
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,519
Why don't you go back to work?

429
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm going to take a nap.

430
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,400
I'll message you when I get there.

431
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,119
Okay. See you tonight.

432
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,079
 Shuyi, are you trying to get back at me?  

433
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,299
 Whoever knows about this will think I'm using Shi Yan to get back at Yue Xingzhou. 

434
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:13,799
 If Shi Yan knows about this, he'll think the same thing 

435
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,960
 Professor Yu, 

436
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,640
 have you left for Fucheng? 

437
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,300
 How did you know about my trip? 

438
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,589
 Sister Shuyi told me this chip conference is very important. 

439
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:53,740
 You'll definitely be there. 

440
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,640
 I'm ready to go. 

441
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,519
 Safe travels. 

442
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,966
Who are you texting? You seem very happy.

443
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:10,440
It took you less than 10 minutes to recover from your hurt feelings.

444
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,599
Why are you so nosy?

445
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,880
I'm nosy?

446
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,219
That's because I care about you.

447
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:18,720
Men nowadays are all smart.

448
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,240
I'm afraid you'll be bullied.

449
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,319
If you have any questions, you should consult me more often.

450
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,559
I definitely know more about men than you do.

451
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,300
Believe me.

452
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,620
As long as you tell me, I can use my rich experience to help you.

453
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,440
Then you'll know how helpful I can be.

454
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,039
I have a friend.

455
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,820
He likes A.

456
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,000
And A told my friend he likes B's type.

457
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,640
But B is probably not interested in A.

458
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,680
But in the short term my friend can't become like B.

459
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,079
If you were me, what would you do?

460
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,519
Little girl.

461
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,519
You suddenly threw me a very complicated love triangle problem?

462
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,780
Are you sure you're experienced?

463
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,540
The guy you like doesn't sound like a good person.

464
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,140
It's not me, it's my friend.

465
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,480
Fine.

466
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,100
Your friend already told A that she likes him.

467
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,308
Yet A told your friend that he likes B.

468
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:27,425
That's gaslighting.

469
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,450
Even if you the two are together,

470
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,730
this man still has someone else in his heart.

471
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,519
Listen to me. Forget about this man.

472
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,920
You know nothing.

473
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,799
I told you she's my friend. It's not me.

474
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,179
Fine. Your friend.

475
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
Mr. Shi.

476
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,472
I've heard a lot about you.

477
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,796
Ms. Zheng, you're so young.

478
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,599
Yet your articles are so good.

479
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,980
You're so young and talented.

480
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,039
I'm flattered, Mr. Fan.

481
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,061
Mr. Fan, can you play my song list?

482
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:37,040
No problem. Just connect your Bluetooth.

483
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,887
   

484
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:45,960
â™«  Amidst countless wonders  â™«

485
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,200
What a coincidence! Mr. Shi likes to listen to Song Lelan's songs, too.

486
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,620
â™«  I never look back  â™«

487
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,799
 Shi Yan likes Song Lelan, too. What a coincidence! 

488
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,801
   

489
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,922
 He didn't take advantage of me. 

490
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:31,079
 He booked a room for me. 

491
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,219
 That's Shi Yan for you. 

492
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:39,249
 I'm at the hotel. Where are you? 

493
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,319
Come on, let's have a drink.

494
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:42,440
Come on.

495
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,292
Come on, let's drink.

496
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:45,892
   

497
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,121
Mr. Shi, Ms. Zheng is here.

498
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,280
She's already checked in.

499
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,379
Speaking of which, Mr. Shi and Mr. Yi are connected in some way.

500
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,400
Connected?

501
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:10,480
Mr. Yi's partner is the technical adviser Mr. Shi specially invited to Le'an Tech.

502
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,079
Now you two can sit at the same table having a good time.

503
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:21,359
I appreciate your big hearts.

504
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,839
- Come on, let's drink. 
 - Come on.

505
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,939
Why doesn't he reply to me?

506
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,580
 You were the one who invited me. 

507
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,820
 But now you'releaving me alone in the hotel. 

508
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,260
 I haven't had dinner yet. 

509
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,279
Old Huang,

510
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,759
I'm really not sure if you mean it to be a compliment.

511
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,400
Mr. Shi and Mr. Yi are both very kind and generous.

512
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,979
They won't have frictions because of a technical adviser.

513
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,320
Mr. Huang may have meant it in a kind way.

514
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,139
But he got it wrong.

515
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,480
Mr. Yi and I don't have any frictions.

516
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,719
Black Horse and Le'an Tech are just competing in a healthy way.

517
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm happy to see that.

518
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,919
As for Bruce, he has his own ideas and I respect his choice.

519
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,199
Mr. Shi and I both appreciate Bruce so much.

520
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,599
That means we see eye to eye.

521
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,740
Black Horse and Le'an Tech are in competition.

522
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,540
Butâ€¦ competition is the only way to improve.

523
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,700
As for Black Horse and Cloud Innovation,

524
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,000
maybe we can work together in the future.

525
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,139
Right, Mr. Shi?

526
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,760
Mr. Shi and Mr. Yi really have a big vision.

527
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,880
Since fate brought us here, let's have a drink.

528
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 - Cheers. 
 - Cheers. 

529
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,679
I've seen Financial Introduce's interview with you.

530
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,280
Really?

531
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,300
That article was really well written.

532
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,539
With all due respect.

533
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,039
You're very good.

534
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,820
But Le'an Tech doesn't have a good enough leader.

535
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,440
Chen Kang's a bit indecisive.

536
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,119
He cares too much about other people's feelings.

537
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,519
He's likely to miss the key point and make some decisions that lack foresight.

538
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,040
That's why it's hard for him to retain talent.

539
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,039
So?

540
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,300
Soâ€¦

541
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,400
Regarding the technological breakthrough and the domestic market of millimeter wave chips,

542
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,600
Dark Horse is bound to win.

543
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,860
A toast to Black Horse.

544
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,520
Thank you.

545
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,639
 Some people are eating a lot of food. 

546
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:04,259
 Some are starving. 

547
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,980
 I'll be fine. I'm all good. 

548
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:40,199
 I'm busy. 

549
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,419
It's been a while.

550
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,998
Sorry, guys. Something's come up. Excuse me for a moment.

551
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,840
Mr. Shi.

552
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,159
Let's go.

553
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,960
Don't drink too much.

554
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,440
You're leaving now?

555
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,159
Something came up. I'll be back later.

556
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,079
What happened?

557
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
I have to feed a cat.

558
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,320
What?

559
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,960
You're traveling with a cat?

560
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,679
It's so clingy.

561
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,159
It's a bit aggressive.

562
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,040
It'll scratch you if it starves.

563
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,199
Mr. Fan, Mr. Shi drank a lot today.

564
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,619
Drive slowly.

565
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,500
Yes.

566
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,420
No need. Just drive at normal speed.

567
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,080
Okay, Mr. Shi.

568
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,239
What are you doing?

569
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,159
 I'm having a good time. 

570
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,440
What did you say?

571
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,920
I said I'm having a good time.

572
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,719
Put more chili on it for me.

573
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,119
Okay, any green onion?

574
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,199
No, no, no green onions.

575
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,755
- You've got a crush, right? 
 - Let's talk to her.

576
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,480
Pretty girl, are you alone?

577
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,500
Anything the matter?

578
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,440
Let's go together. It's cold today.

579
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,280
Let's have a drink and warm up.

580
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,000
- Let's go. 
 - Let go of me!

581
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,180
Pretty girl, you're out alone?

582
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,880
Don't be shy. Let's have dinner together.

583
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,719
Yeah, let's make friends.

584
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,400
It's still early.

585
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,719
Let's go sing Karaoke afterward.

586
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,280
Miss, your skewers are ready. Hurry up and go home.

587
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,099
Miss, your skewers are ready. Hurry up and go home.

588
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,360
- They won't be good if they get cold. 
 - Thank you.

589
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,002
Don't go. We said we'd like to be friends.

590
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:18,199
Let's sit together.

591
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,760
Let go! Let go!

592
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,359
Who are you?

593
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,239
Do you want to fight?

594
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,440
What are you doing?

595
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,939
- Why did you go out alone at night? 
 - I went out to buy food.

596
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:08,239
You asked me to come to Fucheng. And then you left me alone.

597
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,239
I sent you messages and waited for a long time. Then all I got was "I am busy."

598
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,519
Then you showed up out of the blue and dragged me away without saying a word.

599
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,480
Can't this be a reason for me to go out?

600
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:38,700
Do you have to dress so prettily when you go out for food?

601
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,580
Can't I? Do I even need your approval on that?

602
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:44,759
You don't know how easily you can become a target?

603
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,000
Am I your target?

604
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,563
Think carefully before you answer.

607
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,119

615
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,754

Zheng Shuyi,

625
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,700
you don't know where your room is?

626
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,400
What's wrong with you?

627
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,780
I'm thinking about something.

628
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,220
I'm thinkingâ€¦

629
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,360
did you just kiss me in the elevator?

630
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,519
Can you do it again?

631
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,000
I didn't feel it. Can you do it again?

632
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,492
There's always a chance to make up a test.

633
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:39,360
I'm applying for a make-up test.

634
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,480
Go back to bed.

635
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,440
Are you sure you don't want to do it again?

636
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,540
I didn't feel anything.

â™«  Meeting you, approaching you  â™«

644
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:59,652
â™«  Falling in love with you, losing you  â™«

645
00:43:59,652 --> 00:44:01,779
â™«  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  â™«

646
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:07,416
â™«  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  â™«

647
00:44:08,577 --> 00:44:13,471
â™«  Let the tears struggle and fall  â™«

648
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:20,361
â™«  Are you just a passerby from now on?  â™«

649

652
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:40,541
â™«  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  â™«

653
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:44,655
â™«  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  â™«

654
00:44:44,655 --> 00:44:49,991
â™«  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  â™«

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,156
â™«  Don't go far, okay?  â™«
