 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,300
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,525
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,900
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,888
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,225
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,599
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,225
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,525
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,475
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,300
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,911
   

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,007
Are you off work?

23
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,560
I am hungry.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,460
Too hungry to go home.

25
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,019
I can only hold on for another 20 minutes.

26
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:19,459
Then, I will be there in 20 minutes.

27
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:31,100
 Shi Yan, when I tell you about it, 

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,500
 please trust me. 

29
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,639
Hello, sir.

30
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,387
Are you here to invite Ms. Zheng Shuyi to dinner?

31
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,599
 Didn't he just arrive? 

32
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,880
 It's cold. 

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,420
 But the hood is cold. 

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,619
What's wrong?

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Nothing.

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,980
I am hungry. I can't open the door myself.

37
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,859
I brought it on my way here. Have some.

38
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,619
 He's been waiting for me downstairs. 

39
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,459
 And he bought me a cup of milk tea. 

40
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,760
 Shi Yan, you are so nice to me. 

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,599
 I can't live without you. 

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Yi, if you miss this vintage wine,

43
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,039
you will regret it.

44
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,940
I don't think you want to leave yourself with regret at the end of the year.

45
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,739
I'm afraid I will drink too much and miss work tomorrow.

46
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:37,560
It's the last workday of the year.

47
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,125
This year's issue shall be solved this year.

48
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,959
Then you will get a good start for the next year.

49
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,959
Can this year's issue be solved this year?

50
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,720
Guan.

51
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,560
You lost the bet with me. Right?

52
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,663
You owe me this.

53
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,200
Come on.

54
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,060
Why are you acting like a child?

55
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,079
This year's issues are well-solved.

56
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,519
Let's solve new issues in the coming year.

57
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,379
I wish you all the best in the coming year.

58
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,920
I wish you all the best in the coming year.

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,620
And all issues can be easily solved.

60
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,820
All the best.

61
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,460
Taste it.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,700
   

63
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,419
 It's a lot of money. 

64
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,360
 I can buy my parents something great. 

65
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:55,599
Holidays are coming.

66
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,260
Shuyi and Yue, how about we go celebrate tonight?

67
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,099
My treat.

68
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,900
How about after the holidays?

69
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
I am going back to Qing'an tomorrow morning.

70
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,240
I want to buy gifts for my parents.

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,059
What about you?

72
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:12,739
I have plans.

73
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,240
All right.

74
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,920
I love the holidays, but it's too long.

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,120
Ms. Nan, what are you talking about?

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,820
Are you possessed by Ms. Shuyi?

77
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,439
Why do you think the holidays are too long?

78
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,900
Shuyi, are you also taking the high-speed train back?

79
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,800
What time is your train? How about we go there together?

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,419
No, my train is very early.

81
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,019
My friend will take me there.

82
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,160
Never mind.

83
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,759
Since you don't want to celebrate it,

84
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,240
I'll leave first.

85
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,279
Sister Nan, I will leave with you.

86
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,300
- Let's go. 
 - Bye-bye.

87
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
Bye-bye.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,660
Sister Shuyi, Happy Spring Festival.

89
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,580
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

90
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,780
 My house is close to the high-speed train station. 

91
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,080
 It only takes half an hour. 

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,399
 You don't have to send me there tomorrow. 

93
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,520
 I live close to your house. 

94
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,519
 It only takes half an hour. 

95
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,900
Miss, can I help you?

96
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,660
Are you buying it for yourself or someone else?

97
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,540
For someone else.

98
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,699
Is it for a man or a woman?

99
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,860
And how old is that person?

100
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,040
For a man in his fifties.

101
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,780
Okay.

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,020
This men's watch is classic. It's simple and elegant.

103
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,680
It's perfect for a man in his fifties.

104
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,960
That's it.

105
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,500
Okay, I will wrap it up for you.

106
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,120
Thank you.

107
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,140
The dial of this watch is made of sapphire.

108
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,634
Your skin is white. And your wrist is thin.

109
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,360
With this watch, your wrist will look thin and beautiful.

110
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,679
Let's look at the watches.

111
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,580
I don't want to buy it. I don't like to wear watches

112
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,799
I want to buy one for Xingzhou.

113
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,240
He likes this brand.

114
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,799
 I met Qin Lezhi again. 

115
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,859
 I won't come to this mall again. 

116
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,100
This watch is perfect for you.

117
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,259
It's a little expensive.

118
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,119
But it is worth it.

119
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,499
All right, I will buy them both.

120
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:41,099
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

121
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:42,719
You bought two watches at once,

122
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,332
we will offer you a premium membership.

123
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,879
You can earn reward points.

124
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,500
She became different after she got a sugar daddy.

125
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,699
She doesn't care about spending money.

126
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,879
Why is everyone rich and I am poor?

127
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,519
Why is everyone rich and I am poor?

128
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,319
You could be rich if you got a rich boyfriend.

129
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,740
But he might be old and he might have a wife and children.

130
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,480
But he might be old and he might have a wife and children.

131
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Can you accept that?

132
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,760
Forget it. I know who I am.

133
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,700
Rich men don't like me.

134
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,320
 When will you leave tomorrow? 

135
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,100
 The high-speed train departs at seven. 

136
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,119
 I will send you there. 

137
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,919
 Okay, I will wait for you. 

138
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,499
- Here's your membership card. 
 - Thanks.

139
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,759
Here you are.

140
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,820
- See you. 
 - See you.

141
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,059
My boyfriend is rich. So what?

142
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,140
He's not only rich.

143
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,680
You'll be respectful to my boyfriend.

144
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,420
Am I right?

145
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,293
Youâ€¦

146
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,159
Hello.

147
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,600
 Lezhi, I am on the way to pick you up. 

148
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,259
Yu You.

149
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,820
Qin Shiyue, what are you doing here?

150
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

151
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,779
You must be going back home.

152
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,939
Are you here just to say goodbye to me?

153
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,320
Kitty.

154
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,127
You're so cute.

155
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:33,960
What's your name?

156
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
Frost.

157
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
It's from "dew and frost gleam."

158
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,240
You have a name.

159
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,620
That's a pretty name.

160
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,300
- Frost, let me hold you. 
 - Don't.

161
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,399
Let me have a look.

162
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,220
It must have hurt.

163
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,139
It's fine.

164
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,640
None of these wildcats at school have been vaccinated against rabies.

165
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,540
I'll take you to the hospital.

166
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,399
 It was worth it. 

167
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,759
Your ex-girlfriend is great.

168
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,400
What happened?

169
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,059
Nothing.

170
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,699
She got a rich boyfriend.

171
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,579
She spends money freely.

172
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:42,559
You made a mistake.

173
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,340
She has nothing to do with the CFO of your company.

174
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,460
Do you trust her that much?

175
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,999
Or did you contact her behind my back?

176
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,660
I didn't. I just guessed.

177
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,139
I've warned her.

178
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,300
If Mr. Qiu's wife finds it out,

179
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,640
she will be eaten alive.

180
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,720
If you don't like her, just tell your uncle about it.

181
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,119
I don't want to bother him with that.

182
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,239
Let's eat. The food is getting cold.

183
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,879
   

184
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,380
Be sure to get your last few shots on time.

185
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,360
- Thanks, Doctor. 
 - No worries, you may leave.

186
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,879
Thank you.

187
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,579
Yu You, thank you for coming to the hospital with me today.

188
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,280
About the last few shots,

189
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,639
do you have time to come with me?

190
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:50,339
I am sorry.

191
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm going back to Qing'an for the Spring Festival.

192
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,420
It's all right.

193
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,799
Then, could you text me on WeChat

194
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,720
to remind me to get my shot?

195
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,899
Okay.

196
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:11,300
I will remind you.

197
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,899
Great.

198
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,899
He came so early.

199
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,200
When did he get up?

200
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,579
Let me.

201
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,400
I'm taking many things. It may be heavy.

202
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,460
It's fine.

203
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,420
It's cold. Get in the car first.

204
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,919
Be good.

205
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,160
Are you upset?

206
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,960
I feel sad when I think

207
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,860
I won't be able to see you for a few days.

208
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,699
Are you going to visit all your relatives?

209
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,720
Not all of them. We don't have many relatives.

210
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,180
I only need to visit them from the first day to the third day.

211
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,639
I see.

212
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,360
Take care of yourself.

213
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,300
 Stop me. 

214
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,460
 Tell me that you bought a ticket to Qing'an. 

215
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,700
 Tell me that you will come to visit me. 

216
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,220
 He has to be with his family. 

217
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,819
 I forgive him. 

218
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,180
Yi,

219
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,040
why are you buying me such an expensive thing? I have a watch.

220
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,120
You get what you pay for.

221
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,560
This watch is waterproof and durable, and it doesn't use batteries.

222
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,900
You can wear it to work and go fishing.

223
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,659
Yi has a good taste.

224
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:22,560
Look. The earrings look great with the scarf.

225
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,981
My sisters will bother me.

226
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:25,860
Why?

227
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,639
They will be like, "Where did you get it?"

228
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,039
Look at your mom. She's proud.

229
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,239
Aren't you proud?

230
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:38,280
Someone buys every issue of Financial Introduce

231
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,420
and puts them on his desk.

232
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,000
Someone wants to show off that the article was written by his daughter.

233
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,120
I want to show off.

234
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,679
Are those ordinary articles?

235
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,440
They are front-page articles.

236
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,759
Front-page.

237
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,020
Well.

238
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,400
What time is it?

239
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,460
Greet people like this tomorrow.

240
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,020
 Did you get home? 

241
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,499
 Yes. 

242
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:18,659
 As soon as I got home, I remembered something. 

243
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:20,419
 What's that? 

244
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,099
 You. 

245
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:34,519
   

246
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,560
Shi Yan.

247
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,200
You are so good at it now.

248
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,079
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed can not be connected for the moment. 

249
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,119
 Please try again later. 

250
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,520
 Sorry. 

251
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,680
Hello.

252
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:19,200
It's you.

253
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,039
Where is Ms. Bi?

254
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,900
She asked for leave and went home for the Spring Festival.

255
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,459
Thanks.

256
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,291
   
   

257
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,059
Hello, Liang.

258
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,839
I need you to do something for me.

259
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,600
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

260
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,725
â™«  But your eyes are avoiding me  â™«

261
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:12,050
â™«  A sincere heart is defined because of you  â™«

262
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,450
   

263
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,275
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

264
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:20,300
â™«  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  â™«

265
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:32,250
â™«  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  â™«

266
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,372
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

267
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,149
   

268
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:39,775
â™«  But I'm afraid it's too late  â™«

269
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:44,975
â™«  I predicted the rain, but I pretend not to care  â™«

270
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,975
â€‹â™«  Lost in the night  â™«

271
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:51,956
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

272
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:56,833
â™«  The courage to transcend time  â™«

273
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,200
â™«  Even if I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

274
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:08,628
â™«  I'll let you know that I'm still where I am  â™«

275
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:24,425
â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

276
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:27,159
â™«  But I'm afraid it's too late  â™«

277
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,000
Come on.

278
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,039
I've been waiting for youâ€¦

279
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:35,880
â€‹â™«  Lost in the night  â™«

280
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,920
I tell you. We can't skimp on wedding planning.

281
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,000
I must check it myself.

282
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,740
Okay, it's up to you.

283
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,580
We don't have much time, but I'll do my best.

284
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,340
Okay.

285
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,325
â™«  Even I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

286
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:58,230
â™«  I'll let you know that I'm still where I am  â™«

287
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,399
I need to answer this.

288
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,620
Hello, babe.

289
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,060
 Shanshan, I miss you every holiday. 

290
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,100
 Do you miss me? 

291
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,640
What are you doing? Shopping?

292
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,360
 I am preparing for my cousin's wedding. 

293
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,500
God.

294
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,940
Isn't he two years younger than you? He's getting married?

295
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,640
 Look at him. You fell behind. 

296
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,599
You're no better than me.

297
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,180
We are different.

298
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,100
I have a boyfriend.

299
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,060
What?

300
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,459
Do I need to prepare red envelopes for you?

301
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:44,740
 I can plan your wedding and host the wedding for you. 

302
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,420
I'm not pushing for it.

303
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,720
I am loyal.

304
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,259
I will get married after you get a boyfriend.

305
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,280
 Don't worry. 

306
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,160
 After the holidays, I'll find you a date. 

307
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,059
 I'll use my experience to help you stay away from scum. 

308
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,240
 Thank you. 

309
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,500
My pleasure.

310
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,880
I have to go. My parents are back.

311
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,719
Yu You, keep your word.

312
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,340
You said you would remind me.

313
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,300
Don't forget it.

314
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:31,946
   

315
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,499
   

316
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,300
He remembered.

317
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,659
 I am scared. I don't want to go. 

318
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,350
 I am scared. I don't want to go.] 

319
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,380
 Are you worried about me? 

320
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,079
 I don't want to get shots alone. 

321
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,599
 Unless you will come with me. 

322
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,580
Am I going too far?

323
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,640
Why doesn't he answer me?

324
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,659
 Okay, get today's shot first. 

325
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,240
 Yes, sir. 

326
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,510
Shanshan.

327
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,300
Guan Ji.

328
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,559
What are you doing here?

329
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,100
How do you know I live here?

330
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,820
You didn't answer my phone.

331
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,160
You didn't reply to my messages.

332
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,379
So here I am.

333
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,519
I am a little busy.

334
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,139
What are you busy with?

335
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,720
Didn't you promise me that you wouldn't avoid me?

336
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,620
Didn't you promise me that you wouldn't avoid me?

337
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,780
Even the game has a break.

338
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,559
I want to spend the Spring Festival in peace.

339
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,520
It's lateâ€¦ Go back to the hotel and rest.

340
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,839
Tomorrow is Spring Festival's Eve.

341
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,840
Go home early.

342
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,479
Bi Ruoshan, I like you.

343
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,699
Don't you know that?

344
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,660
We meet every week and spend some time together.

345
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,420
We are exclusive to each other.

346
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,580
But we don't bother each other.

347
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,680
In this way, I like you too.

348
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,160
That's not what I'm trying to say.

349
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,139
- It'sâ€¦ 
 - What do you want to say?

350
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:28,620
If you play with a toy for a long time, you will develop feelings for it.

351
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,200
Not to mention it's a toy with an unsolved mystery.

352
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,039
I didn't reply to you for a short time, you couldn't take it.

353
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,000
After all, your feelings for me

354
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,560
are due to your desire to conquer and your possessiveness.

355
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,200
You can't accept people and feelings that you can't control.

356
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,660
So, you came here and said you liked me.

357
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,500
What next?

358
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,440
No.

359
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,480
We...

360
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,559
are not going to work out.

361
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,060
Please let me go.

362
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,179
Let's stop here.

363
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:17,979
From now on, let's leave each other alone.

364
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:59,275
   

365
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,820
You've been playing with your phone since you got home.

366
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,039
Why don't you marry it?

367
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,459
I'm sending Spring Festival's greetings to my leader.

368
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:24,279
You are thoughtful.

369
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,360
Did you send greetings to Yu You?

370
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,900
I did.

371
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,779
I wish him a Happy Spring Festival, abundant wealth, every success in his work, and good health.

372
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:33,299
Am I being sincere?

373
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,019
I came up with these blessings on my own.

374
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,320
You might as well ask him for dinner and bless him in person.

375
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,920
That's more sincere.

376
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,540
Where are you going? Dinner's ready.

377
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,419
I know.

378
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,020
- Hello. 
  - What are you doing? 

379
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,480
Did you have the Spring Festival's Eve dinner?

380
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,759
 Not yet. Did you? 

381
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,640
I didn't either.

382
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:05,319
Are there stars in Jiangcheng today?

383
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:10,319
I wanted to say that Iâ€¦

384
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,599
Yes, there are many stars.

385
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,720
I miss you, Zheng Shuyi.

386
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:20,240
I miss you, too. I want to see you.

387
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,415
You will see me soon.

388
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:26,120
I don't think so. It's a long time.

389
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,580
 Yi, time for dinner. 

390
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,000
Coming.

391
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,739
My mom called me to dinner.

392
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,079
Okay, eat more.

393
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,880
 Same to you. 

394
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,020
Give me a hand.

395
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
You haven't eaten yet.

396
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,580
But you look like you're full.

397
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,840
Yu You is busy.

398
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,800
He just got home today.

399
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,860
Young people are working hard.

400
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,279
Let him rest for a few days.

401
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,680
We will take Yi to have dinner with him.

402
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,929
I don't want to go.

403
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:09,799
Why?

404
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,940
I don't want to go.

405
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,700
Don't fix us up. We don't have a vibe.

406
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,219
Andâ€¦

407
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,160
I have plans for my relationship.

408
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,599
You say that every time.

409
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,140
But nothing has happened.

410
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,219
You'll be freaked out when it happens.

411
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:31,800
It's the Spring Festival, don't say anything unlucky.

412
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,519
Don't take it seriously.

413
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:38,100
My mom's cooking is amazing.

414
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,739
Your dad made them.

415
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,879
You sucked up to the wrong person.

416
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,620
Shut upâ€¦

417
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,300
All right. Here.

418
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,560
Happy Spring Festival.

419
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:51,500
Happy Spring Festival.

420
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,740
- Happy Spring Festival. 
 - Dad, Happy Spring Festival.

421
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,019
Dad, wish you good health.

422
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,479
Cheers.

423
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,620
- Let's eat. 
 - I haven't eaten my brother-in-law's Michelin food in a long time.

424
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,219
Can he reach the level of Michelin? Just taste it.

425
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,920
Taste it and you'll know.

426
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,999
It's really rare.

427
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:15,460
Mr. Shi, it's really rare for the Shi's to get together.

428
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,120
I can only be idle if they are busy.

429
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,380
Xiaoming, I didn't see you on New Year's Day.

430
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,860
Will you get some days off for the Spring Festival?

431
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,780
You can go to my stable to ride a horse with Shi Yan and Guan Ji.

432
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,080
And... you can go to my wine cellar and try my new wine.

433
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,340
It's better than this.

434
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,000
He's bragging.

435
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,400
I want to. But I have to go abroad for a project in two days.

436
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,540
Speaking of your stable, how is Ailan?

437
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,039
Brother, you haven't been there for a long time.

438
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,780
Ailan is Yue's horse now.

439
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,679
Ailan was given to Mom by Dad.

440
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:57,559
What is my mother's is mine.

441
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,019
There's something wrong with your logic.

442
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:01,480
You can take my things.

443
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,699
But you can't take things from your mom.

444
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:07,160
My stuff and yours are all hers.

445
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,260
Yes, you're right.

446
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,760
Good for you. Good for you.

447
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,860
I propose a toast. Happy Spring Festival.

448
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,739
Happy Spring Festival.

449
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:17,840
Mom. Dad. Let's take a picture.

450
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,799
Okay, let's take a picture.

451
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Raise your glasses.

452
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,380
- Here. 
 - Dad. Mom. Cheers.

453
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,879
- Happy Spring Festival. 
 - Happy Spring Festival.

454
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:27,200
Here come the dumplings.

455
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,520
- Brother. 
 - Here come the dumplings.

456
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,860
- Let's eat some dumplings. 
 - Cheers.

457
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,480
Sister. Dad. Cheers.

458
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,960
I want some dumplings.

459
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,000
I will serve you.

460
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,279
Here.

461
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:16,540
Where are you going? Aren't you going to watch the Spring Festival gala?

462
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,020
No, I want to look at the stars.

463
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,400
Look at the stars in her room?

464
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,880
She's not looking at the stars.

465
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,960
She's going to make phone calls.

466
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,020
Why does she have so many phone calls?

467
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,599
She's making a video call with someone on the Spring Festival's Eve.

468
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,079
Is there something happened?

469
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,580
Take a look.

470
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,560
- Let's go. 
 - In two days?

471
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,900
I'm going to a wedding.

472
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,781
A senior from college is going to get married.

473
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:48,979
Do you have a good relationship?

474
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:51,780
 Yes, we used to hang out in college. 

475
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,280
Do you call him "Senior"?

476
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,440
Isn't he my senior?

477
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,640
What? No one called you senior when you were in college?

478
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,939
Listen to your daughter.

479
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:10,739
The tone of voice when talking to someone on a video call. Why is she like this?

480
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,680
You're right.

481
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,160
There must be something.

482
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,820
You're right.

483
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,799
We now know there's something.

484
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,480
Let's go.

485
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,600
I don't have plans.

486
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,700
I will spend time with my dad and my sister.

487
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,900
 What about your niece? 

488
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,419
She is active and can't sit still.

489
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,199
 What's wrong? 

490
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,759
Nothing.

491
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,139
Shuyi.

492
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,000
Forget it.

493
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,980
What?

494
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,939
Come back early. Okay?

495
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,579
 Okay. 

496
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:54,379
I'll wait for you.

497
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,080
I am going back.

498
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,480
Well.

499
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,660
If you're still up when they're all asleep,

500
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,520
I will call you.

501
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,079
I don't go to bed that early.

502
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,920
 Noted. 

503
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,940
Why didn't you hang up?

504
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,139
 I want you to hang up first. 

505
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,780
I will hang up.

506
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,940
- Happy Spring Festival. 
 - Happy Spring Festival.

507
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,559
About the wedding,

508
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,519
I have to go.

509
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,139
Since I am going,

510
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,800
I must look better than Qin Lezhi.

511
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,980
It's so cute.

512
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,040
- Handsome. 
 - Children bring joy.

513
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,719
I like it.

514
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,599
Uncle, who were you calling?

515
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,219
A friend.

516
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,500
You went outside to talk with your friend.

517
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
And it was a video call.

518
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,860
You chatted for more than 10 minutes.

519
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,760
You didn't call your friend to wish them a happy Spring Festival.

520
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,840
You look happy.

521
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
So it was not about work.

522
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,680
So, it was your girlâ€¦

523
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,960
So, it was your girlâ€¦

524
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,039
Girlfriend.

525
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,760
Really?

526
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,620
How can you admit it so quickly?

527
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,519
Your brother dares to love and hate.

528
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,279
I know who that person is.

529
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,139
Who is she?

530
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,640
Let Shi Yan tell you.

531
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,339
Right?

532
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,700
I'll ask her if she wants to go public.

533
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,219
I can't wait any longer. Just tell us.

534
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:37,599
I can't wait any longer. Just tell us.

535
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,079
Right, Shi Yan.

536
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,440
Just tell us.

537
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,660
Call her now.

538
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,119
Some questions need to be asked in person.

539
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,320
   

540
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,280
Some questions need to be asked in person.

541
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,359
Do you want to play chess?

542
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:17,880
Okay.

543
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,819
We lost two ministers.

544
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,780
Minister.

545
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,559
Minister, You.

546
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,500
We should look for them carefully.

547
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,879
Where are they?

548
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,840
Look at him.

549
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,939
I found them.

550
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:56,860
I got them.

551
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,760
Your mom is worried about you.

552
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,079
She doesn't mean to urge you to get married.

553
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,399
She doesn't want you to miss someone you like.

554
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,360
I know.

555
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,380
Nice move.

556
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,840
Come on.

557
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,199
What do I do?

558
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,840
Checkmate.

559
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,380
Rest early.

560
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,920
- You too, Dad. 
 - Okay.

561
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,760
The older, the wiser.

562
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,719
 My parents used chess to urge me to get married. 

563
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,280
 Been there. 

564
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,220
 Which one is better? 

565
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,679
 Which one should I wear to meet someone important? 

566
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:37,119
It's funny.

567
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,600
Dad. Mr. Guan. Happy Spring Festival.

568
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,940
Sister. Brother. Happy Spring Festival.

569
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,739
I have something to deal with.

570
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,320
It's too early to work.

571
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,660
It's Spring Festival. Have some rest.

572
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,999
Deal with it later.

573
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,260
I'm going out in a couple of days.

574
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,119
Go ahead.

575
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,900
Enjoy yourselves. I'll send electronic red envelopes.

576
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,479
He's up to something.

577
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,300
Where are you going?

578
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,539
I have something to deal with, too.

579
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:10,540
Your mom gave up the chance to go to the Spring Festival gala.

580
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,639
You should spend some time with her.

581
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,400
He's right.

582
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,860
All right. Go ahead.

583
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,080
Thank you, Mom. You are the best.

584
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,379
Grandpa, Dad, Mom, and Guan Ji, excuse me.

585
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:26,540
Happy Spring Festival.

586
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,840
- Happy Spring Festival. 
 - Happy Spring Festival.

587
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:37,600
They are up to something.

588
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,239
I hope you were like them.

589
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,380
Maybe... I could.

590
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,779
What?

591
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,500
Nothing.

592
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,219
Are you seeing someone?

593
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:59,160
You are hiding it from me.

594
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,580
Tell us.

595
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,340
Just tell us. It's fine.

596
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,219
Nothing.

597
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,540
Chase me.

598
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,039
 Baby, look. 

599
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,839
 Isn't it beautiful? 

600
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,540
 Come to Mom. 

601
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,480
 Careful. 

602
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,740
You've been dressed up for a long time.

603
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,880
You are not the bride.

604
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,159
Leave me alone.

605
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,400
 Since I am going to the wedding alone, 

606
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,860
 I have to show some momentum. 

607
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,220
Shuyi, here you are.

608
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,660
Happy marriage, Senior.

609
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,679
You look handsome.

610
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,520
Thank you.

611
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,000
Sorry, I didn't think it through.

612
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,760
What are you talking about?

613
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,699
He should say sorry to me, not you.

614
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,499
I am fine.

615
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:43,539
Oh, right!

616
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:46,860
You will sit with my relatives. You will not meet him.

617
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,840
Thanks.

618
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,380
Qianqian.

619
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,760
- Take Shuyi to sit next to you. Take care of her. 
 - Okay.

620
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,719
Sister Shuyi, come with me.

621
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,100
Shuyi.

622
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,739
Shuyi, here you are.

623
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:09,819
Are you still working at Financial Introduce?

624
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,300
Shuyi, I heard you have interviewed Shi Yan.

625
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,440
Is he handsome?

626
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,380
Really? It's a great job.

627
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:23,540
Shuyi, let's sit there.

628
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,859
Right, we are all at that table. Come with us.

629
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:30,060
- Come on. 
 - Let's go.

630
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:33,199
It's all his fault.

631
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,380
Shuyi, here you are.

632
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,960
Sit down.

633
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,879
Your boyfriend was in the computer science department. Right?

634
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:42,600
He's on good terms with Chen Yueding.

635
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,760
Why didn't you bring him?

636
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,820
We broke up.

637
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,840
I don't know if he's coming.

638
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,820
Brokeâ€¦

639
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:54,199
I thought you wouldn't come.

640
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,619
I didn't do anything wrong.

641
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:57,480
Why shouldn't I come?

642
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,539
You should bring your boyfriend.

643
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,940
You have a boyfriend. Right?
