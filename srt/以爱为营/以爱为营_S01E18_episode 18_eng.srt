 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:31,797
♫  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  ♫

4
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:34,322
♫  Dreams in winter are too fragile  ♫

5
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:38,797
♫  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  ♫

6
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:40,997
♫  Intoxicated under the sunset  ♫

7
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:45,822
♫  The light fades through my fingertips  ♫

8
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:48,322
♫  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  ♫

9
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:50,608
♫  Let time no longer be boring  ♫

10
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:54,047
♫  The evening breeze blows gently  ♫

11
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:57,122
♫  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  ♫

12
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:59,197
♫  A sip of summer intoxication  ♫

13
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:02,622
♫  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  ♫

14
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:06,422
♫  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  ♫

15
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:09,472
♫  Stop frowning  ♫

16

how many times have I fallen for you?  ♫

18
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:20,147
♫  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  ♫

19
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:26,272
♫  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  ♫

♫  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  ♫

♫  You are my treasure, a delusion in the smoke  ♫

27
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,779
I thought you said you wouldn't be back until next week.

28
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,819
Something's come up here.

29
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:09,637
♫  Blooming roses, gorgeous yet wither  ♫

30
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:12,743
♫  Roses exude a drunken intoxication  ♫

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,400
Where's Mr. Chen? He didn't come back with you.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,039
What? You want to see him?

33
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,361
I want to see Chen Sheng? Why do I want to see him?

34
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,565
♫  Roses are the most powerful and most beautiful  ♫

35
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:27,400
♫  Roses carve fearlessness with their domination  ♫

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,439
You're jealous.

37
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,109
Mr. Shi, if there's nothing else, I'll go home.

38
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:41,589
♫  A delusion in the smoke  ♫

39
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:47,598
Why didn't you tell me you were celebrating New Year's Eve with your friends?

40
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,580
♫  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  ♫

41
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:01,163
♫  Bitter and hurt, addicted to gentleness  ♫

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,326
I didn't plan anything special for the day.

43
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,862
But since you were away for business

44
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:21,159
Shanshan and the others thought I'd be lonely so they came to keep me company.

45
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,800
We just went shopping together and we were coming back to eat hotpot.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,900
I didn't know you were coming back early.

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,699
You didn't tell me, did you?

48
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,080
So where are we going now?

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
To go see stars.

50
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,560
But I didn't prepare anything.

51
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,719
I prepared.

52
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,880
 Book me a private room on the top floor. December 31st. 

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,820
 Oh, get me a cart of roses and a card. 

54
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,120
 Bring them here after midnight. 

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
 Okay. Thank you. 

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,100
Mr. Shi, can we serve the food now?

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,279
You had it all planned out.

58
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,899
Then you lied to me about coming back next week.

59
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,879
I didn't lie to you.

60
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,000
So, you flew all the way back to celebrate New Year's Eve with me?

61
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,319
 Professor Yu, Happy New Year 

62
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,000
 Have you eaten? 

63
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,759
 What are you eating? 

64
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,000
Shiyue, let's eat.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,260
Okay, I got it.

66
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,519
Yu You, time for dinner.

67
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,720
 It's New Year's Eve. 

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,779
 Will you eat dumplings on New Year's Eve? 

69
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,099
 What kind of filling do you like? 

70
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,419
 Are you celebrating New Year's Eve with a friend? 

71
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,839
 If you're spending New Year's Eve alone, I can be with you. 

72
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,940
Mom.

73
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,439
I told you it was time to eat several times.

74
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,120
Hurry up, it's getting cold.

75
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm coming.

76
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,519
How's the food today? Is it delicious?

77
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,220
That's good. That's good.

78
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,079
Shiyue, stop playing with your cell phone and eat.

79
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,539
Okay.

80
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,319
You're not going to fall in love on the last day of the year, are you?

81
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,020
What do you know about it, Mr. Playboy?

82
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,879
Let's have a toast. Come on.

83
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,480
Okay. Sure. Come on.

84
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,559
- Happy New Year! 
 - Happy New Year! 
 - Happy New Year!

85
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,920
Did you get anything out of your visit?

86
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,079
So you've decided to give up Zhanlan?

87
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm sorry. I forgot.

88
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,179
You don't talk business on your own time.

89
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,140
It's New Year's Eve.

90
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,839
After tonight, you can ask me anything you want.

91
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:31,839
Eat up.

92
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,500
Mr. Shi, it's almost midnight.

93
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,279
You two can watch the fireworks from the terrace.

94
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,920
It's almost midnight.

95

100
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,510
I guess they're all couples.

101
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:37,621
And a soon-to-be-couple.

102
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,379
Shi Yan, look!

103

We got lucky.

104
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,399
Did you see the stars abroad?

105
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,539
Yes, I did. Every day.

106
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,179
But…

107
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,165

It's a chess game.

Get it.

117
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,779
It's too bad that Dad is away on business.

118
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,539
He won't be with us on New Year's Eve again.

119
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:02,080
Why don't we give him a call and wish him a happy new year?

120
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,520
Yeah, call him now and get him to give me a red packet.

121

Grandpa, I'm still young.

That's right. Our Shiyue is in no hurry.

You didn't go out for New Year's Eve.

I did but I'm back.

162
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:36,465
♫  I can still tightly hold your hand  ♫

163
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:43,259
♫  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  ♫

164
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:50,413
♫  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  ♫

165
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,939
♫  Only you caught me off guard  ♫

166
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,779
Zheng Shuyi, I…

167
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm going to be successful in upgrading my e-magazine this year!

168
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,079
I'm going to write more and better articles.

169
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:16,016
♫  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  ♫

170
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:18,974
♫  Luckily, you didn't go far away  ♫

171
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:26,896
♫  I can still tightly hold your hand  ♫

172
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:33,715
♫  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  ♫

173
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:36,120
♫  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  ♫

174
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,140
Shi Yan…

175
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:42,960
♫  I want to do everything for you  ♫

176
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,800
- I… 
 - Mr. Shi.

177
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,742
Your flowers have arrived.

178
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:55,358
♫  I want to say I'm loving you every morning  ♫

179
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:59,120
Send them to the Shi Residence. Give them to Shi Huaiman.

180
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,421
Okay, Mr. Shi.

181
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:08,664
♫  No matter how windy, snowy, and cold it is, I will give you warmth  ♫

182
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:11,619
​♫  I will give you warmth  ♫

183
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:15,260
That's for your sister?

184
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,060
She likes roses.

185
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,779
 Do you want it to be so realistic? 

186
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,740
 I made a wish on my career and then my relationship… 

187
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,500
 Why on Earth didn't I wish to be with Shi Yan or wish for a successful confession? 

188
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,060
Did you just make a wish?

189
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,720
Yes.

190
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,759
What's your wish.

191
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:52,200
I hope you're successful in upgrading your e-magazine.

192
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,260
Thank you for giving me my wish.

193
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,148
   

194
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,220
 Happy New Year! 

195
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,140
 The fireworks in Jiangcheng are so beautiful. 

196
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,659
 Did you see the fireworks? 

197
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,639
 The fireworks in Qing'an were also very nice. 

198
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,060
 Then, next time can we watch the fireworks together? 

199
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:24,620
 I mean, can I pursue you? 

200
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,519
 We're not right for each other. 

201
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,120
 How do you know if you don't give it a try? 

202
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,839
 There's no need for trial and error in relationships. 

203
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
   

204
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:11,539
Yu You.

205
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:12,200
- Mom. 
 - Who are you texting at this hour?

206
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,699
- Mom. 
 - Who are you texting at this hour?

207
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,419
Your girlfriend?

208
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,219
Just a friend.

209
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,259
Just a friend?

210
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,140
Who are you texting?

211
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,940
Mom.

212
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,839
Your boyfriend?

213
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,000
I'd love it if he was.

214
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,099
Did you text your uncle and wish him a happy new year?

215
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,759
I'm texting him.

216
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,319
Who is she wanting to fall in love with?

217
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,580
Lost her brain in love.

218
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:12,039
♫  You obviously want to get closer  ♫

219
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,119
♫  But your eyes are avoiding me  ♫

220
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,200
Thank you for spending New Year's Eve with me.

221
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,502
I'll go home first.

222
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:23,846
♫  A sincere heart is defined because of you  ♫

223
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:27,895
♫  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  ♫

224
00:18:27,895 --> 00:18:31,825
♫  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  ♫

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,519
Thank you.

226
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:42,568
♫  I will meet the scenes of you  ♫

227
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:46,000
♫  The words that haven’t been spoken yet  ♫

228
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,049
Shuyi!

229
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:50,249
♫  But I'm afraid it's too late  ♫

230
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:55,359
♫  I predicted the rain, but I pretend not to care  ♫

231
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,506
I wish you the best of luck in the new year.

232
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:02,240
♫  The words that haven’t been spoken yet  ♫

233
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,051
♫  The courage to transcend time  ♫

234
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:10,597
♫  Even I end up soaked in the rain  ♫

235
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:12,119
♫  I'll let you know that I'm still where I am  ♫

236
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,480
Let's go.

237
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,840
♫  I'll let you know that I haven't forgotten  ♫

238
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,780
And you, too. That all your wishes come true.

239
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,599
Shi Yan prepared a cart of roses but didn't give them to you.

240
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,400
You were ready to confess, but you didn't?

241
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,939
Didn't I tell you? Let Shi Yan take the initiative.

242
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,939
How can you take the initiative and confess to him?

243
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:50,159
You like him that much?

244
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,860
He is indeed quite attractive to me.

245
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,480
If we don't talk about it and keep this weird balance going.

246
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,279
it's not easy for me.

247
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,580
As soon as I saw him, some words got stranded on my tongue.

248
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,179
Don't worry.

249
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,160
You two haven't known each other long.

250
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,300
He doesn't have a girlfriend and you don't have a boyfriend.

251
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,359
There's still a chance.

252
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,532
 I guess he just came back in a hurry and wasn't ready. 

253
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:20,419
Maybe.

254
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,219
 What did you wish for? 

255
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:26,838
Hopefully, in this year, I'll be able to upgrade to an e-magazine.

256
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:29,079
Zheng Shuyi, are you serious?

257
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,820
The whole terrace was all lovey-dovey, hoping for their love to last.

258
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,100
 Then what were you yelling about? A successful upgrade? 

259
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,560
Ugh, how can Shi Yan confess to you if you behave like that?

260
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,780
It's not that easy to upgrade an e-magazine.

261
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:48,339
But love… if the one you like is around, it's something you can fight for.

262
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,340
You've got a mind of your own. It's really an eye-opener.

263
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:58,620
So you think it's my problem, too.

264
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,119
 If he knows what you're thinking and understands you, then there's no problem. 

265
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,759
But, you know, you're ideas are a bit strange.

266
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,759
I don't think he knows.

267
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,519
 Zheng Shuyi, I… 

268
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,640
 I'm going to be successful in upgrading my e-magazine this year! 

269
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,160
 I'm going to write more and better articles. 

270
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,889
   

271
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,699
She's not asleep yet.

272
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,659
 Thank you for spending New Year's Eve with me. 

273
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,000
 I wish you a happy new year, too. 

274
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,880
Well, that's an overly polite way of putting it.

275
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,920
 Why haven't you gone to sleep? 

276
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,990
 I will be sleeping soon. Happy New Year. 

277
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,920
Happy New Year!

278
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,480
 Professor Yu, what are you going to do today? 

279
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,639
Qin Shiyue, get dressed and go to the stable.

280
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,319
No, I'm not gong.

281
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,519
Not going?

282
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm busy. I'm not going.

283
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,940
This is the only place that's empty on a holiday.

284
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,159
Luckily, you've got Guan Xiangcheng as your best friend.

285
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,559
After my last visit with Shi Yan, Uncle Guan has been trying to get me to come back.

286
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,799
Just the two of us today?

287
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,799
I think so. Let's go.

288
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,620
Where's Shiyue?

289
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,000
She said something came up and she wouldn't have her cell phone.

290
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,359
The little girl has grown up.

291
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,119
I'm afraid there's something big going on.

292
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,319
How was your visit?

293
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,519
Entering the battery industry is imperative.

294
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,880
But Zhanlan is not a good place to start.

295
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,459
If you've made up your mind, why do you still look so distracted?

296
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,880
There's been a lot going on lately.

297
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,960
I went to the mountains a while ago and asked for some.

298
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,580
This one's for you.

299
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,039
You really believe this?

300
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,599
Whatever it is, it's a comforting thought.

301
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,017
In this business, our minds are on a roller coaster all the time. 
    

302
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,017
In this business, our minds are on a roller coaster all the time. 
    

303
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,280
Can I get whatever I'm thinking about?

304
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,039
You could say that.

305
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,079
Whatever you're thinking about it's what's coming.

306
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,700
That one's so red.

307
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,220
Shuyi.

308
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,079
Shi Yan.

309
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,179
What happened to Shi Yan?

310
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,208
   

311
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,919
Go over and say hello.

312
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,580
Okay.

313
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,720
It's a great honor to have two journalists at the stables.

314
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,559
It was a sudden visit. I didn't realize you were here.

315
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,060
We won't disturb you.

316
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,519
You're not disturbing us.

317
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,540
What a coincidence that we all thought of this place.

318
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,259
Since you're here and the farm is big, go ahead and not worry about us.

319
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:36,139
Make yourself at home.

320
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,480
Reporting Bi, this is your first time. Right?

321
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,899
Or I could show you around.

322
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,358
Then I'll have to trouble you.

323
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,839
You're always so busy.

324
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,580
How long has it been since you've been in my humble stable?

325
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,620
A friend of mine gave me a purebred Mongolian horse.

326
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,000
It's a gentle one.

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,080
You'll have a good ride later.

328
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,939
Good. I haven't been here in a while either.

329
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:21,419
I've got to get a good ride in today.

330
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,079
Guan Ji and Shi Yan have brought their friends here again.

331
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,000
Let's go. Say hello.

332
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,640
I think it's Shuyi.

333
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,880
Isn't this perfect? We all know each other.

334
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,260
I think they're having fun.

335
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,459
I'm afraid we'll disturb them if we go over there.

336
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,279
You're right.

337
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,759
Then let's leave them alone.

338
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,139
I'll take you to the winery. Try the new arrivals.

339
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:10,479
Sure. We can come back any time.

340
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,740
You're always welcome. Go, go, go. This way, this way.

341
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,800
I read that piece you wrote for my dad a while back.

342
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
It was good.

343
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,599
I want to be interviewed, too.

344
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,100
I just don't deserve it yet. I have to work harder.

345
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,499
I'm flattered.

346
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,839
Uncle Guan shared many great stories.

347
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,799
I merely basked in his light.

348
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,240
I'm not flattering you.

349
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,459
Since you can handle Shi Yan, you're definitely brilliant.

350
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,060
Go over there and take a look.

351
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,160
The stables are dirty.

352
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,300
Wait here for a minute. I'll go get your horses.

353
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,839
Don't be afraid. This horse is very gentle.

354
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,519
It's showing its affection.

355
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,300
Affection?

356
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,419
Depends on who's riding it.

357
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:55,780
Doudou, be nice to me this time, please.

358
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:07,140
This horse has been with me since we were kids.

359
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,880
When it meets a beautiful woman, it'll be even more nice and gentle.

360
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,080
I selected it just for you.

361
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,259
Trust me. I'll protect you.

362
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,419
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

363
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,208
Prepare the saddle.

364
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,279
Let's go.

365
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,299
Why don't you guys go to the locker room?

366
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:39,799
I'm here to play today, too.

367
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:43,060
I've got nothing better to do than to teach you.

368
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,939
You're idle.

369
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,219
What are you doing here?

370
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,720
You don't own the stable.

371
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,519
But I can keep you from coming in.

372
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,860
Stop joking. That's not funny.

373
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,680
Since you're Shi Yan's friends then you're my friends.

374
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,900
Make yourselves at home. Enjoy.

375
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,519
Really?

376
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,440
When did our relationship become so good?

377
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,899
Yeah, we are not familiar with each other.

378
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:33,139
It’s not a good idea to trouble you like this.

379
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:34,699
What's wrong with it?

380
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,480
Since my dad invited you here,

381
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,119
then of course I have to receive you properly.

382
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,179
Come on, I'll show you to the locker room.

383
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:42,100
Thank you.

384
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,179
 Mr. Guan invited me. 

385
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,819
 What's the matter? 

386
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,279
What's between you and Shi Yan?

387
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,419
I don't know what's wrong with him.

388
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:04,260
He…

389
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,559
From what you said yesterday, you two were this close to confessing.

390
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,880
But it still feels like it's a long way off.

391
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,980
I have no idea.

392
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,079
You can't drop the ball all of a sudden.

393
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,740
And I can tell he cares about you.

394
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,177
The clothes are ready. You can go in and change.

395
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,459
What the hell is wrong with you?

396
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:40,048
They came to see you on a holiday.

397
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,499
They didn't get in your way at all.

398
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,100
One of them even wrote a nice article about you.

399
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,580
Why are you making such a bad face?

400
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,854
They'll be out in a minute. Don't be like that.

401
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:52,700
Ride with them around a bit.

402
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,419
Be friendly.

403
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,799
 Shi Yan is a man after all. 

404
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,820
 Maybe he's just mad you came to the track without telling him. 

405
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,699
But the fact that he's mad means he cares about you.

406
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:15,620
Wait until he's over it, flirt a little, and he's still yours.

407
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,079
Does flirting really work?

408
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,519
Why aren't they out yet?

409
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:37,780
Shi Yan.

410
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:01,000
It's over.

411
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,860
Shuyi, I didn't know Shi Yan was out there.

412
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,799
Let me get changed and go explain that we were just kidding around.

413
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,719
There's no need.

414
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,480
People only believe what they want to believe.

415
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,019
If he wants to believe me, he'll ask me himself.

416
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,760
If he wants to believe what he's hearing, it's no use explaining it to him.

417
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,079
No, but you have to make it clear.

418
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,799
How else can you go further?

419
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,020
When someone doesn't want to go further with you,

420
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,980
it's not just because they heard something.

421
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,279
Maybe it's just thatthey doesn't feel that way about you.

422
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,580
Come to think of it, we haven't known each other that long.

423
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,039
I don't know him at all.

424
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,140
 He's like a kite to me. 

425
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,019
He's close this moment and the next moment he's far away.

426
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,680
I can't figure him out at all.

427
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,800
Shu…

428
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,860
You... didn't tie the scarf right.

429
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,920
Thank you.

430
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,320
Where's Ms. Zheng?

431
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,157
Yesterday, we were texting each other but today we don't know each other anymore?

432
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:20,350
♫  I just simply like you  ♫

433
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,939
♫  I'm just a little more possessive  ♫

434
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:26,320
Say something.

435
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:34,609
♫  If love is like a cloud  ♫

436
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,672
♫  Always erratic  ♫

437
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:43,347
♫  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  ♫

438
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:47,469
♫  Get a taste of the rain that hasn't yet condensed  ♫

439
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:49,714
♫  I will also be cautious  ♫

440
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,922
♫  I will also be breathless  ♫

441
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:56,960
 What does that mean? 

442
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,485
♫  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  ♫

443
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:03,730
♫  We met, we fell in love  ♫

444
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,730
♫  No need to ask, I am willing  ♫

445
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:12,499
Why are you so slow?

446
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:14,619
Ms. Zheng is still not ready?

447
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,959
Shuyi takes things slow.

448
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:24,139
Why don't we ride and wait?

449
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,360
I'll take Ms. Bi for a ride first.

450
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,639
It's beautiful.

451
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,039
You think it's beautiful?

452
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,559
Yeah.

453
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,619
This is the first time I've heard someone praise Azure Cloud like this.

454
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:50,260
Azure Cloud?

455
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,960
Why is it called Azure Cloud?

456
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,380
Its eyes don't seem to be azure.

457
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,140
You'll see.

458
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,739
Get on the horse.

459
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,420
Take it easy.

460
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,280
Hands on the saddle.

461
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,679
Don't sway your body from side to side.

462
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,939
Relax your thighs.

463
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:33,380
Don't push on your knees and calves.

464
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,780
Just stick them lightly to Azure Cloud.

465
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,479
Guan Ji.

466
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,519
Why do you like riding horses?

467
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,939
Because I like the feeling of not being tied down.

468
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:09,180
The freedom. Unlimited proximity to flying.

469
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
I like freedom, too.

470
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,320
You can come back more often if you like.

471
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,300
 Slow down a bit. 

472
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,471
 Slow down. 

473
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:55,159
 Slow down. Slow down. 

474
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,599
Let's ride.

475
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,500
No.

476
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,990
I'm just here to let off steam today.

477
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,820
I don't want to get on a horse.

478
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:12,060
Are you going to do it yourself or should I help you?

479
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,400
Isn't there any normal choice?

480
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,880
Then you can carry me like carrying a princess.

481
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,039
I don't want to bother you.

482
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,360
Of course, I can get on the horse myself.

483
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,879
 Silence is the true color of Shi Yan. 

484
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,679
You're not sitting right. Sit up straight.

485
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,119
The sun sets are good.

486
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,699
But the nights are closing in.

487
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,920
Doudou is so nice today.

488
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,880
Much nicer than when we first met.

489
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,599
It didn't know you yet, so it had a temper.

490
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,039
However, you…

491
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,700
It was our first interview yet you had to come into the stable with me.

492
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,400
Why did you go to such lengths to get close to me?

493
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,880
 He did hear me. 

494
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:57,860
At first, I did it for the interview.

495
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,139
Cloud Innovation has so much potential and you're so mysterious.

496
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:04,000
That interview was very important to me.

497
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:06,239
"At first"?

498
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,499
What happened afterward?

499
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,574
♫  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  ♫

500
00:42:17,574 --> 00:42:20,474

 "Passerby" - Zhou Shen 

503
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:48,005
♫  Being emotional is accidental. I acted in the wrong role  ♫

504
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:54,934
♫  Can a happy ending be fixed?  ♫

505
00:42:54,934 --> 00:42:58,505
♫  Meeting you, approaching you  ♫

506
00:42:58,505 --> 00:43:02,493
♫  Falling in love with you, losing you  ♫

507
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:09,820
♫  You left by yourself and left me where I was standing  ♫

508
00:43:11,518 --> 00:43:16,312
♫  Let the tears struggle and fall  ♫

509
00:43:16,312 --> 00:43:22,201
♫  Are you just a passerby from now on?  ♫

510
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:28,459
♫  My heart feels like it has fallen off a cliff  ♫

511
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:30,743
♫  Does it hurt  ♫

512
00:43:30,743 --> 00:43:36,956
♫  Love always makes people sink like quicksand  ♫

513
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:42,482
♫  The closer I get, the more I can't extricate myself  ♫

514
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,596
♫  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  ♫

515
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:51,932
♫  The more I pretend to be cool, the harder it is to let go  ♫

516
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:05,963
♫  Do you want to let go like this?  ♫

517
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:07,677
♫  Does it hurt  ♫

518
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:14,611
♫  We're clearly already trapped in quicksand  ♫

519
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:21,119
♫  Don't say you were never afraid  ♫

520
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:26,591
♫  Don't say you can let go  ♫

521
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:32,697
♫  Don't go far, okay?  ♫
