 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,525
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,675
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,888
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,225
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,599
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,950
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,425
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,450
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,585
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,945
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,500
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,250
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,925
   

21
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:39,111
   

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,360
It was the first interview, and you followed me into the stable.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,079
Why did you try to get close to me?

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,699
 He heard it. 

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,559
At first, I did that for the interview.

26
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:59,860
Cloud Innovation has so much potential. And you are mysterious.

27
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,580
That interview was important for me.

28
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,920
At first?

29
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,180
What about after that?

30
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,639
Thenâ€¦

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,860
After getting to know you,

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,775
I found that you were handsome, talented, capable,

33
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,580
and the dream lover of many women in Jiangcheng.

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,660
I am also one of them.

35
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:26,068
So, I couldn't help myself but get close to you.

36
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,619
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

37
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:34,819
Didn't you feel my sincerity?

38
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,420
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape...  â™«

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,220
 From what you said yesterday, you two were this close to confessing. 

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,600
 But it still feels like it's a long way off. 

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,081
 You can't drop the ball all of a sudden. 

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,460
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

43
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,600
It's okay if you don't feel it.

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,199
One day you will feel it.

45
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,129
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

46
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:15,129
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

47
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,850
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

48
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,075
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

49
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:30,400
 Zheng Shuyi, I'll wait for you until you are totally open to me. 

50
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,120
Ms. Zheng, how do you like it?

51
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,200
Doudou is docile.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,539
Mr. Shi took care of me. I am very happy.

53
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:58,600
Yeah. His equestrian skills are on par with professional athletes.

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,339
I learned about Mr. Shiâ€™s equestrian skills from last time.

55
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:06,680
They are truly unrivaled and unprecedented.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,339
I see.

57
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,377
Shanshan, how was it? Did you have fun?

58
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:17,680
Not bad.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,420
But after an afternoon of riding, I am exhausted.

60
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,739
I want to go home.

61
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,120
I want to go back, too.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,800
How about I send you home?

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,299
Mr. Shi, please send Shuyi home.

64
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,360
Okay.

65
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,140
 Professor Yu, are you free now? 

66
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,959
 Sorry, I just checked my phone. 

67
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,539
 Do you want to have dinner together? 

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,559
 I haven't gone back to Jiangcheng yet. 

69
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:28,100
 All right. I am waiting for you. 

70
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,619
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

71
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,292
 I got close to a man with a purpose, 

72
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:58,987
 but I fell in love with him. 

73
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:01,920
 Will he accept and forgive me? 

74
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,559
What a stupid question.

75
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,480
Who would forgive a liar?

76
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:14,660
 For my job, 

77
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,119
 I got close to an elite player in the industry. 

78
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:20,839
 I thought I could get what I wanted easily. 

79
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,380
 I thought I could get what I wanted easily. 

80
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,860
 But in my work with him, 

81
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,480
 I was attracted by his professionalism, demeanor, and talent. 

82
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
 And then I fell in love with him. 

83
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,480
 I wanted to be honest with him that I had ulterior motives, 

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,440
 not just for my job. 

85
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,439
 But I don't want to be a stranger to him. 

86
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,560
 What should I do? 

87
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:34,107
How's the wine?

88
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,533
It tastes great.

89
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,889
It's mellow and sweet.

90
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:48,335
The older the wine, the mellower it gets.

91
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,510
What do you want to say?

92
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:03,340
We're both too old to be crazy in love.

93
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,500
We stay together out of reason and love.

94
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,560
So, after we passed the run-in period,

95
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,279
I have been thinking and planning for our future.

96
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,959
I am ready.

97
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,900
Ms. Tang, what about you?

98
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,619
What do you say?

99
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,765
Old Guan,

100
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:58,743
thank you for taking our relationship seriously.

101
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:01,340
I'd love to be with you.

102
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,960
But...

103
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,649
about the future you just talked about,

104
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,451
I think we should think it through.

105
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,660
It's my problem.

106
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,720
You know, I've never been married, and I don't have a lot of relationships.

107
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,979
I'm not sure if I can cope with those problems in the future.

108
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:29,440
I'm not sure if I can be a good Mrs. Guan.

109
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:38,739
Are you talking to me or yourself?

110
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,759
I think these are all my problems.

111
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,979
You are the chief editor.

112
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,300
You deal with numerous affairs every day.

113
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,280
You're good at handling all kinds of work.

114
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,059
But you're worried that you can't be a good Mrs. Guan.

115
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:59,259
- I thinkâ€¦ 
 - It's not your style, Tang Yi.

116
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,340
You have concerns.

117
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,591
You should have faith in me.

118
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,840
Your concerns you mentioned are unnecessary.

119
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,099
Don't pamper me.

120
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,984
I didn't.

121
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:26,080
Did I?

122
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:35,420
You're too mature and thoughtful.

123
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,900
You always think too much.

124
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,560
You will mistreat yourself and the people around you.

125
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,940
When it comes to a relationship,

126
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,240
we should learn from young people. Right?

127
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,820
Like Shi Yan and Shuyi,

128
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,339
we should say our love out loud, get along happily, and cherish each other.

129
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,020
Why should we worry so much?

130
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,440
I am not as brave as them.

131
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,888
Maybe I'm too old.

132
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,919
But in my eyes,

133
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,079
you're still a young girl.

134
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,040
I mean it. Don't worry too much.

135
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,320
Mom, I am back.

136
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,642
You're back.

137
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:23,860
Great. Let's have dinner.

138
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,180
Okay.

139
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,640
Where is my dad?

140
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,580
Your dad went to a reunion with his classmates.

141
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,580
- Just a little for me. 
 - Okay.

142
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,819
Give it to me.

143
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,280
How are you getting along with Mrs. Wang's daughter?

144
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,200
Mrs. Wang's daughter?

145
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,645
It's Shuyi.

146
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,480
I see.

147
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,799
Mom, why are you asking that?

148
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,279
Mrs. Wang called me.

149
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,339
She mentioned you.

150
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,979
She said she likes you.

151
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,340
And I like Shuyi.

152
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,934
Of course, it's your business.

153
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:11,020
I think if you have feelings for each other,

154
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,079
you should speed things up.

155
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,820
Think about it. We know each other's families.

156
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,520
If you get marriedâ€¦

157
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,940
Mom,

158
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,899
I am not that close to Shuyi.

159
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,340
You didn't reject her.

160
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,887
It means you like Shuyi.

161
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,609
Speed things up.

162
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,980
 You didn't reject her. 

163
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,219
 It means you like Shuyi. 

164
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:49,820
 Speed things up. 

165
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,728
   

166
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
 How was your New Year's holiday? 

167
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,500
 Like a roller coaster. 

168
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,000
 It was colorful. 

169
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,800
 What about you? 

170
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,500
 Not bad. I went back to Qing'an to visit my parents. 

171
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Hello, Ms. Yi.

172
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,700
 Hello, Shuyi. 

173
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,400
I heard you are seeing Shi Yan.

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Who said that?

175
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,600
You really are seeing him.

176
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,900
No.

177
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,100
That's right?

178
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,000
Didn't youâ€¦

179
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,600
 Where did you get that? 

180
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I'm not seeing him. It's not true.

181
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
I have to go. Good night.

182
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
 Heyâ€¦ 

183
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,100
I want to be with him.

184
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,600
 Sorry, I just got a call. 

185
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 No worries. It's late. 

186
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
 Good night. 

187
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
 Good night. 

188
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,400
 -   
 -   

189
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,100
Uncle.

190
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
What's the matter?

191
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,300
Did you fall out of love?

192
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,400
What kind of relationship problems are you having?

193
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,800
I can give you some advice.

194
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,500
Go to bed.

195
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Who made you so miserable?

196
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,900
Tell me.

197
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,400
I am a woman.

198
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,200
I know women better than you do.

199
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,900
Doesn't she like you?

200
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
Did she stand you up?

201
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Did she lie to you?

202
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,600
If a woman lies to you, she either doesn't like you

203
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,800
or she loves you too much.

204
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,000
You are charming.

205
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,700
She must love you too much. So she lied to you.

206
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,100
She hides something from you.

207
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,400
She must think that would ruin her image in your mind.

208
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,000
She cares so much about what you think.

209
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
She must love you too much.

210
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,400
 People only believe what they want to believe. 

211
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,800
 If he believes me, he will ask me. 

212
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,000
 If he believes what he hears, 

213
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I don't have to explain. 

214
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,700
 If a person doesn't want to go further with you, 

215
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,600
 it's not because of some words they heard. 

216
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,900
 Maybe they just don't want to go further with you. 

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is that all you've learned from working at Financial Introduce?

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,700
You need to work tomorrow. Sleep early.

219
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,100
So, what I said was right.

220
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,100
Who made him so miserable?

221
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,400
   

222
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Comrade Old Guan, you're too comfortable.

223
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,900
You are back.

224
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,500
You went to the stables?

225
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
What? Did something happen?

226
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,200
What about you?

227
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,500
What made you so happy?

228
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,700
I'll introduce you to someone in a few days.

229
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,200
Is that person my stepmother?

230
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,700
I'll give it a guess. She must be young and beautiful.

231
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,300
You are an old cow eating tender grass.

232
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,000
Who's an old cow?

233
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,800
All right.

234
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,600
I will meet her.

235
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,400
I'll let you meet when she wants to meet you.

236
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,000
When she wants to meet me?

237
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Could it be that you are a spare tire?

238
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,800
What are you talking nonsense about?

239
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,800
She has her concerns.

240
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I respect her.

241
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,200
I am willing to wait for her.

242
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,800
Concerns?

243
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Is that about me?

244
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Do you like her?

245
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
What do you think?

246
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,100
I want to spend the rest of my life with her.

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
I see.

248
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,500
Dad,

249
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,000
I want you to be with the person you love.

250
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,100
I want you to be happy.

251
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
Hello, Old Guan.

252
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
 Yi, I want to talk to you. 

253
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,300
Just say it.

254
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,200
 Guan Ji, this kid, has really grown up. 

255
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,800
Then you don't have to worry about him.

256
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,000
 Yes. 

257
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,800
 You don't need to worry about him. 

258
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
 Let's have dinner another day. 

259
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,800
 I'll officially introduce you to him. 

260
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Okay, I will check my schedule.

261
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
Bye-bye.

262
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,500
- You look good. 
 - Good? There they are.

263
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,800
Hello, I am Cheng Xing.

264
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,600
This is my partner, Hao Wangshu.

265
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,900
Hello, I am Shi Yan.

266
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,300
You are young and promising. I am Guan Ji.

267
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,400
I am Yu You, nice to meet you.

268
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,400
The company is well-managed.

269
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,600
The company looks vigorous.

270
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
It's all Cheng Xing's credit.

271
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,100
He's in charge of management and business.

272
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,800
Stop that.

273
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Wangshu is in charge of Technology R&amp;D and upgrading.

274
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Technology is Juhe's core competitiveness.

275
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,300
She will tell you about it.

276
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
This way, please. I'll show you around our lab.

277
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,700
Please.

278
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Your lab is big.

279
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,600
Why do you need investment?

280
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,200
To be honest, we invested almost all the money we made in the lab.

281
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Now there are breakthroughs in some technologies. We are in dire need of financial support.

282
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
That way we can do more about it.

283
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
This way, please.

284
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Check it out. It's our company's latest invention.

285
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,900
Please.

286
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,000
We spend most of our time in the lab

287
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
and occasionally go out on business.

288
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,800
We rarely spend time in the office.

289
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,300
So we cut down on office space to save money.

290
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,400
I checked your research stages and your results.

291
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,200
You are leading in the country.

292
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Many people are optimistic about you.

293
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,600
According to you, you should be doing well.

294
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,100
Professor Yu, are you asking why we don't have any money?

295
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,000
Wangshu and I are young and inexperienced.

296
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
Our production scale is small.

297
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,400
Most investment firms surveyed us and believed that we were not profitable.

298
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,000
Especially, we invested most of our energy and profits in technology.

299
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So we couldn't increase our market share.

300
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,200
I heard you both graduated from the University of Science and Technology.

301
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes, we are classmates.

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,800
We were like-minded when we were in college.

303
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,400
When we graduated, we wanted to go to a big company like Zhanlan.

304
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,000
After consideration, we thought we should start our own business.

305
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We are aware of your situation.

306
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,900
After we get back, Cloud Innovation's evaluation team will make an assessment.

307
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,800
There will be a project team to follow up.

308
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,600
Yu You will produce a detailed report.

309
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
Mr. Shi, there's something I want to say now.

310
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,800
We want to break through the technology first.

311
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,200
When we reach the industry-leading position, we will expand production.

312
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,500
No problem.

313
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,000
We have reached a consensus on this.

314
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We like strong teams and businesses.

315
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,600
We value quality more than production.

316
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Only with leading technology can production grow.

317
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Shuyi, are you going back to Wucheng during the Spring Festival holiday?

318
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
No.

319
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,800
Why?

320
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,000
Because I am not from Wucheng.

321
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
I made a mistake.

322
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,100
There are many beauties in Wucheng.

323
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,600
I always thought you were from Wucheng.

324
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,900
Did she say that just to flatter you?

325
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
What's wrong with her?

326
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,100
I don't know.

327
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,300
But she reminded me that the Spring Festival is coming in a few days.

328
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Right.

329
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
I'll book a ticket home.

330
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,200
I'll check the ticket.

331
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:50,000
   

332
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,400
Hi, Mom, what's going on?

333
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,300
 Yi, have you met Yu You recently? 

334
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
Mom, I am working.

335
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,800
I know.

336
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I wonder how you are getting along.

337
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,100
Please don't push me.

338
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,800
I didn't.

339
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,100
Yu You is a good lad.

340
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,300
 Mom. First, I am busy at work. 

341
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,600
 Second, I have a boyfriend. 

342
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800
He'll get mad if I see another man.

343
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,100
Who's your boyfriend? That financial guy?

344
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
I am sticking with him.

345
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,800
Stop it.

346
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
I know you well.

347
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,900
 You said you had a boyfriend. 

348
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,700
 But you never posted his pictures on Moments or brought him home. 

349
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,400
Is he ugly?

350
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,800
 That's impossible. You have good taste like me. 

351
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200
I really have a boyfriend.

352
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Why don't you believe me?

353
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
Then bring him home during the Spring Festival.

354
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,600
He is busy.

355
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 Really? 

356
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,200
 How old is he? 

357
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,300
27.

358
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,800
What does he do?

359
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,600
 He is a businessman. 

360
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,600
Send me a picture of him.

361
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,400
 You don't have his picture? 

362
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,500
 I knew you were lying. 

363
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,200
I will send it to you later. I am busy. I have to go.

364
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,800
Youâ€¦

365
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
 Where is his picture? 

366
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,800
 Show me. 

367
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,200
 I wonder if he's as handsome as Yu You. 

368
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,800
Regardless of anything else,

369
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
just based on his looks,

370
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
it's good for me to have him as a boyfriend.

371
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
 Check it out. This is your future son-in-law. 

372
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,200
 Nonsense. 

373
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,300
 I was a college teacher. 

374
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,800
 And I surf the internet. 

375
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,000
 You underestimate me by fooling me like that. 

376
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,300
 Ask Yu You out this weekend. 

377
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,400
 Otherwise, you know what will happen. 

378
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,400
 Professor Yu, are you free this weekend? 

379
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,300
 I want to invite you to dinner. 

380
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,600
Sister Shuyi, what's going on?

381
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Do you have any problems at work?

382
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,200
Work is never a problem for me.

383
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,000
It's my mother.

384
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
She asked me to go on a blind date again.

385
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,100
You're going on a blind date?

386
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,900
Is it the blind date who is as good as that "uncle"?

387
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,600
Aren't you going toâ€¦

388
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
My mom forced me.

389
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,400
We are going to meet this weekend. I don't want to go.

390
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,100
Then don't.

391
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,200
We made an appointment to go to the spa on Sunday.

392
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,700
You don't understand my troubles.

393
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,800
Does your mom want you to get married soon?

394
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
She totally ships us.

395
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,300
She thinks he's good.

396
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,600
and we are perfect for each other.

397
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,400
What does he do?

398
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,600
He's a college professor.

399
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,700
Why is everyone a college professor?

400
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:20,799
Nothing.

401
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,000
Which subject does he teach?

402
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
- Finance. 
 - Finance?

403
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,100
He's a good match for you.

404
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,000
You'll have a lot in common.

405
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,000
If you meet him, what about that "uncle"?

406
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,500
 If I tell Shi Yan, that I am forced to go on a blind dateâ€¦ 

407
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,800
 Shi Yan, my mom forced me to go on a blind date. 

408
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,400
 Weâ€¦ 

409
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,600
 Shuyi, don't go. 

410
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,700
 No. 

411
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,300
 That's not Shi Yan's style. 

412
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,300
 I couldn't disobey my mother. 

413
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
 I have to go on blind dates. Weâ€¦ 

414
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,100
 I won't let you. 

415
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,600
 I'll tell your mother everything. 

416
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
 And stop it. 

417
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,300
 It's useless. 

418
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,000
 Anyway, 

419
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I won't allow my girlfriend to go on a blind date. 

420
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,700
 No. 

421
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,800
 With Shi Yan's personality, even if I tell him about it, 

422
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,100
 he willâ€¦ 

423
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,400
 Shi Yan, my mom forced me to go on a blind date. 

424
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,200
 Go for it, Ms. Zheng. 

425
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,200
Sister Shuyi.

426
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Yue, didn't we make an appointment to go to the spa on Sunday?

427
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,000
Would you like to have dinner with me?

428
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,200
Sister Shuyi, you are going on a blind date.

429
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,700
But you brought me with you.

430
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,400
I don't think it's appropriate.

431
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,600
It's appropriate.

432
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,000
It's not appropriate if I come alone.

433
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,599
I see.

434
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,800
You want to be Aunt-in-law.

435
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,000
- Here we are. 
 - Okay.

436
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,600
Sister Shuyi, is your blind date Professor Yu?

437
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,600
Yes.

438
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
Shuyi.

439
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,600
Sorry, I am late.

440
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,000
That's all right. I came early.

441
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,500
She is intern Qin Shiyue.

442
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Her family didn't prepare her meals. So I brought her here.

443
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,100
Yue, he is Professor Yu.

444
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,800
Professor Yu, nice to meet you.

445
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,400
Nice to meet you. Sit down.

446
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,720
Shuyi, I wanted to have dinner with you a while ago.

447
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,440
I read your article about Zhanlan. It's great.

448
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,540
My friends and I learned a lot from it.

449
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,880
I am flattered.

450
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,680
Your point of view is unique and sharp as usual.

451
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,360
You must have done a lot of research.

452
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,400
You made me feel inadequate.

453
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I did do a lot of research.

454
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,059
And I went to Zhanlan in person.

455
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,880
 When he sends me messages via WeChat, it's a word or two. 

456
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,740
 I wish he could send some atmosphere over here. 

457
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,160
 But he has endless things to say to Sister Shuyi. 

458
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,959
Professor Yu, I came here because my mom forced me.

459
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:58,459
My mom pushed me to have dinner with you.

460
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,600
I am only 25.

461
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,099
I don't want to go on a blind date.

462
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:04,700
You are still young. I am 30 years old.

463
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,940
So my mom is anxious.

464
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,999
But I am not anxious.

465
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,120
I don't have the energy for a relationship.

466
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,979
And I don't want to work on a relationship or a marriage.

467
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:18,840
I understand.

468
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:25,600
   

469
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,600
Shi Yan.

470
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,680
Dad, what's going on?

471
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,500
The dinner is ready.

472
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,840
Shi Yan,

473
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,319
I heard you are still seeing that actress.

474
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,019
Where did you hear that from?

475
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,419
So what is really going on?

476
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,160
She's a journalist.

477
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,740
She just loves to act.

478
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,339
Calling her an actress insults the profession.

479
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,200
All right.

480
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,200
Why isn't Yue back?

481
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:14,421
Excuse me, I have to answer this.

482
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,480
Hello, Grandpa.

483
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,619
Yue, are you eating with your leader?

484
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:27,080
I'm accompanying her on a blind date.

485
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,139
Yue, your leader is just twoor three years older than you.

486
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,460
She started going on blind dates.

487
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,119
What about you?

488
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,060
 They are intellectuals. 

489
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,680
 They have a lot of knowledge. 

490
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,420
 One of them writes essays and the other writes interviews. 

491
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,239
 They are perfect for each other. 

492
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,979
Even if I wanted to get married, no one would marry me.

493
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:57,180
No one loves me but you.

494
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,520
Qin Shiyue, don't talk about people behind their backs.

495
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,719
Where is Sister Shuyi?

496
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,859
She went to the bathroom.

497
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,122
Professor Yu.

498
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,520
Youâ€¦ You like Sister Shuyi?

499
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,280
In fact, I really admire girls like Shuyi.

500
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,880
 I was right. 

501
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,059
But a relationship is a matter of two people.

502
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,639
Shuyi doesn't want to be with me.

503
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,359
I'll try to get along with her as a friend.

504
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,960
Wellâ€¦

505
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,080
What do you think of me?

506
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,239
I am sorry.

507
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,539
 How's the dinner? 

508
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,920
 Meet him again next week. 

509
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,000
 Don't just eat. 

510
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,680
 I found a good activity. See an exhibit. 

511
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,940
 Cultivate your taste. 

512
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,960
What's wrong, Sister Shuyi?

513
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,759
Nothing.

514
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,091
My mom wants me to invite you to an exhibit.

515
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,300
Don't worry. I will reject her.

516
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,260
I think you should go to the exhibit.

517
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,920
Sister Shuyi, think about it.

518
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,820
If your mom says to go and you keep saying no.

519
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,400
She will have a hundred words waiting for you.

520
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,579
So, just go.

521
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,559
Then she won't bother you anymore.

522
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:01,480
In the long run, it will save you a lot of trouble.

523
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,380
Professor Yu, will you be free?

524
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,179
I am free.

525
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,439
It's not appropriate for the two of us to go.

526
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,620
Then we can go together.

527
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,239
Let's do what you said.

528
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,239
Then it's settled.

529
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,599
Okay.

530
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,000
Thank you for sending me home.

531
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,339
I have a car. I should do that.

532
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:46,200
Shuyi, I have a question for you.

533
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,560
It may be a little abrupt. I hope you don't mind.

534
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,840
Just ask.

535
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,940
Have you been single for a long time?

536
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,419
It's been awhile.

537
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:00,340
 Yue Xingzhou, this scumbag, is not a human being. 

538
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,759
 He doesn't count. 

539
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:05,840
You must have a lot of suitors.

540
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,160
Is there a man who is impossible to be with you?

541
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,419
Kind of.

542
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,960
Since our families are pushing us, we could tell them

543
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,800
that we are seeing each other, but we need to know more about each other.

544
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,020
That way, they won't push us, and they won't arrange new blind dates for us.

545
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,700
What do you say?

546
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,760
I think it's great.

547
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,499
It's good for you, good for me, and good for our moms.

548
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,000
It's a good idea.

549
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
- That's a deal. 
 - Okay.

550
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,600
- Take care. Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

551
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,611
Zheng Shuyi.

552
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,639
 No. 

553
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,239
 Could it be that he saw everything? 

554
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,140
What are you doing here?

555
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,680
What do you think?

556
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,479
That was my mom's colleague's son. We are high school alumni.

557
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:37,720
We only had dinner together. My colleague was with us.

558
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,080
Old friend, huh?

559
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,320
Yes.

560
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,820
I thought you went on a blind date.

561
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,280
 My god. 

562
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,820
 What's wrong with him? 

563
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,280
 How could he know that? 

564
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,240
It was not a blind date. How could I go on a blind date?

565
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,880
Come on.

566
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,280
It's the weekend. I was catching up with an old friend.

567
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,839
Catch up with an old friend? You must be idle.

568
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,619
 Why should I be angry with him? 

569
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,800
 Shi Yan never talks like a normal person. 

570
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,019
 He's upset. He's jealous. 

571
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,819
â™«  It's your shining eyes  â™«

572
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:30,350
â™«  That lights up my universe  â™«

573
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,139
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

574
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,379
I had some leisure time.

575
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:37,739
And I had no one to accompany me.

576
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,550
Zheng Shuyi.

577
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,299
I will not wait.

578
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:52,400
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

579
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,660
 I don't care why you approached me. 

580
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,039
 I will accept it all. 

581
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,819
 I can't wait any longer. 

582
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:05,750
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

583
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:12,159
â™«  No matter how windy, snowy, and cold it is, I will give you warmth  â™«

584
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,759
Shi Yan, are you jealous?

585
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:24,375
â€‹â™«  I will give you warmth  â™«

586
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,020
Answer it.

587
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,160
 Good evening, Ms. Zheng Shuyi. 

588
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,599
 I am from Mankalina Beauty Center. 

589
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,819
 We have an annual event. To give back to old customers, 

590
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:55,059
 we are giving free samples of Hongyanshui to VIPs. 

591
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:58,719
 Are you free next weekend? You can come to have a try. 

592
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,260
Next weekend?

593
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,820
It's all right.

594
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,439
I am free.

595
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:12,679
 Okay. I'll make an appointment for you. 

596
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,639
How is Cloud Innovation's feature going?

597
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,340
Since you are idle, come to Cloud Innovation to work next weekend.

598
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,860
 No. I wanted you to ask me out. 

599
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,140
 But you wanted me to work. 

600
