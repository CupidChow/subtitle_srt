 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,300
♫  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  ♫

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,700
♫  Dreams in winter are too fragile  ♫

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,800
♫  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  ♫

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,400
♫  Intoxicated under the sunset  ♫

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,000
♫  The light fades through my fingertips  ♫

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  ♫

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
♫  Let time no longer be boring  ♫

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
♫  The evening breeze blows gently  ♫

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,200
♫  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  ♫

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,300
♫  A sip of summer intoxication  ♫

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,600
♫  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  ♫

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
♫  Stop frowning  ♫

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,000
♫  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  ♫

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,400
♫  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  ♫

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
♫  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  ♫

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,100
♫  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  ♫

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,100
   

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,100
   

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm going to take a taxi to my hotel.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
This is your hotel.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,300
Zhanlan is just around the corner, so I booked rooms here.

26
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,500
You're going to Zhanlan to interview them, so you're staying here with me.

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,100
I'm staying with you?

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,300
What's wrong? Don't you want to?

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,000
 Will refusing make me look pretentious? 

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,600
 If I don't refuse him, what will he do? 

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,800
Mr. Shi, I don't think that's appropriate.

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,700
What's inappropriate?

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Hello. Your luggage has been delivered.

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,300
Continue. Tell me what's inappropriate.

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,900
It's not appropriate for you to have my card.

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Shanshan, I was just in the car.  Shi Yan was sitting next to me.

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,820
Shanshan, I was just in the car.  Shi Yan was sitting next to me.

38
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,000
 He heard everything you said. 

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,800
That's good. It's just the time to give him a push.

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
 Don't tell me he was not influenced even in that scenario. 

41
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,300
I wouldn't say "not influenced".

42
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,800
 I'm at his hotel right now. 

43
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Then you still have time to call me?

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm in the room across the hall from him.

45
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,100
Shi Yan… is impossible.

46
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,800
What are you talking about?

47
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,200
What happened to you?

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,800
 Don't you know that traveling is the best time for a man and a woman to bond? 

49
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
- You have to hurry. 
 - I'm not talking to you.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,500
I have an interview tomorrow. I'm hanging up.

51
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,600
It's okay.

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. Yu, there's a delivery for you.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,400
Thank you.

54
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,790
   

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
   

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
 Who sent it? 

57
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,000
 But after professional investigation and testing by technicians 

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,400
 they found the accident was not directly related to the quality of the battery itself. 

59
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
    
  Zhanlan Blue has always had very good quality control. 

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,600
 So car owners can rest assured. You can drive without having to worry. 

61
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
They rushed to make PR announcements before the findings were made public.

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,400
I have a feeling it's not that simple.

63
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
 Can you send me your schedule? 

64
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Is she shy?

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,800
   

66
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,100
The day after tomorrow. Zhanlan.

67
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
- Hello. 
  - Ms. Zheng, how are you? 

68
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
 I'm Mr. Jiang's secretary. 

69
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,600
 I'm confirming the appointment with you. 

70
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,800
 Could you tell me when you'll arrive tomorrow so I can make arrangements to receive you? 

71
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm already in town.

72
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,000
My apologies… I have something else to do tomorrow.

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Can we reschedule the interview for the day after tomorrow?

74
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,600
 Just a moment, I'll check Mr. Jiang's itinerary. 

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,500
 No problem. Then we'll change it to 10:00 a.m. the day after tomorrow. 

76
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,600
 - Do you think it's okay?  
 - Yes, thank you.

77
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
 Mr. Shi, you'll review the commercial contract tomorrow morning. 

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,200
 After noon, we can first go to understand Zhanlan and the city where Zhanlan is located. 

79
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
 Sure. 

80
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,400
 See you in the afternoon. 

81
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,500
 Go to bed early. Good night. 

82
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,300
 Good night. 

83
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Cheers.

84
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,100
Tell me. What kind of relationship problem are you having?

85
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,200
In all the time I've known you, you've never asked me out for a drink.

86
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Since you asked me out and not Shi Yan, it's probably because of a relationship problem.

87
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Then I'll be honest.

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,300
Actually, I'd like to know how to reject a girl without breaking her heart.

89
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,400
You're about to reject her yet you're still worried about her feelings.

90
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you like her or not?

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,800
It's not what you think.

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Then what's it?

93
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
I think that girl…

94
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
She probably just thought it would be fun and different.

95
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,980
That's why she's…

96
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,000
really into this game.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She's probably not serious. It's just on a whim.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,100
Most importantly… We're not compatible.

99
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,200
A game?

100
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,900
So what's considered "compatible"?

101
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,400
Cheers!

102
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Come on, come on.

103
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Keep going!

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 - Shake it. Come on. 
 - Go on. Go on. 

105
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,300
What am I supposed to do to get out of this game?

106
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,700
You've said so much…

107
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,100
But in fact, you're not thinking of it as a game.

108
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,600
Since you think she's treating it like a game,

109
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,000
why should you worry about her feelings?

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,700
When a man and a woman get trapped in a relationship for such a long time,

111
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,800
it's not possible for one party to be in love and the other not.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you don't like her, just reject her.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,800
This is the only way of not hurting her.

114
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Otherwise, you're being dishonest.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,300
What's going on?

116
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,220
Don't you have class tomorrow? Go home early.

117
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,559
- Okay. 
 - I'm going. Don't stay too late.

118
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,399
You lost again.

119
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,700
Drink, keep drinking!

120
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,300
 - Who's this? 
 - I don't know. 

121
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,100
 - What? 
 - Who's this guy? 

122
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,900
- I don't know him. 
 - I don't know him either.

123
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,100
Hello. I'm a friend of Shanshan's.

124
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,799
- Then drink together! 
 - Sit here.

125
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
- Thank you. 
 - Take a seat.

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Sit down.

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,900
 - Let's keep going. 
 - Come on. 

128
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,200
You lost again, Shanshan.

129
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
Lost again. Drink.

130
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,700
Yeah.

131
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,300
Shanshan is drunk today. I'll drink it for her.

132
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,100
A hero rescuing a damsel in distress?

133
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,600
You have to drink double if you're drinking for her.

134
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,800
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah, double.

135
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,600
Double the drinks.

136
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,800
No problem.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Come on, keep going.

138
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,700
Hurry.

139
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm leaving. This is boring.

140
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,800
Shanshan, that's a bummer.

141
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,200
Didn't you say you were in a bad mood and asked us all to come and keep you company?

142
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,900
It's my fault.

143
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,400
I'll drink this to apologize to you.

144
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:48,719
Guan Ji.

145
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,229
Guan Ji.

146
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,079
Room Service.

147
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,163
Ms. Bi, Mr. Guan has left for work.

148
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:11,484
He asked me to bring breakfast for you, in both Chinese and Western.

149
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:15,759
Mr. Guan also asked me to bring yogurt and mulberry juice to sober up.

150
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,960
And here are the clothes you can change into.

151
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,799
It's also from Mr. Guan.

152
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,920
If you need anything, feel free to let us know.

153
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,920
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

154
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,080
 You look good in black. 

155
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,159
 I like you in black. 

156
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,794
   

157
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:12,163
 I'm busy this morning. 

158
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:13,939
 Come see me when you wake up. 

159
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,819
You came here to learn about Zhanlan?

160
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:25,379
That's right. Zhanlan's CEO, Jiang Shaoyuan is a native of Ancheng.

161
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,416
He's also known as an entrepreneur who loves his hometown.

162
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,159
He's mentioned this many times in public:

163
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,140
Tourists flock to the Xiaguang Temple of Ancheng.

164
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,440
Ten years ago, Mr. Jiang returned here and founded Zhanlan.

165
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,167
Zhanlan developed well, boosting the local economy.

166
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:42,159
Mr. Jiang has always talked about his hometown's beautiful scenery.

167
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,159
He calls upon tourists to visit his hometown.

168
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,295
So, if you want to know Zhanlan, you have to know Jiang Shaoyuan first.

169
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,468
If you want to know him, you must visit the Xiaguang Temple he talks about.

170
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,979
What's wrong, Mr. Shi?

171
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,650
That was a lot of research last night.

172
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,900
How long have you been memorizing this?

173
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,659
We journalists have to speak with logic and facts.

174
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:07,520
It's natural to do our homework beforehand.

175
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,599
Look at the steps.

176
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:31,620
If you fall, we won't need to know Mr. Jiang and your homework will be in vain.

177
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,119
I don't know how.

178
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,050
♫  Intoxicated under the sunset  ♫

179
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,750
♫  The light fades through my fingertips  ♫

180
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:03,207
♫  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  ♫

181
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,549
♫  Let time no longer be boring  ♫

182
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,829
♫  The evening breeze blows gently  ♫

183
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,873
♫  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  ♫

184
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,986
♫  A sip of summer intoxication  ♫

185
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:17,499
♫  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  ♫

186
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:21,383
♫  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  ♫

187
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:25,279
♫  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  ♫

188
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,939
I'll send you the pictures in a minute.

189
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,619
Okay.

190
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,320
Miss and Mister.

191
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,860
You two are really too good-looking.

192
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,260
You're the most compatible couple I've seen today.

193
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,679
- We're not… 
 - Can I help you?

194
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,440
You don't know this? Today is the last day the temple is open to the public.

195
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,339
Starting tomorrow, the temple will be closed for half a year.

196
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,279
You two are here at the right time.

197
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,303
Why don't I take a picture of you two for you to take home as a souvenir?

198
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:01,919
No wonder there are so many people here today.

199
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,820
We're in luck.

200
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,580
Do you want to take a picture?

201
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,799
It's the first time I've been here and I don't know when the next time will be.

202
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,680
It's worthwhile to take a picture as a souvenir, isn't it?

203
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:16,219
Yeah, you're right.

204
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,939
Come here.

205
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,659
This is the best view.

206
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:26,780
Come.

207
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,300
Miss and Mister, let's be more natural.

208
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,519
Be intimate.

209
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,459
Miss, lean over to him.

210
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,519
Please come a little closer. Show me some sweetness.

211
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,986
Don't be so serious-looking, mister. Smile.

212
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,319
Mister, you have a nice smile.

213
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,240
Miss, give me a smile, too.

214
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,800
That's right. Look here.

215
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,480
One, two, three.

216
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,239
This one's good. How lovely.

217
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:18,420
What's the word for it…

218
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,659
"Like a loving couple."

219
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,720
Both of you look. Do you like it?

220
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,200
Thank you. That's a great shot.

221
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,119
As long as you're happy.

222
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,200
Two photos, 99 yuan.

223
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,980
Add me on WeChat, and transfer me the money. And I'll send you the picture.

224
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,319
It's so expensive.

225
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,160
Miss, that's a couple's discount.

226
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,659
What was the original price?

227
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,459
50 yuan a piece.

228
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,219
That's a bargain; 1% off.

229
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:47,519
99 is a lucky number.

230
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,720
It represents lasting love.

231
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,920
Okay, I'll touch-up the photo and send it to you.

232
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,879
Here's a complimentary tip for you:

233
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,640
You can draw a fortune stick there.

234
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,699
It's the perfect place for a couple to go.

235
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:06,139
Go there and ask for a fortune stick. I wish you two a lasting relationship.

236
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,600
You two have fun.

237
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,920
Miss and Mister.

238
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,079
You two are too good-looking.

239
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,680
You're the most compatible couple I've seen today.

240
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,959
So he's got the same lines for everyone. "Good-looking" and "compatible", huh…

241
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,519
   

242
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Are you really going to draw a stick?

243
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:14,020
Best fortune!

244
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,880
The match-making fairy is childish.

245
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,820
The right person is already deeply in love.

246
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,519
What does it mean?

247
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,659
I can interpret it for you. Come here.

248
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Sir, how should I interpret it?

249
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,159
You've drawn a lucky sign.

250
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,319
The most fortunate one.

251
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,279
But it shows that…

252
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,240
Your love has lost direction.

253
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,240
- Are you sure it's a good sign? 
 - Don't worry.

254
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,100
Though the direction was lost, to begin with, your true love has appeared.

255
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,799
Your Mr. Right has arrived.

256
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,799
Trust him wholeheartedly.

257
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,240
You two are a match made in heaven for life.

258
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,440
 So I'm already deeply in love without knowing. 

259
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,540
 The match-making fairy is indeed childish. 

260
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,219
Who'd thought Shi Yan was Qin Lezhi's uncle?

261
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:15,279
 But "deeply in love"… 

262
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,499
 Does it mean that he has been… 

263
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,820
Thank you.

264
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,580
Thank you for the nice interpretation, sir.

265
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,500
Take care, Miss.

266
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,290
   

267
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,739
Do you really believe that?

268
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,200
Why not?

269
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,379
Everyone wants to meet their right person.

270
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,440
Let's go. Read it more carefully when you get back.

271
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,041
   

272
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,780
Grandpa, look. Why is every stick in the tube a fortunate stick?

273
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,519
Also, the man who stood there for so long must have done something.

274
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,299
You're too young to understand.

275
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,340
It's a gift from the heavens.

276
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,060
One must earn this gift from the heavens.

277
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:14,360
Zheng Shuyi, watch the steps.

278
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,020
This will do the trick.

279
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,579
When are you going to Zhanlan?

280
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:28,079
I was supposed to go today but because you—

281
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,819
Because I what?

282
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,759
Because you're going tomorrow, so I moved the interview to the day after tomorrow.

283
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,920
I watched the news about Zhanlan yesterday and found that they gave an explanation.

284
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,480
They said their batteries didn't cause the accident but they gave no evidence.

285
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,799
It's a critical time for them to raise money.

286
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,659
My guess is they're trying to tone it down.

287
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:54,400
So I'm going to go to Zhanlan with you tomorrow to see if I can get anything out of it.

288
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
This way I can better prepare for my interview.

289
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,279
So I rescheduled.

290
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:05,560
That's why I can have this one-day trip to Ancheng with you.

291
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,500
So I'm the one who's taking advantage.

292
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:13,459
We still have time. Let's hurry to our next destination.

293
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,680
There's another one?

294
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,980
I did my homework, didn't I?

295
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,720
Two bowls of yellow fish noodles, one without green onion.

296
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,759
Got it.

297
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,580
You really love noodles.

298
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:46,039
 Shuyi, when are you coming back? 

299
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,179
 You're done with your story? 

300
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:55,500
 I'm in trouble and I need your help. 

301
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,379
 I'll help in a couple of days. 

302
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,340
 I can't go on like this. 

303
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,399
 In that case, you might as well strike while the iron is hot. 

304
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,060
 I'll send you some materials related to Zhanlan. 

305
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,139
 Gather and organize more information based on them. 

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,920
 Shuyi, you're cruel. 

307
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:23,100
 Don't worry. Leave it to me. I will definitely screw up. 

308
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,569
Hello. Two yellow-fish noodles.

309
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,499
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

310
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,100
 Uncle. Uncle. 

311
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,060
 I have lots of work. I'm tired. 

312
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,699
 Uncle, when are you coming back? 

313
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,419
 In a couple of days. 

314
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,060
 You too? 

315
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,440
 I've been working so long without eating. I'm so pathetic. 

316
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,340
 I don't care, Uncle. 

317
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,610
 Bring me souvenirs and snacks. 

318
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:10,439
 I need them to comfort my broken heart and weary soul. 

319
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,539
 Got it. 

320
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,819
It's bad for your stomach to be distracted while eating.

321
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:20,580
- It's my niece. 
 - What does she want with you?

322
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,300
Nothing. She wants a souvenir.

323
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,060
Rich people are fun.

324
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,799
They want everything, including other people's stuff.

325
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,019
They even want souvenirs from a small city.

326
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,239
How different.

327
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,639
 Shi Yan what do you really want? 

328
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:48,359
 Whatever you want, have you considered your father and your family? 

329
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,300
 Have you ever considered my feelings? 

330
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,939
 I told you what I wanted. 

331
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:54,340
 But you never understood me. 

332
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,300
 I really don't understand. 

333
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,000
 You've got so much already. 

334
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,740
 Why are you giving all that up? 

335
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,659
 Why do you want so much? Why do you want something so different? 

336
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:05,060
 Have you ever thought about what I want? 

337
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,379
 Am I in your life's plan or not? 

338
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,759
 Shi Yan, let's break up. 

339
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,019
Of course, you're different in a different way than others.

340
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,980
Zheng Shuyi,

341
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:41,139
do you also think I'm really unreasonable?

342
00:26:41,923 --> 00:26:44,340
No, not at all.

343
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,979
I think you have your own ideas and won't be easily influenced by others.

344
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:51,879
You also work very hard for your dreams.

345
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,340
There are so many people in this world.

346
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,759
It's no fun if you're just like everyone else.

347
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:59,519
And you've got exceptionally good taste.

348
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,940
Really. Especially since you chose me…

349
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,080
to do interviews and features on Cloud Innovation.

350
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,900
Yeah, I also think my taste's good.

351
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,539
Yu You, I'm having a hard time.

352
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,859
Do you know that?

353
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:49,540
Why don't you ask me if you don't know?

354
00:27:57,699 --> 00:27:59,740
 Chat with me and I'll give you 1 yuan. 

355
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,899
 Did you just get off work, too? 

356
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,500
 Yes. 

357
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,200
 Since we both worked late, why don't I invite you to dinner? 

358
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,519
 No, thanks. 

359
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,300
He didn't say he'd eaten, so he hasn't.

360
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,400
 Are you going to eat with your girlfriend? 

361
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,400
 If you don't like her, just reject her. 

362
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,279
 This is the only way of not hurting her. 

363
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,619
 Otherwise, you're being dishonest. 

364
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,319
 I don't have a girlfriend. 

365
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,500
Yu You doesn't like guys and doesn't have a girlfriend.

366
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:49,520
 I did nothing and shouldn't be rewarded. 

367
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,240
 You don't have to invite me for dinner. 

368
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,580
 You did nothing? 

369
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,900
 You talked to me and I owe you 1 yuan. 

370
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,710
 Just like the breeze on the river, you blew away the gloom that work brings me. 

371
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,462
 You're like a spring breeze that allows me to embrace the sun again. 

372
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:09,580
 For such great help, I should buy you dinner! 

373
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,780
 Actually, I should should buy you 10 dinners! 

374
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:14,550
You don't have to be so polite.

375
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,640
 If the stress of the job is really too much 

376
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,620
 there are a few things you can do to de-stress. 

377
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,240
Like extreme sports

378
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,479
Of course. Don't push yourself too hard.

379
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:26,799
If the stress is still too much, consider changing jobs.

380
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:31,759
Yu You, are you a monk or something?

381
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,920
You're completely immune to flirting.

382
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,060
Thank you for accompanying me all day today.

383
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,821
I'm going to my room. See you tomorrow.

384
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:56,459
 Say something. 

385
00:29:56,459 --> 00:30:00,260
 Shouldn't you say "no problem" when someone says "thank you"? 

386
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,419
You…

387
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,279
What is it?

388
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,780
Do you want…

389
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,120
Why are you calling me at this hour? You didn't go out?

390
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,900
I'm at home.

391
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,479
Forget about me. How are you with Shi Yan?

392
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,600
Nothing. We're all working.

393
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,599
Right now is your most active time.

394
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,979
I'm sure there's something off.

395
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:12,740
You're hiding from your suitor?

396
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,880
Since you're so good and perceptive,

397
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,480
I'll have to ask you how far you've gotten with Shi Yan.

398
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,919
Did you hold hands? Did you kiss?

399
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,739
What do you care? You mind your own business.

400
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:24,939
You can't keep hiding like this.

401
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,780
I'm hanging up.

402
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,780
 Your Mr. Right has arrived. 

403
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,319
 You two are a match made in heaven for life. 

404
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,219
 Do you know how long Uncle Tian nagged me in his office today? 

405
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:55,359
 He kept asking me if you could nail Zhanlan's case on this trip. 

406
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,200
 All I could do was keep pouring him tea. 

407
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm telling you.

408
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,039
You need to figure out what you're going to do.

409
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,100
If they know you're up to something else, they're going to do something.

410
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,840
 I got it. 

411
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,690
But why did you leave Chen Sheng in Jiangcheng

412
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,820
and left for Ancheng on your own?

413
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,800
You didn't go out tonight?

414
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,210
I… I'm in the middle of something.

415
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,000
I'll leave you to it.

416
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,900
 I'm going to bed. You go to bed early, too. 

417
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,780
 See you tomorrow. 

418
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,540
 Good night. 

419
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,020
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

420
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,000
   

421
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,581
We've been waiting for 20 minutes.

422
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:59,316
Did they say when they'd pick us up?

423
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,680
Mr. Shi, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

424
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,219
Mr. Jiang is particularly busy today. I'll show you two around first.

425
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,299
After the tour, I'll take you to see Mr. Jiang.

426
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,659
Thank you.

427
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,279
This way, please.

428
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,700
Mr. Jiang, Mr. Shi is here.

429
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,680
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

430
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,900
Hello.

431
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,099
And this is?

432
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:40,100
This is my special assistant.

433
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:47,559
Since you're in Ancheng, have you been to Xiaguang Temple?

434
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,039
It's very scenic. It's worth a visit.

435
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,839
We've visited it.

436
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,259
Take a seat.

437
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,139
 Looks like Shi Yan has hit a wall this time. 

438
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,399
You're so young and talented.

439
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,800
Zhanlan, in comparison, is old.

440
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,760
It was founded over a decade ago. We're more conservative.

441
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,050
I'm cautious in choosing partners.

442
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,800
I don't want to try anything too easily.

443
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:20,360
My company's young indeed.

444
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,159
That's why we like challenges. And we don't fear failure.

445
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,599
Cloud Innovation takes Zhanlan's partnership very seriously.

446
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,579
The investment isn't small for Cloud Innovation.

447
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:32,139
So we'll be very careful with Zhanlan.

448
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:35,320
That's why I visited you personally.

449
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,700
So, do you have any suggestions?

450
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,680
Do you know anything about the recent accident with Hengxin's new energy car in Jiangcheng?

451
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,239
No.

452
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,379
I've never heard of it.

453
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,580
It just so happens that my special assistant was in that car.

454
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,359
Why don't you ask her about what happened at that time?

455
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,440
The car I took that day was Hengxin's car.

456
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,960
At the time of the accident, the vehicle suddenly slowed down.

457
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,359
It stopped all of a sudden, causing a collision.

458
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,600
It seems like the driver's fully responsible for the accident.

459
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,440
Any product has uncertainties, especially a complex product like an automobile.

460
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,900
There are so many things that can cause accidents.

461
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,890
Investment firms are similar.

462
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,060
Are you sure that every project you invest in is risk-free?

463
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,780
Also, when the driver turned, he still had 30 percent of the battery.

464
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,660
It's just the driver's fault and has nothing to do with the battery.

465
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:56,280
As an investment company,

466
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,390
Cloud Innovation should focus on overall value and potential...

467
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,440
instead of holding on to a single incident.

468
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,119
If you insist on doing so.

469
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,379
Then Cloud Innovation and Zhanlan…

470
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:13,100
we may not collaborate so well.

471
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,440
Then I'd like to ask you something.

472
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,719
As an expert in batteries, do you think this case was caused by battery failure?

473
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:24,179
Eighteen such incidents have occurred recently.

474
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,270
Does Zhanlan have a solution to this? Or do you have a team specially working on it?

475
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,530
Does Zhanlan have a solution to this? Or do you have a team specially working on it?

476
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:30,579
Mr. Shi,

477
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,220

478
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:42,120
- If that's the case, why don't we just leave it at that for today? 
 - Sure.

479
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,319
Thanks for sharing the information.

480
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,539
A total of six companies passed our first round of screening.

481
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:53,740
In the end, we will choose three of them.

482
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:00,720
Since you can afford to lose, get back and find a new program.

483
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,839
But on the way, think carefully.

484
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,659
You have to come up with an excellent story to reassure your major shareholders.

485
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,179
It's easy to reassure them.

486
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:19,199
Mr. Shi investigated personally and confirmed the investment risk.

487
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,320
We'll choose a less risky program with a more sincere partner.

488
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,559
Shareholders will be very happy to hear that. We don't need to reassure them.

489
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,729
Or should I say that Zhanlan, though being a big company

490
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:31,601
when faced with a quality issue, doesn't try to solve it

491
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,779
but instead chooses to cover the problem up?

492
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,700
Before I came here, I thought very highly of you.

493
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,880
I thought you were great to stay in your hometown and start a business here.

494
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,840
You turned Zhanlan into a leading company in the industry.

495
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,740
I thought you had dreams and a sense of responsibility.

496
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,139
I just didn't realize...

497
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:47,420
the gap between reality and imagination is surprisingly large.

498
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,420
Let's go.

499
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,900
 What's he thinking? 

500
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,405
 Is he worried? 

501
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,660
 I was very harsh just now. 

502
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,620
 I guess Cloud Innovation can't collaborate with Zhanlan. 

503
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,679
 And then he mentioned the shareholders. 

504
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,460
 That must've made him anxious. 

505
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,019
 He must be pissed off right now. 

506
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,197
 Oh no. 

507
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:44,479
 He's not going to book a flight back, is he? 

508
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,500
Go to Annie's.

509
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,359
Yes, Mr. Shi.

510
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,100
Assistant Zheng, do you have any comments?

511
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,200
No, nothing. I thought…

512
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,860
You thought…

513
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,539
I thought you weren't hungry.

514
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,200
I'm hungry now.

515
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,760
Is it true what he just said?

516
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,480
Cloud Innovation's shareholders all want you to collaborate with Zhanlan. Right?

517
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,600
They don't know that you came to investigate?

518
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,920
So what do we now that I said something so harsh?

519
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,740
Didn't you just say the solution for me?

520
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:43,699
We'll go back and choose a less risky program with a mores sincere partner.

521
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:46,359
Is that really okay?

522
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,400
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

523
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,539
A few board members have different views from me about this investment.

524
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:03,579
This accident really alerted me.

525
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:05,860
That's why I came to investigate in person.

526
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
I can accept less-than-perfect products.

527
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,440
But I don't accept question-dodging partners.

528
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,199
If Zhanlan's battery is problematic and they have no solution,

529
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:16,800
then our investment risk will be too high.

530
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,419
So… you were right about everything.

531
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,799
What you just said at Zhanlan is exactly what I was going to tell the board members.

532
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,600
And…

533
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:38,130
your wording was accurate and compelling.

534
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,690
You set a good example for me.

535
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:47,364
Aren't you hungry?

536
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:49,580
Waiter, we're ordering.

537
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,840
Did you give Mr. Fan the wrong address?

538
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,860
He couldn't make it.

539
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,899
He couldn't make it?

540
00:42:17,899 --> 00:42:19,960
I'll take a cab.

541
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,040
I don't ride in other people's cars.

542
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,820
So we keep waiting?

543
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,800
You can walk.

544
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,574
Walk?

545
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,800
Really? It's a bit far.

546
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:52,040
