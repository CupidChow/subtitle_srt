 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,625
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,700
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,888
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,325
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,699
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,125
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,625
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,525
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,575
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:12,945
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,911
   

22
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:50,400
Shuyi, what are you doing?

23
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,059
 Prepare for it. You will get the job. 

24
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,460
Yue Xingzhou.

25
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,199
Please sit down.

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,699
Please introduce yourself.

27
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,960
Iâ€¦

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,159
My name is Yue Xingzhou.

29
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,440
 He is a man. He doesn't want to work hard. 

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,079
 But he wants to take shortcuts. He thought you wereâ€¦ 

31
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,759
 He thought what? 

32
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,860
 Maybe it's all a misunderstanding. 

33
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,700
 He thought you were Lezhi's uncle. So he dumped Ms. Zheng 

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,120
 and fell in love with Lezhi. 

35
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,819
What are your career plans?

36
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,639
After joining Cloud Innovation,

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,359
I will strive to realize my self-worth in my position.

38
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,299
 I miss you. 

39
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:05,799
 Are you going to continue Cloud Innovation's feature? 

40
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,080
 Of course. 

41
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,639
 I'm going to work this weekend. 

42
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,960
 Are you going to work this weekend? Do I have a chance to behave? 

43
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,470
   

44
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,360
I came.

45
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,360
Am I invisible?

46
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,059
Sit over there.

47
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,800
 He said he was going to work. 

48
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,759
 And he really came to work. 

49
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,140
Book two movie tickets.

50
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
 Do you want me to book the whole theater? 

51
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,519
No.

52
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,800
Book tickets for the nearest movie.

53
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,580
 Okay. I'll send the ticket information to your phone soon. 

54
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,900
Are we going to see the movie or not?

55
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,979
No rush. I want to look at you.

56
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,299
Why are you looking at me?

57
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,360
I wonder if this movie is worth two hours.

58
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,199
Brother Shi Yan, are you here to see the movie too?

59
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,859
Fiona.

60
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,039
Why haven't you come to me for so long?

61
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,899
The movie is about to start. Let's go.

62
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,500
 Baby, I know what you are thinking. 

63
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,960
 After I finish this, let's get married. 

64
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,120
- Okay. 
 - Would you like some popcorn?

65
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,980
No.

66
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,159
Brother Shi Yan, we want to order drinks. What would you like?

67
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:33,180
Nothing for us. Thanks.

68
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,700
Eat one.

69
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,840
No.

70
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,879
Eat one.

71
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,980
 I'm getting married. 

72
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,119
 Remember to come to my wedding. 

73
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,799
The heroine is ruthless.

74
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,219
She invited him to her wedding when he was at a critical stage in his career.

75
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,100
She is ruthless.

76
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,840
Yes.

77
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,259
She should have waited.

78
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,080
What?

79
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,379
She should invite him to her kid's birthday party.

80
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,159
I think a woman should be ruthless.

81
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,140
Hold this for me. I want to go to the bathroom.

82
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,060
I will wait for you downstairs.

83
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,680
Brother Shi Yan,

84
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,279
where is the young lady who came with you?

85
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,520
She went to the bathroom.

86
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,940
She's pretty.

87
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,840
She is really pretty.

88
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,160
Well, I made a dinner reservation. Do you want to come with me?

89
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,559
No, thanks.

90
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,859
She... is shy.

91
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,240
Right? I think so, too. This movie is misleading.

92
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,380
- Yes, it's boring. 
 - I will never see it again.

93
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,279
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

94
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,379
What a shy woman.

95
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,700
Honey.

96
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,480
I see her everywhere we go.

97
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,519
Please, you must introduce me to this lady this time.

98
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,660
She is Fiona. This is Zheng Shuyi. She is a journalist from Financial Introduce.

99
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,520
Nice to meet you, Ms. Zheng. I am Fiona.

100
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,360
Nice to meet you, Fiona.

101
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,139
I booked a restaurant. Let's go eat. You can talk later.

102
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,360
We have to go.

103
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,919
Bye-bye.

104
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,320
It's a nice day.

105
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,279
What do you want?

106
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,620
I don't want to take the car. Could you walk with me?

107
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,720
We watched a movie together. What's wrong with taking a walk together? You should complete your service.

108
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,739
Service?

109
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:44,100
Do you want me to serve you?

110
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,520
I didn't mean that.

111
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,359
Who wanted to behave? Was it me?

112
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,659
I suddenly need a ride.

113
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,679
 Did I just shock him? 

114
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,519
 But this is a public place. It's not appropriate to kiss. 

115
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,779
 We will teach children a bad lesson. 

116
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,880
 Sometimes the aggressiveness of men is really worrying. 

117
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,979
What do you want? Did you think I was going to kiss you?

118
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,899
Yes. Can I not?

119
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,580
I don't like kissing in public.

120
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,879
I should have gotten in the car.

121
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:58,888
â™«  Unyielding and stubborn mouth  â™«

122
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:03,638
â™«  No sooner or later, waiting for a hug-  â™«

123
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:13,259
â™«  Unknowingly, I have become familiar with your taste  â™«

124
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,075
â™«  Neither cold nor hot, relying on a constant warmth  â™«

125
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:23,150
â™«  Quietly, controlled the pace  â™«

126
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,240
 How about having dinner together tomorrow? 

127
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
 No. 

128
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,600
â™«  The distance is just right  â™«

129
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,640
 Shuyi, how have you been? 

130
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:40,690
â™«  Don't say it was just a coincidence because of the weather  â™«

131
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,359
Give my phone back!

132
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,950
â™«  Baby, don't make any noise, just hold my hands tightly  â™«

133
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,150
You don't think I like them, do you?

134
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,900
No, I don't.

135
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,800
â™«  Unknowingly, I was affected  â™«

136
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,000
I think men all over the world like you.

137
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,240
â™«  And you are also responsible for my cloudiness and sunshine  â™«

138
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,159
I don't.

139
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:18,075
â™«  I just want to say that you in my heart are like sunshine and air  â™«

140
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:22,700
â™«  Even if you're elusive, you're never far away  â™«

141
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,938
I can't help it if you think so.

142
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,779
 Why do I sound like a harlot? 

143
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,975
Why are you laughing?

144
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,720
Nothing.

145
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,730
We are just friends.

146
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,100
If you don't want others to know about it, don't do it.

147
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,220
You make it sound like we are dating.

148
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,960
I went to buy a suitcase. We ran into each other. So we had dinner together.

149
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,879
Why did you buy a suitcase?

150
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,119
I was devastated. I wanted to leave the heartbroken place

151
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:04,139
and start over in a new place.

152
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,779
How long will you stay there?

153
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:12,140
I said I wanted to start over in a new place. Are you listening to me?

154
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,425
â™«  And you are also responsible for my cloudiness and sunshine  â™«

155
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,719
You are boring.

156
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:20,159
I'm going to do an interview.

157
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,420
Since I'm going, I'll gather some information by the way.

158
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,840
I think I'll stay there for ten days.

159
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,399
When will you go?

160
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,840
I've contacted them. I can go there anytime.

161
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,839
Are you going alone?

162
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,120
Of course. Who would go with me?

163
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,239
Send me your hotel and flight details.

164
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:50,619
You care about me because you like me.

165
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,919
Yu You and I are just friends.

166
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,740
There's nothing between us.

167
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,500
Instead of thinking about my relationship with him, you should worry about Shiyue.

168
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,160
She loves him.

169
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,039
I didn't think about it. And I am not that idle.

170
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,160
Don't you worry about your niece?

171
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,620
Do you think she is stupid?

172
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,559
She is smart.

173
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,500
Mr. Shi, Mr. Chen wanted to cancel today's meeting.

174
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,620
Why?

175
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,720
He said there was something wrong.

176
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,780
He didn't tell me the details.

177
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,539
Get some coffee. We are going to Le'an.

178
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,160
Okay, Mr. Shi.

179
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:52,640
- Good job. 
 - Thanks.

180
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,300
- Good job. 
 - Thanks.

181
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,119
Mr. Shi, I think our meeting was canceled.

182
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,280
What are youâ€¦

183
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,220
You've been working hard. I bought you some coffee to cheer you up.

184
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,799
 Thanks, Mr. Shi. 

185
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,560
Cloud Innovation will not give up Le'an. Cheer up.

186
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,519
Thanks, Mr. Shi.

187
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,380
Le'an's morale is low.

188
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,160
I'm a bit out of my depth.

189
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,300
Chen Kang,

190
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,860
only a clear and resolute manager can stabilize the morale of a team.

191
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,440
As long as you are there, Le'an will get through this.

192
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,219
Butâ€¦ the lab is working according to Bruce's plan.

193
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:45,400
He can lead us in technology.

194
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,779
We won't be able to replace him anytime soon.

195
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:53,319
You used to be a technician. The team trusts you.

196
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,739
I can't make it.

197
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:58,000
In the past few years, I have focused on management.

198
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,140
I haven't been involved in R&amp;D in a long time.

199
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,960
But you are the life of Le'an. You can't run away.

200
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,360
Things work themselves out.

201
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,699
Whoever started the trouble should end it.

202
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,139
Mr. Shi,

203
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:20,440
if Le'an fails, will it get you in trouble?

204
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,000
Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

205
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,279
Cloud Innovation and Le'an are young. We may fail.

206
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,939
But we should never be afraid of failure.

207
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,100
I see.

208
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,080
Don't worry, Mr. Shi. I will lead Le'an to get back on our feet.

209
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,859
Hello.

210
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,279
I see.

211
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,480
Shuyi, I'll have a meeting the day after tomorrow. I can't see you off.

212
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,559
I will ask Fan to take you to the airport.

213
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,100
Are you angry?

214
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,000
Fairy.

215
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,500
Little Fairy, please don't be mad.

216
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,700
Where are you going? You lose patience so easily.

217
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm going to cook noodles for my fairy.

218
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,600
Did you talk to the chief editor? When does the plane depart?

219
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Tomorrow morning.

220
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,300
- Sister Shuyi, Sister Nan, I am back. 
 - You are back.

221
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,300
I've wanted to come back for a long time. I missed you.

222
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,600
I can't wait to get to work.

223
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,300
That doesn't sound like you.

224
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,500
You came back just in time. There's a job for you.

225
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
What job?

226
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,900
Come with me on a business trip.

227
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,600
Copy that.

228
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Please sit down.

229
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,200
Mr. Luo, nice to meet you. I am Zheng Shuyi from Financial Introduce.

230
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
This is Qin Shiyue, an intern journalist.

231
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,800
Nice to meet you.

232
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,400
Ms. Zheng, I've heard a great deal about you.

233
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,800
I am flattered. Mr. Luo, let's begin.

234
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,100
Mr. Luo, as a successful returnee,

235
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,500
can you give some advice to overseas students?

236
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,400
My advice is simple.

237
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,000
Look at the world and remain true to your original aspiration.

238
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,080
   

239
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,120
   

240
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,600
Okay. Look. Do you like it? Look.

241
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,400
I like this one.

242
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,000
Good.

243
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,500
Ms. Shuyi, it's a waste to take a picture and not send it.

244
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,300
To whom?

245
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
 Have you finished your work? 

246
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,400
It went unexpectedly well. The interviewee was talkative.

247
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,300
Since you have finished your work, why haven't you come back?

248
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,600
It's my first time in Qionghai. It's a beautiful city.

249
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,800
 Shiyue can take pictures for me. 

250
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 I'd like to take some days off to have some fun. 

251
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,500
Shuyi.

252
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,300
Shuyi doesn't know Jiangcheng Garden.

253
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,100
Little Yan of the Shi family looks at the spring garden.

254
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I miss you even more.

255
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,100
Yue Xingzhou, check this out.

256
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,200
A lot is going wrong with your job.

257
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,300
This time, the whole department is dealing with your blunders.

258
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,100
I don't know what to tell them.

259
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,200
- Brother Hong. 
 - You don't have to explain.

260
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,500
I don't want to give you a hard time.

261
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,200
Go to the personnel office and resign.

262
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,100
Brother Hong, Iâ€¦

263
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,300
 Hey, stop knocking. 

264
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,900
Xingzhou.

265
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,600
What's this?

266
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,700
Shuyi.

267
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,200
Shuyi.

268
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,100
Yue Xingzhou.

269
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,400
Who do you think I am?

270
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,900
You look at Zheng Shuyi's pictures in front of me.

271
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,600
It's none of your business.

272
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,900
Yue Xingzhou,

273
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,800
I am your girlfriend.

274
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Do you know how much I've done for you?

275
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,700
You wanted a new car.

276
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,400
I asked my parents to buy you one.

277
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
You wanted to join Cloud Innovation. I pulled some strings to make it happen.

278
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
You don't have a soul.

279
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,100
What's the use of it?

280
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,000
You are a liar.

281
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,100
You made me lose Shuyi.

282
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,700
I've lost my job now.

283
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,300
Are you blaming me?

284
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,000
This is the result of your actions.

285
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,700
I truly loved you.

286
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,300
Have you ever loved me or Zheng Shuyi?

287
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,000
You haven't. The only thing you love is money and your future.

288
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,600
You love whoever brings them to you.

289
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,900
You realized I couldn't give you what you wanted, so you thought of Zheng Shuyi.

290
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,100
Do you think you're a good person?

291
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,600
You're leaving? Zheng Shuyi won't talk to you.

292
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,700
She is with Shi Yan. She won't even look at you, let alone come back to you.

293
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,400
No one likes you but me.

294
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,500
Mr. Shi.

295
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,300
Mr. Shi, I want to talk to you.

296
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,700
My boyfâ€¦

297
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,800
My ex-boyfriend still likes Zheng Shuyi.

298
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,000
- Do you know that? 
 - So what if I know?

299
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,100
What if I don't?

300
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,700
You don't know me well.

301
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,800
I have a bad temper. I am very egoistic.

302
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,400
If you keep bothering me,

303
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,900
I will get everything even for Zheng Shuyi.

304
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,700
Do you understand?

305
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,400
Mr. Shi is busy. He sent me to pick you up.

306
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,500
I am good, Mr. Fan.

307
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,900
How will you get back?

308
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,500
The secret can't be revealed.

309
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,100
Shiyue!

310
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,800
Yu You!

311
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
Another round.

312
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
You're finally back.

313
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,700
I missed you.

314
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Let's go home.

315
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,300
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

316
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,700
It's my pleasure. I'll leave if it's okay.

317
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,200
Bye-bye.

318
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,700
Thank you, guys.

319
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,300
Mr. Shi,

320
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,800
I don't know if Le'an can get through this.

321
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,400
But you are the savior of Le'an and a friend of mine.

322
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,100
I will never forget it.

323
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,800
When something goes wrong, we fix it. I believe in Le'an and you.

324
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,400
To all of you.

325
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,200
 - Thank you, Mr. Shi. 
 - We will work hard together. 

326
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,400
 Ms. Zheng got home safely. 

327
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,200
 But I saw her ex-boyfriend sneaking around her doorstep. 

328
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,000
Guys, excuse me.

329
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
 Why did Mr. Shi leave? 

330
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,600
Shuyi.

331
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,400
What do you want? Let me tell you, Yue Xingzhou.

332
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,800
You are breaking into my house. I will call the police.

333
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,200
Shuyi, I am sorry. I know I'm sorry to you.

334
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,000
Go somewhere else to repent. This isn't a recycling station.

335
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Let go!

336
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
Shuyi,

337
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,200
do you have no feelings for me at all?

338
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:02,100
â™«  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  â™«

339
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:09,200
â™«  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  â™«

340
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,200
â™«  Only you caught me off guard  â™«

341
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,400
â€‹â™«  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  â™«

342
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
â™«  A face that gets clearer  â™«

343
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,600
What are you looking at?

344
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,970
I am looking atâ€¦

345
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,800
my kiss that enamored you and made your hair messy.

346
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,500
â™«  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  â™«

347
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,600
â™«  Luckily, you didn't go far away  â™«

348
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,700
â™«  I can still tightly hold your hand  â™«

349
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,600
Wait for me.

350
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,200
Are you leaving?

351
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,300
You don't want me to leave?

352
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,800
No. You may leave. I'm going to bed.

353
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,000
Don't go to bed. Wait for me.

354
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,600
â™«  No matter how windy, snowy, and cold it is, I will give you warmth  â™«

355
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,500
Don't open the door to strangers. You hear me?

356
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,700
Yes. Just leave.

357
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,000
Don't meet her again. Okay?

358
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,700
- Weâ€¦ 
 - You are done.

359
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,900
If you have any thoughts about her, you'd better stop.

360
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,400
If I see you pestering her again,

361
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,800
I can't guarantee what I'll do.

362
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,600
Go away. Don't make me do it.

363
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,700
He's back so soon.

364
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,500
Excuse me. I had an accident on the way here.

365
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,400
Could you not complain about me?

366
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,200
It's all right.

367
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Thank you. I'll send you a red envelope.

368
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,300
You want to send me a red envelope when I am late?

369
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,200
Is she crazy?

370
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,200
- Enjoy yourself. Thanks. 
 - Thanks.

371
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,000
Hello, what's up?

372
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,600
Are you with Shi Yan?

373
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,800
I didn't know you would abandon friends for your boyfriend.

374
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,600
He just left.

375
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,400
I didn't meet the right person before.

376
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Enough. I don't want to hear it.

377
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,200
Every dog has his day.

378
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,100
Hey, who are you talking about?

379
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,400
 You know who I'm talking about. 

380
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,700
Didn't you just come back from Qionghai tonight? What did you do just now?

381
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,500
Just now?

382
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,600
 Tell me. 

383
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,900
No way, Zheng Shuyi.

384
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,800
Good for you.

385
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,500
What are you talking about?

386
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,300
We onlyâ€¦

387
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,900
kissed. You know?

388
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,300
 Kiss. 

389
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,600
Okay.

390
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Nothing else?

391
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,900
He is busy. He took the time to come to me.

392
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,900
If I knew he would forgive you so easily,

393
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,800
 I wouldn't have been worried. 

394
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,200
 Don't go to bed. Wait for me. 

395
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,100
Where do you want to go?

396
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,000
I want to go into your heart.

397
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,100
What's wrong?

398
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,300
What are we? Why did you come into my house?

399
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,200
I'm your landlord.

400
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,000
 Is this community also his property? 

401
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,300
Don't you want to come into my heart?

402
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,800
How much did you drink?

403
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,000
Not so much.

404
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,900
You are making yourself too comfortable.

405
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,600
Are you drunk?

406
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,700
Kind of.

407
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,200
I heard that people who wear glasses

408
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,400
don't like people touching their glasses.

409
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,800
If their glasses are removed, they will feel insecure.

410
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,500
I want to check if you can see clearly when you take off your glasses.

411
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,500
As long as I can see you clearly.

412
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,500
 What's going on with this drunk man? 

413
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,100
 How did he change? 

414
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,500
When you wake up tomorrow, will you remember what happened today?

415
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,400
What happened today?

416
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,600
Call me baby.

417
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Call me baby.

418
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,500
Baby.

419
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,800
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

420
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,300
Will you remember what you said tomorrow?

421
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,500
Will you become the cold person you used to be?

422
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:19,600
â™«  I'm just a little more possessive  â™«

423
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,500
Don't you like my cold look?

424
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,900
I don't care.

425
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,200
If you don't admit it tomorrow, I'll write an article to expose you.

426
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:35,778
â™«  Why don't you just let me ride the wind?  â™«

427
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's leave proof.

428
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,800
â™«  I will also be cautious, I will also be breathless  â™«

429
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Youâ€¦

430
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,600
â™«  I will also indulge with gentle palms  â™«

431
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,100
â™«  Stop being careless and pretending not to care  â™«

432
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,900
â™«  I hear your heart whispering  â™«

433
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,140
This is the proof.

434
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,800
Keep it.

435
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,400
Hold me a little longer.

436
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,500
â™«  I can't grasp it, so I take a deep breath  â™«

437
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,100
â™«  Let flowing breaths fill my memory  â™«

438
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,400
â™«  We met, we fell in love  â™«

439
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,800
â™«  No need to ask, I am willing  â™«

440
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Do you feel sick?

441
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,100
I'll make you a drink to sober you up.

442
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,200
â™«  I just want to get close to you  â™«

443
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,900
â™«  I just simply like you  â™«
