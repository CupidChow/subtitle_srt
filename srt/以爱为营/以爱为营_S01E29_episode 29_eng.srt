 "Lemon Soda" - Lai Meiyun 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:32,280
♫  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  ♫

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,505
♫  Dreams in winter are too fragile  ♫

5
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:38,680
♫  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  ♫

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,280
♫  Intoxicated under the sunset  ♫

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,805
♫  The light fades through my fingertips  ♫

8
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,205
♫  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  ♫

9
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:50,691
♫  Let time no longer be boring  ♫

10
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:54,030
♫  The evening breeze blows gently  ♫

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,105
♫  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  ♫

12
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,280
♫  A sip of summer intoxication  ♫

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,605
♫  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  ♫

14
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,505
♫  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  ♫

15
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,555
♫  Stop frowning  ♫

16
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:13,025
♫  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  ♫

17
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:16,380
♫  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  ♫

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,080
♫  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  ♫

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,355
♫  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  ♫

20
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:36,005
   

21
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,991
   

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,480
Suppose a girl always proactively pursued a man.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,419
Then they…

24
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,219
Then they had some problems.

25
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,120
And then the girl completely stopped contacting that man.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,520
What could be the reason?

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,719
What reason could there be?

28
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,079
Being proactive all the time can be tiring.

29
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,940
In a relationship, a man should also take the initiative sometimes.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,200
In a relationship, a man should also take the initiative sometimes.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,259
Isn't this the time for the man to be proactive?

32
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,400
For the man to… be proactive?

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
Yep.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,240
It was always the girl who took the initiative.

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,319
Now can't the man also take some initiative?

36
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,140
Since he's been non-responsive who knows what he is really thinking.

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,639
Or whether he even cares for the girl at all.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,539
Maybe not contacting me means there is no more love.

39
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:39,879
She could apologize for the sake of work but not for me.

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,740
Uncle,

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,539
between you and Shuyi…

42
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,700
What's going on with you two?

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,739
Do you really plan to stop talking to her for good?

44
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,439
The way men and women think is completely different.

45
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,840
Between you two, there might be misunderstandings.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,779
Between you two, there might be misunderstandings.

47
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:12,900
Sometimes it's because girls care so much that they dare not express their true feelings.

48
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:22,800
 Tomorrow you should go to the hospital for the rabies vaccine. 

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,095
 I don't have class tomorrow afternoon. 

50
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:27,599
 If you need, I can accompany you. 

51
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,080
She was proactive but didn't explain herself...

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,560
She was proactive but didn't explain herself...

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,719
What does that really mean?

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,599
Uncle, what do you think is most important in a relationship?

55
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,740
Uncle, what do you think is most important in a relationship?

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,019
How can a relationship last till the end?

57
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:54,420
Honesty.

58
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,900
Honesty is fundamental.

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,879
Treat each other sincerely.

60
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,240
If you want to reach the end, co-compatibility is the most important thing.

61
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,700
If two people can't stay on the same frequency even if their relationship lasts to the end, they will part ways.

62
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,020
Didn't you just say that in a relationship, it can't be just one side taking initiative?

63
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,639
So,

64
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:20,260
love can't be maintained only through one person's unconditional compromise.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,260
Before pursuing love, you should be clear about your life goals first.

66
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,659
Before pursuing love, you should be clear about your life goals first.

67
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:29,360
Then you'll know with whom you want to spend your life.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Uncle,

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,160
is Shuyi your Miss Right?

70
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,920
You should turn in.

71
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,579
On the same frequency?

72
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,360
But how to stay on the same frequency?

73
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,979
What are my life goals?

74
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:25,042
 You haven't been coming to class recently. 

75
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:29,120
 I've sent the class materials and recorded lectures to the cloud. 

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,639
 You can take a look when you're free. 

77
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,920
 If you've got any questions, you can always ask me. 

78
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,839
 If you have time, you can continue to attend classes. 

79
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,519
 If two people can't stay on the same frequency, 

80
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,900
 even if the relationship lasts to the end, they will part ways. 

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,879
 Thank you, Professor Yu. 

82
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,862
 I will carefully go over the content you sent. 

83
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:13,034
 I can go for the vaccination myself, 

84
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:15,639
 there's no need for me to trouble you. 

85
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,930
   

86
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,879
Sister Yuling,

87
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,319
you got so much material!

88
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,600
Your article must be a hit.

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,199
Maybe I'm just lucky.

90
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,580
Mr. Shi cooperated in helping me.

91
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:07,807
 Zheng Shuyi, 

92
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,135
 are you free this afternoon? 

93
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:12,160
 I'd like to introduce a few friends who just returned home. 

94
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,625
   

95
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,680
 This is well written. 

96
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,979
 It's truly a heart-warming interview. 

97
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,128
 Everyone’s answers here are also the same ones I had. 

98
00:07:58,128 --> 00:08:01,958
   

99
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:09,355
   

100
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,240
I only participated a little in this project.

101
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,839
If one day I can write an article piece as good as Shuyi's on my own

102
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,619
that would be great.

103
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,779
I know what my life goal is.

104
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,290
Just now we talked about England and France.

105
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,440
Now let's look at Germany together.

106
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,459
Germany actually started industrializing relatively late.

107
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,611
In the 19th century, joint-stock companies were relatively few.

108
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:52,200
- Thank you. 
 - And the capital market was mainly serving the royal family, government…

109
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,020
- Thank you. 
 - And the capital market was mainly serving the royal family, government…

110
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,840
Long time no see.

111
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,959
And city-states…

112
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,200
Thanks to you for saving a seat for me today.

113
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,699
Or else I might have had to sit on the steps.

114
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,579
Actually, I haven't seen you come to class for a long time.

115
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,500
But I've been keeping this seat for you.

116
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,080
I didn't expect you to come today. What a coincidence.

117
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,959
Thank you.

118
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
I had some issues at home recently, so I didn't come.

119
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,472
But I will come often from now on.

120
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:26,419
Then I'll keep saving your seat.

121
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,819
Then I'll buy you coffee.

122
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,539
Sure.

123
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,720
We just talked about financial liberalization.

124
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,480
Actually, financial liberalization is also known as financial deepening.

125
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,200
It's a symmetry of financial repression.

126
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,120
Thank you.

127
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,499
…Enhance domestic financing capabilities to reduce over-reliance on foreign capital…

128
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:53,120
…reduce foreign dependence…

129
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,002
Thus promoting an increase in domestic savings rates,

130
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:07,100
achieving inflation control, and thereby stimulating economic growth.

131
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:17,939
I'll rely on you from now on. Thank you so much.

132
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,968
Do you have any questions about the class?

133
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,164
Professor Yu, I have another class.

134
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,515
Professor Yu, I have another class.

135
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,360
I have to go.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,859
I've got questions.

137
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,279
Here. Here.

138
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,159
Here. Here.

139
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,459
And here.

140
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,759
I marked them all.

141
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,540
I was waiting to ask you after class.

142
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,320
These were all explained in detail in class.

143
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,500
You probably missed them when you were absent.

144
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,600
How about this?

145
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,480
Didn't I give you some materials?

146
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,460
Read them and come to me if you still have any confusion.

147
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,560
Got it. Thank you, Professor Yu.

148
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,200
It's getting late.

149
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I don't have class later,

150
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,700
shall we go to the cafeteria?

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,700
Sure.

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,600
Professor Yu.

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
Professor Yu.

154
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,100
The student union wants to invite you to give a graduation speech to the soon-to-be graduates.

155
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
This could encourage and enlighten them.

156
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,300
Do you have time?

157
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,900
I'd like to go over the schedule and speech ideas with you.

158
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,700
You guys talk first. I'll go first.

159
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,600
Are you also Professor Yu's student?

160
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,800
I'm not.

161
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,600
So, are you Professor Yu's wife?

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Uh…

163
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,300
Chen Lei, later,

164
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,200
we'll discuss the details in the afternoon.

165
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,400
Okay, I'll go first.

166
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,300
Goodbye, Professor Yu.

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,300
She just misunderstood us.

168
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,600
Why didn't you explain clearly?

169
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,000
Explain what?

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
Explain that I'm not your…

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
You know…

172
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
What if she gossips?

173
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
She was joking.

174
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,200
And I think there's no need to explain.

175
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
What do you mean?

176
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,000
Speaking of which my flat's door is fixed.

177
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll see when I have time.

178
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,700
Le'an Tech's team has professional equipment and a research environment.

179
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,300
The precision of your research far exceeded my expectations.

180
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,400
So, Professor Li…

181
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Now that you've seen our labs, do you have any suggestions?

182
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,100
Also, is it possible for us to cooperate with your lab?

183
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
My lab is attached to the university.

184
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
The team members are mainly students.

185
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,400
Currently, we mainly focus on cutting-edge academic research.

186
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,300
Honestly, it's beyond our capabilities to help Le'an solve problems in the short term.

187
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
I have a suggestion, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate to say.

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Please speak, Professor Li.

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,100
If Le'an Tech cooperates with Dark Horse, then all your problems will be easily solved.

190
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,000
How is that possible?

191
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
 Zheng Shuyi, I want to invite you to join me at EM's charity dinner. 

192
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,600
 Zheng Shuyi, I want to invite you to join me at EM's charity dinner. 

193
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,400
I heard the shareholders might replace Shi Yan.

194
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,100
Is it that serious?

195
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,600
Then Shi Yan must be worried.

196
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,900
He's not worried at all.

197
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,100
He's still attending EM's charity dinner as usual.

198
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,100
 Shuyi, 

199
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,800
 many people will come to the dinner. 

200
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,700
 It's good for networking. 

201
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,200
 Just consider it a favor. I'm socially anxious and could use some help. 

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
 Okay. 

203
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,800
 But I might leave early. 

204
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,200
 No problem, I don't want to stay there for long either. 

205
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,200
Did you wait long?

206
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
I just arrived.

207
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Let's go in.

208
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,508
   

209
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,100
Who are you messaging?

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No one. Come.

211
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,500
Yi Yang?

212
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,900
Why is he with Ms. Zheng?

213
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,800
♫  You obviously want to get closer  ♫

214
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,800
♫  But your eyes are avoiding me  ♫

215
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:09,600
♫  A sincere heart is defined because of you  ♫

216
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
♫  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  ♫

217
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
♫  The recurring dream has disturbed my breathing  ♫

218
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:28,300
♫  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  ♫

219
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,200
♫  The words that haven’t been spoken yet  ♫

220
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Shi Yan.

221
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,900
♫  But I'm afraid it's too late  ♫

222
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,300
♫  I predicted the rain, but I pretend not to care  ♫

223
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,800
Isn't Bei Lin Shi Yan's ex-girlfriend?

224
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,300
Have they remained friends after breaking up?

225
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,800
Or are they back together?

226
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Cloud Innovation is in turmoil.

227
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,600
Yet Shi Yan still shows up at this dinner.

228
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
There must be a reason.

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
♫  The courage to transcend time  ♫

230
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,100
Shi Yan, it's been a while.

231
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,800
It's been a while.

232
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,600
Isn't that the pretty journalist who used to be with Shi Yan?

233
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
How did she get together with Yi Yang?

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,700
His current girlfriend is meeting his ex.

235
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,400
♫  I'll let you know that I haven't forgotten  ♫

236
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Shuyi, are you hungry?

237
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Let's have some snacks.

238
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,200
Do you know them?

239
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,600
Not to your taste?

240
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,300
Come with me.

241
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,100
I kind of understand what you wanted to do back then.

242
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,500
You're drinking too fast.

243
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,000
Didn't you say…

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,600
that it was a loss during dinner if you don't enjoy delicious food and wine.

245
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,300
You're right.

246
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
I'll drink with you.

247
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Shuyi, honestly,

248
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Shuyi, honestly,

249
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,700
what do you think of me?

250
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,300
Do you doubt… that I can be a…

251
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,200
very good boyfriend?

252
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000
I do.

253
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,600
- So… 
 - Whether you're good or not, has nothing to do with me.

254
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm already into someone.

255
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
I like him.

256
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
I only have eyes for him.

257
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
My heart's filled with him.

258
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,100
I regret it.

259
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,100
Can we give each other another chance?

260
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,600
Not anymore.

261
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,800
When feelings are missed, they are missed.

262
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,200
Are you taking revenge on me?

263
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,500
I wouldn't use feelings for revenge or sacrifice feelings.

264
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
Sorry.

265
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
I didn't mean that.

266
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
But… you don't have a girlfriend yet, right?

267
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,000
But… you don't have a girlfriend yet, right?

268
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
I already have someone in my heart.

269
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,500
But you two broke up.

270
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,100
I never said I was going to break up with her.

271
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,700
Why don't you be with him since you like him so much?

272
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,100
It's my issue.

273
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Is she the girl you were looking at?

274
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,600
You mind her being with someone else?

275
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,400
After she left, you were restless.

276
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,500
Shi Yan, you've really changed.

277
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,800
Bei Lin, thank you for saying this to me today.

278
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
But I think we should both move forward.

279
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,700
Now, I'm leaving.

280
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,500
I don't want to see him.

281
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,100
I want to climb higher to see more scenery.

282
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,900
Zheng Shuyi!

283
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,800
Shi Yan.

284
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,900
Zheng Shuyi, come down.

285
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,300
Don't keep appearing in front of me.

286
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
I don't want to see you.

287
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
Shuyi, be careful.

288
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
Ignore him.

289
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
Zheng Shuyi, come down quickly.

290
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,900
I'm not coming down.

291
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,400
You want me to come down and I will?

292
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
You're mean to me. And you ignore me.

293
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
I don't need you.

294
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,900
Shuyi, listen. Come down.

295
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,700
I won't. Not unless you say something nice.

296
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
My fair lady,

297
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,900
come down nice and steady.

298
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Will you come to me?

299
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,600
Zheng Shuyi!

300
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
My fair lady.

301
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,665
Shi Yan.

302
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:30,500
You are a hmmm-monster weirdo, block maniac.

303
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,900
I hate you.

304
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,000
I hate you for ignoring me.

305
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,400
I hate your heart of stone.

306
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,800
I'll bite you to death.

307
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
Shi Yan,

308
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,500
let her go.

309
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,200
You're taking advantage of her.

310
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,000
If you can't give her what she wants, stay away from her.

311
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,400
Whatever Zheng Shuyi wants, I will give her everything I have.

312
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,800
As for things I don't have, I'll find a way to get for her.

313
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,400
But whatever she wants, she'll only want to get it from me.

314
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,600
♫  A face that gets clearer  ♫

315
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,200
♫  It's your shining eyes  ♫

316
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,400
♫  That lights up my universe  ♫

317
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,000
♫  I was disappointed, seized by uncertainties  ♫

318
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
♫  Luckily, you didn't go far away  ♫

319
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,900
♫  I can still tightly hold your hand  ♫

320
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,300
♫  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  ♫

321
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,500
Don't leave.

322
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,100
♫  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  ♫

323
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,000
Shi Yan.

324
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,800
I won't let you go.

325
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,700
I miss you so much.

326
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:22,400
​♫  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  ♫

327
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,500
Shi Yan.

328
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Shi Yan.

329
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
Shi Yan.

330
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,700
I'm here.

331
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
You're not.

332
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,000
They all can meet you.

333
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,800
But I can't.

334
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
I want to see you, too.

335
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,200
♫  Luckily, you didn't go far away  ♫

336
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,700
♫  I can still tightly hold your hand  ♫

337
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,600
Then answer one question for me.

338
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,500
♫  Meeting you was the driving force of fate  ♫

339
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,100
Zheng Shuyi,

340
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,186
do you really...

341
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,900
♫  And falling in love with you was my premeditated obedience  ♫

342
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,200
...have true feelings for me?

343
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,000
♫  Only you caught me off guard  ♫

344
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,800
​♫  I have pried off the shackles, but I am reluctant to escape  ♫

345
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:43,600
♫  I want to do everything for you  ♫

346
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,800
♫  I want to say I'm loving you every morning  ♫

347
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,800
♫  You can only fall into my arms  ♫

348
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:03,900
♫  No matter how windy, snowy, and cold it is, I will give you warmth  ♫

349
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:13,100
​♫  I will give you warmth  ♫

350
00:26:50,746 --> 00:26:53,516
   

351
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,700
 Good morning. Are you sober now? 

352
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,400
 What happened last night? 

353
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,300
 Who brought me home? 

354
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I'm awake. Thanks for the concern. 

355
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,600
Zheng Shuyi.

356
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,500
Stop daydreaming.

357
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,000
How could it be Shi Yan?

358
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:13,210
   

359
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,400
 Shuyi, 

360
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,800
 could you recommend any books on journalism? 

361
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,200
 I want to use the holiday to learn more. 

362
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,400
 Good for you, Shiyue. 

363
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,700
 You're taking the initiative to learn. That's great progress. 

364
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,400
 I'll make a list for you later. 

365
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,200
Fruit time.

366
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,100
This is from Mr. Yi of Dark Horse.

367
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,400
This bag is just for you.

368
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
Mr. Yi?

369
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,600
- You two…? 
 - No, we're not.

370
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
- You two…? 
 - No, we're not.

371
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Don't talk nonsense.

372
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,600
Thank you, Youran.

373
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
Could you please distribute these to everyone?

374
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Sure. Thank you, Sister Shuyi.

375
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,200
 Mr.Yi is making another move to pursue Shuyi. 

376
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,300
I never realized before that she was so good at this.

377
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Sister Shuyi, you have a delivery.

378
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,900
Thanks. Could you bring it here for me?

379
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,300
Thanks. Could you bring it here for me?

380
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,200
Uh… Shuyi, it's too big. I can't carry it.

381
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,800
 I hope to skateboard with you. 

382
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,800
 There's no need. 

383
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,000
 I will return your skateboard. 

384
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,500
 What's wrong? You don't like it? 

385
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,300
 Then what can I do to make you happy? 

386
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,700
 Can you tell me what happened at the dinner that day? 

387
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,600
 If you want to know, come find me at the city square after work the day after tomorrow. 

388
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,300
 Bring the skateboard. 

389
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,900
 I don't want to know now. 

390
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
 As you wish. 

391
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,800
 Anyway, I'll be there waiting for you. 

392
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,800
Shuyi, come here a moment.

393
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,600
Anything else?

394
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
Yes.

395
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Go on.

396
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
I heard Mr. Yi recently has been pursuing Ms. Zheng.

397
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,700
I heard he sent gifts to Financial Introduce for Ms. Zheng today.

398
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Leave.

399
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,100
Okay.

400
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Sister Yuling, Chief Editor wants to see you.

401
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
Chief Editor.

402
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,000
Yuling, you've been to Cloud Innovation so many times for interviews.

403
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,600
Every time you said you got a lot of useful material.

404
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,000
But why is this feature article so empty and superficial?

405
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,500
What about opinions? What's your point of view?

406
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,200
Go back and rewrite it.

407
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,600
If you submit another article of this quality, I'll find give the job to someone else.

408
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,100
Got it.

409
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,400
What did Chief Editor say to you?

410
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
Nothing.

411
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,400
We just talked about the overseas returnees entrepreneurship project.

412
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,600
Then what do you think Chief Editor and Xu Yuling are discussing right now?

413
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't know and don't care.

414
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,000
Just say it if you don't want to give up the Cloud Innovation feature.

415
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Why play dirty trick?

416
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
What do you mean?

417
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,900
First, it's Shi Yan. Then, Yi Yang.

418
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,700
No wonder things went so smoothly with your article.

419
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,600
You have both the Cloud Innovation feature and the overseas returnees feature in your hands.

420
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
You're way above a journalist.

421
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,300
Xu Yuling, stop spouting nonsense.

422
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,800
Shuyi has a unique perspective and sharp writing.

423
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,000
Every article she writes is a hit.

424
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,800
Does she need to smear you behind your back?

425
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Was it like this once or twice?

426
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,700
Was it like this once or twice?

427
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,800
She does have a unique perspective.

428
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,600
You only have interviewees in your eyes. Right?

429
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,000
Xu Yuling,

430
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,600
I won't admit to things I haven't done.

431
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,400
I'm busy and have many articles to write. I don't have time for this.

432
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,800
Do you think our well-seasoned chief can't see how you made up stuff in your articles?

433
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
It's no use shouting fiercely like this.

434
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,700
I hope your next feature won't be snatched away.

435
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
Don't listen to her nonsense.

436
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
She hasn't interviewed Shi Yan at all.

437
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,600
Come.

438
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Eat more meat.

439
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Okay, okay, enough.

440
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I have to watch my figure for the camera?

441
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,600
Don't worry about eating too much.

442
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
After eating, we can work out together this evening.

443
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,000
Then let's go home together.

444
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,800
So this is your plan.

445
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,500
Working out is fine.

446
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,000
But tonight you should go to your own home.

447
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,700
Shanshan…

448
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
Distance makes the hearts grow fonder.

449
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,000
 Shanshan 

450
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,300
 are you free tonight? 

451
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,200
Tonight?

452
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,800
I'm free tonight.

453
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,200
Let's have crayfish together?

454
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
Shanshan.

455
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Are you really free today?

456
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,600
I heard that little Dark Horse has been pursuing you lately?

457
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
Is it true?

458
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,900
How do you know, too?

459
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,800
How can I not know when he even sent gifts straight to Financial Introduce?

460
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,300
Bad news travels fast.

461
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,600
How can you call it bad news?

462
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,000
How is he?

463
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,300
Do you like him?

464
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,900
I just broke up with Shi Yan.

465
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,200
As you said, you two broke up.

466
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
He hasn't come looking for you. Right?

467
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,200
You must learn to let go and move on.

468
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,200
The way I see it, Yi Yang is pretty good.

469
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,800
He's young, passionate, and proactive.

470
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,500
With him, you'd feel more secure.

471
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,600
Shi Yan is not the only tree you can lean on.

472
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
Tree?

473
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,200
What's wrong?

474
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,300
I drank too much that night at the dinner.

475
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,800
I don't remember who brought me home.

476
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,200
Do you think it was Shi Yan who brought you home?

477
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Maybe it's just my illusion.

478
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,000
Because he should have been with Bei Lin.

479
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,000
But I seem to have smelled his scent.

480
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,400
So what if it was him?

481
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Did he come looking for you afterward?

482
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,800
You have a good option right in front of you.

483
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
You should seriously consider it.

484
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,200
Yi Yang is young and promising.

485
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
He's as good as Shi Yan. Right?

486
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,800
Love isn't a multiple choice question.

487
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I really don't feel that way about Yi Yang.

488
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,400
All right, you're not into him. Then forget it.

489
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,800
Since you're unlucky in love focus on your career.

490
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,000
Aren't you upgrading your e-magazine?

491
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,400
I won't let it affect my work.

492
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,200
Is that an urgent call?

493
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,100
Why don't you take it?

494
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,600
What's wrong?

495
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,300
 Why didn't you reply to my message? 

496
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,800
Didn't I reply?

497
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,300
 Replying with an emoji doesn't count. 

498
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,600
Just wait a moment for me.

499
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,000
 Miss you. 

500
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,600
   

501
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,000
Where should we go next?

502
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,600
I've seen many people recommend this place.

503
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Let's check it out.

504
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,000
That's enough.

505
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,800
That's about enough for you.

506
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,100
If you want to drink, we can do it another time.

507
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,900
You're in a hurry to leave?

508
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,200
Brother,

509
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,100
see how late it is now?

510
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,800
Isn't the bar your second home?

511
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,600
I also have my first, third, and fourth homes to take care of.

512
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,400
I…

513
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm in a relationship. kay?

514
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,000
Seriously,

515
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,200
I've been through whatever you're experiencing now.

516
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,200
I've struggled and suffered like you.

517
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,000
But people can't deceive their own hearts.

518
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,500
So I chose to take that first step.

519
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,600
So you see? Every day I'm feeling like the happiest person in the world.

520
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,800
Listen to me.

521
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,000
Go to her and talk to her.

522
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,700
Get an answer from her.

523
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,600
She hasn't contacted me again.

524
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
That's her answer.

525
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,000
Well…

526
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
Hey, baby.

527
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,500
 Where are you? 

528
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,800
I'm drinking with Shi Yan.

529
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,600
 Uh, I didn't drink. 

530
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,500
 I'm just accompanying him. We're leaving soon. 

531
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,400
Shi Yan?

532
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
You're with Shi Yan?

533
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah.

534
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,400
You don't believe me? Do you want me to take a picture of him?

535
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,800
He's drowning his sorrows in alcohol over love. I can't leave him alone, you know.

536
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,400
He's heartbroken?

537
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,300
 My dear Shuyi is really the heartbroken one. 

538
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,600
 She's pining away. 

539
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,000
 Shi Yan is beside you. Right? 

540
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,100
 Then ask him when he'll stop tormenting Shuyi. 

541
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,400
Was it he or Yi Yang who brought Shuyi home that night?

542
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,700
 What's the point of doing it without admitting it? 

543
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,400
So… Ms. Zheng has no feelings for Yi Yang. Right?

544
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,200
I wish she did.

545
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,300
She has no feelings for Yi Yang at all.

546
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,000
 She told me recently she didn't want to bother with love. 

547
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 That she just wanted to focus on her career. 

548
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,800
I think it'll take her three to five years to get over it.

549
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,400
What?

550
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,400
Hello. I'm hanging up.

551
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Shi Yan's dead silent. I'm so worried.

552
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,500
Baby, I miss you.

553
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,300
 See you tomorrow. 

554
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,500
What are you thinking?

555
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,400
I've never seen you like this before.

556
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,500
I don't know.

557
