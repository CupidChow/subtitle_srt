00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,600
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,800
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,300
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,600
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,200
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,600
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,600
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,000
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
 how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,300
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
   

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200
   

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,800
I remember your boyfriend is from our school's Computer Science Department. Right?

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,600
He's also on good terms with Chen Yueding.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,700
Why didn't he come with you?

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,600
We broke up. I don't know if he's coming or not.

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,700
Brokeâ€¦

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,200
I thought you wouldn't come.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm not the one who did something wrong.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
Why wouldn't I come?

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,000
You should have brought your boyfriend.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,600
You have one. Right?

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,300
Yeah, that'sâ€¦

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
You brat! Why did you come so late?

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
I was held up on the way.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
- Wishing you a happy marriage. Congratulations, congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,700
Congratulations, happy marriage.

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,100
Thank you.

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,200
So, coming up, who will be the lucky one to catch

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,100
the bridal bouquet from the bride's hand?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Congratulations to this lucky one.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
Please hand the microphone to this beautiful lady.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Miss, do you have a boyfriend?

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,400
 Even if I were single for ten years, I should say I have one at a time like this. 

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
I do.

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
It must be fate.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,100
Miss, you and your boyfriend will surely find true happiness together.

47
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,200
Congratulations to you.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,700
Thank you.

49
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,900
 Is the wedding fun? 

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,300
 No, it's not fun. 

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
   

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
 I met someone annoying. 

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,900
 I'm super upset. 

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Uncle, what are you going to Qing'an for?

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
I've already told you.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
When did you tell me?

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,000
When you get to Qing'an, you make your own plans.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
We agreed on it.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,500
Of course.

60
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,600
After you arrive, don't just look for me.

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,700
I have my own plans.

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,700
 Yu You, guess where I am. 

63
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,400
 I'm on the way to Qing'an. 

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,000
 Can you show me around Qing'an? 

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,400
 Sorry, I'm visiting relatives with my parents. 

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,000
 Tomorrow, it's time for your third vaccine shot. 

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
 He remembers. 

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
 It's okay. Anyway, I'll still be here for several days. 

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Xingzhou, I want to drink soup.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,700
Get me one.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No green onions.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
Xingzhou, I want to eat that shrimp.

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Peel it for me.

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Xingzhou, why are you so nice?

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Shuyi, when do you plan to get married?

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't have such plans for now.

78
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
It should be soon. Right?

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Your boyfriend isn't coming with you this time?

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Is he from out of town?

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
What does your boyfriend do?

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,300
Is he in the same profession as you?

83
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,600
That's good.

84
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Since he's in the same profession, there's a common language.

85
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
And you can help each other at work.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Is he a journalist, too?

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
No.

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,200
He must be from the financial sector. Right?

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
That's good.

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,800
Men in the finance sector have good qualities and high education.

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,300
Yeah, I know him.

92
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,500
He's well-educated and very outstanding in all aspects.

93
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,600
He studied bachelor's and master's consecutively overseas.

94
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,300
He's an executive in an investment company, earns a super high annual salary.

95
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,700
As for his looks, he's also very handsome.

96
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,500
His personality is also very amiable.

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
He's got almost no shortcomings.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,300
It's justâ€¦

99
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,500
It's just that he's a bit old.

100
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,700
And he's married, that's all.

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,500
- Married? 
 - Really?

102
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,000
 Oh my, he's a married man. 

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
 Yet she mingled with him. 

104
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,800
You can just pretend I'm talking nonsense.

106
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,300
One shall not spread rumors.

107
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,000
I understand this principle better than you.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,400
Of course.

109
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,000
You're indeed most well-seasoned in destroying other people's relationships.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,200
I haven't learned that trick yet.

111
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
Zheng Shuyi!

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,500
Enough, stop talking.

113
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
 If you're unhappy, don't stay. 

114
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,600
 I'm outside. Come out. 

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,400
I have something else. I'll go first.

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
Uhâ€¦

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
Should we tell Yueding first?

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,800
- Have someone check her. 
 - Right.

119
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,000
Yue Xingzhou, you were mean to me for her.

120
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,400
 Why does it have to be you? 

121
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,500
 Why is it you who rushes over in no time? 

122
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,200
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,200
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

124
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:04,200
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,800
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

126
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,600
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

127
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:20,000
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

129
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
â€‹â™«  Even if itâ€™s a short escape from the burning original intention  â™«

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
You just let them bully you at the wedding. Are you sure you're a tough grown-up?

131
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,500
â™«  We can still be immersed in each other  â™«

132
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Why are you glaring at me?

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Did I bully you?

134
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,100
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

135
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,200
Let's go.

136
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,000
â€‹â™«  That's why we can easily find one another  â™«

137

138
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,800
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

139
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,700
â™«  Reunited after being freed by brave loneliness  â™«

140
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,400
â™«  We will run forward with all of our might  â™«

141
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,000
Lezhi. Leâ€¦

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,400
â™«  Shining brightly  â™«

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
What are you looking at?

144
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Shouldn't you come over and greet your aunt?

145
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,000
How could it be?

146
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,600
How could she be with Mr. Shi?

147
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,000
 When did Shuyi find out that my uncle isâ€¦ 

148
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Lezhi, why are you here?

149
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,800
Unâ€¦ Uncle.

150
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm here for a wedding.

151
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
 Uncle? 

152
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,400
 Mr. Fan is her uncle? 

153
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,600
Uncle?

154
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,400
Who are these people?

155
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,600
 So you're not her uncle? 

156
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,200
 How come her uncle is your driver? 

157
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
 What have I been doing these past months? 

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
 It's over! 

159
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,000
 I'm going to die here today. 

160
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,800
Shuyi,

161
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm really sorry about today.

162
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,600
I didn't take good care of things and made some bad arrangements.

163
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm truly sorry.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,400
No worries.

165
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
I should be the one apologizing.

166
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,500
I caused unpleasantness at your wedding.

167
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,300
- What's going on? 
 - I don't know.

168
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,800
Seems like the girl in red said the girl sitting in the car was a homewrecker.

169
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,400
A mistress of an executive or something.

170
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,100
She got angry after being called a mistress and left immediately

171
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,400
I guess her real boyfriend has arrived.

172
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,300
What a misunderstanding. It must be super awkward.

173
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,400
If someone stole my boyfriend and slandered my reputation,

174
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,700
I would definitely tear her mouth.

175
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I didn't expect that she would slander you in public.

176
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,300
Iâ€¦

177
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,700
Shuyi, I'm really sorry.

178
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll apologize to you more properly another day.

179
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,800
- Sorry. 
 - No worries.

180
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
It was just a misunderstanding.

181
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,600
It wasn't caused by you.

182
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,100
Let it go.

183
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
Let it go just like that?

184
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,600
You slandered my girl.

185
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
And you want to just leave it be?

186
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,300
Did you ask me?

187
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,800
 Brother, my big brother, stop talking. 

188
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
 You know nothing, so please stay out of it. 

189
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,600
Mr. Shiâ€¦

190
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,000
Mr. Shi, actuallyâ€¦

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,900
I didn't ask you to explain.

192
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,400
I don't want to know the process or the truth.

193
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,500
I need you to apologize.

194
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,500
Is that it?

196
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,100
Miss Zheng, I am really sorry.

197
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,800
I spoke nonsense without confirming the truth.

198
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,280
Please forgive my rashness.

199
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,500
Forgive me, please!

200
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,100
 No, the rash one isn't you, it's me. 

201
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Fine, apology accepted.

202
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,000
Let's go.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Yes, Mr. Shi.

204
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
Yue Xingzhou,

205
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
look what you've got me into!

206
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,500
Have I done anything wrong to you?

207
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Some people really are shameless.

208
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,400
They play dirty tricks themselves and they think everyone else is like them.

209
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Let's go. The food is getting cold.

210
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,800
Are you still eating or not?

211
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Let's go.

212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
Let's eat.

213
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,300
According to the invitation, you should bring a family member.

214
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,000
A family member means a sentient human being. Right?

215
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,900
How come someone showed up with only a mouth but no brain?

216
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,200
What's going on?

217
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,400
What's what?

218
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,000
I just got it wrong.

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,700
When she came to our company, Mr. Qiu was all protective of her.

220
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,100
- I naturally assumedâ€¦ 
 - I'm not talking about that.

221
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm talking about your uncle.

222
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,681
What's with my uncle?

223
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,600
What does my uncle have to do with you?

224
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,400
- You! 
 - What about me?

225
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,100
Did I ever say who my uncle is?

226
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,600
All this is your own speculation.

227
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
Now you're blaming me?

228
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Yue Xingzhou, you're outrageous.

229
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,200
 I'd rather disappear from this world. 

230
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,600
Is it too hot here?

231
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,700
I'm not cold.

232
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Explain what happened today.

233
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,200
Explainâ€¦ what?

234
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,200
You mean those people?

235
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
No biggie.

236
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
It's just that the girl spoke ill of me at the banquet.

237
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,200
Speaking of whichâ€¦

238
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,900
Why did you suddenly come here?

239
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,600
To see the stars.

240
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Stars?

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
The air quality here isn't good.

242
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,500
I don't think you can see stars.

243
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,700
- Hello? 
  - Hey, Sister Shuyi. 

244
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,900
Are you home right now?

245
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,400
I just came to your hometown.

246
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,800
Do you have time to come out for a hot spring trip?

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,200
Sure.

248
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
I almost forgot our plan.

249
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,700
 I definitely won't stand you up. See you in a bit. 

250
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
What plan?

251
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,600
Hello?

252
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,600
 Zheng Shuyi, calm down. 

253
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
 You'll give yourself away if you panic. 

254
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,200
Wellâ€¦

255
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
Anything you want?

256
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:53,599
A friend asked me out to a hot spring.

257
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I don't know if youâ€¦

258
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,600
Uhâ€¦

259
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
The night view in my hometown is very famous.

260
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,800
You can take a look.

261
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,200
Andâ€¦ our grouper fish is also very special.

262
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,800
You can try it if you have a chance.

263
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,600
Are you avoiding me?

264
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,900
 You're too clever. 

265
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,000
How could I avoid you?

266
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm so happy that you're going to my place.

267
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,700
But I really have plans with a friend today.

268
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Is that so? You're not going on a blind date, are you?

269
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,100
What blind date?

270
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,200
Do I look like I have time?

271
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,600
Where do you get off?

272
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,800
Here is fine.

273
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
As you wish.

274
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,300
Sister Shuyi agreed right away.

275
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,200
Then she must be by herself. Right?

276
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Could it be that my uncle didn't go and find her?

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
 Uncle, where are you going? 

278
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,500
 Qing'an. 

279
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
 Where are you going? 

280
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,800
 I plan to have fun somewhere. 

281
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,000
 I can also hang out in Qing'an. 

282
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,800
 Isn't Qing'an Sister Shuyi's hometown? 

283
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,000
 So, it's very possible that my uncle went out for her. 

284
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,600
 That's the only reason why he left on the fourth day of the New Year. 

285
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,500
But Sister Shuyi already has someone in her heart.

286
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,800
Then my uncleâ€¦

287
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,500
No. I have to help him.

288
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,600
- Shanshan. 
  - I'm playing mahjong. Let's talk later. 

289
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,300
 I'll win next round! 

290
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,500
Next round? Your friend here is dying this round!

291
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm going to take a call.

292
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Okay, tell me. What happened?

293
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:28,000
This is quite serious.

294
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,700
After all, Shi Yan is no ordinary person.

295
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,600
If he finds out about this, you two are definitely done for.

296
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,300
 If he's a real grudge-holder, he may take away all your resources in your line of work. 

297
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm not scaring you.

298
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
But everyone's can do crazy things for love.

299
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,200
That's not what I fear.

300
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,700
 I'm afraid I'll lose him. 

301
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,600
Shanshan, do you think I should tell him the truth?

302
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,400
If he really likes me and loves me, he will forgive me. Right?

303
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Listen to me.

304
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,450
I thinkâ€¦ since this is only between us,

305
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,200
since no one else knows anything aboutâ€¦

306
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,700
Does anyone else know about this?

307
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,200
Actually, there is one.

308
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,500
Who?

309
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
 Qin Shiyue. 

310
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
 But I only roughly told her about it. 

311
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,300
I didn't give her specific names.

312
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,100
 Then no worries. Shiyue doesn't know whom exactly you are pursuing. 

313
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,400
Don't worry.

314
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,300
Since Shi Yan can't find out the truth then you continue to act as if nothing happened.

315
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,000
 Be a nice and sweet girlfriend, be vague about whatever happened, and you're safe. 

316
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Uhâ€¦ your advice isâ€¦

317
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,600
 My advice is perfect. 

318
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,500
Don't you like him a lot?

319
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,200
Then just pretend nothing happened.

320
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,300
 Go on dating him as usual. 

321
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,940
Sister Shuyi, you seem unwell.

322
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,560
Celebrating the Spring Festival is tiring.

323
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,320
Same here. At our age, we can't play around like kids anymore.

324
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,308
But we can't really hang out with older family members.

325
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:29,240
We can only sit there, doing nothing.

326
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,539
It feels like boring meditation.

327
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,519
Stop thinking about it. Let's just relax today.

328
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,159
Sister Shuyi,

329
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,319
how are things going on with Yu You?

330
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,620
There's nothing.

331
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,380
I just hang out with him to stop my parents from nagging.

332
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,139
After a while, it will probably be over.

333
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:10,828
Well, the person you were pursuingâ€¦

334
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:13,620
How's it going?

335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,900
Nothing happened.

336
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,120
You stopped pursuing?

337
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,825
Forget about it. It's too complicated and difficult.

338
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,100
True.

339
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,920
They say a woman need only move a finger to win over a man's heart.

340
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,959
But it also depends on what kind of man is being chased.

341
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:33,000
 But for someone like my uncle, you can't only move a finger. 

342
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,690
 You have to move mountains. 

343
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,699
Sister Shuyi, don't be too sad.

344
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:45,000
Maybeâ€¦ I should introduce my uncle to you.

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,341
He's definitely more handsome and richer than that home-wrecker's uncle.

346
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:49,839
No need.

347
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,020
I don't want to meet any "uncle" now.

348
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,579
Don't think too much. Shuyi you're radiant now.

349
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,640
Let's take a selfie.

350
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
Good.

351
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,219
 I'm in Qing'an now. I just enjoyed the hot spring with a friend. 

352
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,819
 Is she the supervisor you were talking about? She's so beautiful. 

353
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:19,408
 Your complexion is much better after the soak. 

354
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:22,599
 Watch out for you two's safety. 

355
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,100
 Uncle, Shuyi got hurt in her relationship. 

356
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,899
 This is a good opportunity to make a move. 

357
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:37,330
 Hesitation leads to defeat. 

358
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,710
 Decisiveness leads to a win. 

359
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,839
Are you really not considering it again?

360
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,379
My uncle is really nice.

361
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,700
 What a coincidenceâ€¦ 

362
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,499
Uncle.

363
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:21,400
 Uncle? 

364
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,480
 Uncle! 

365
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:27,195
How did you get hurt in your relationship?

366
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:31,540
 I told you about it and wanted you to seize the opportunity to make a move. 

367
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,300
 But this move is too aggressive! 

368
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,079
 "How did you get hurt in your relationship?" 

369
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,960
 How insensitive! 

370
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,713
Uncle, I was just chatting with Shuyi.

371
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:51,720
And she was just hurt a little bit.

372
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,719
It's not that seriousâ€¦

373
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,240
 Or dear, you really have a knack for causing me big trouble. 

374
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,900
Return to your room.

375
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:12,799
Then I'm leaving.

376
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,820
Did I miss something?

377
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,659
Why are they suddenly holding hands?

378
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,100
Now, you can tell me how I hurt you.

379
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,080
 Qin Shiyue said I was hurt. Shi Yan naturally thought he hurt me. 

380
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,120
 If I told him other people hurt me, 

381
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,290
 he'd probably kill me right now. 

382
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,559
 Can I drag Qin Shiyue here and beat her up? 

383
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:21,920
No biggie.

384
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,240
You see, I made a mistake and thought you liked Qin Shiyue.

385
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,839
That made me feel terrible.

386
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,740
Today, I found out you came to Qing'an with her.

387
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,620
Iâ€¦ I feel bad.

388
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,899
Now I know you're her uncle.

389
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:41,308
See! If you said so earlier, I wouldn't have misunderstood in pain.

390
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:42,314
Now, it's good. I'm no longer hurt.

391
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:44,379
Now, it's good. I'm no longer hurt.

392
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,240
You talk like you really mean it.

393
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,980
So do you like me that much?

394
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,699
 This is a good question. 

395
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,419
 Good enough to send me into my grave right away. 

396
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,659
I really get jealous easily.

397
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,279
Don't dodge the question.

398
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,519
Answer me.

399
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,699
How much do you like me?

400
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,752
Compared to your ex-boyfriendâ€¦

401
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,380
Do you like him more?

402
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,500
Or do you like me more?

403
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,160
 What kind of choices are you giving me? 

404
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,600
 Can I choose neither? 

405
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,619
Of course, it's you.

406
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll believe you this time.

407
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:11,880
Then, when will you only like me?

408
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,314
 Is he really this possessive? 

409
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:29,380
 If he knew my initial intention was to get back at Yue Xingzhouâ€¦ 

410
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,060
 I'd be done for. The scenery is so beautiful here. 

411
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,960
 But I'm afraid I'll never see it again. 

412
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,419
- Hello, Dad. 
  - Shuyi, are you coming home tonight? 

413
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,340
Yes. Of course, I'll come back.

414
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,840
 No worries. You and your friend can spend more time together. 

415
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,259
I know. I'm coming back right away. Don't worry.

416
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,820
My dad is coming to pick me up. I'm going home.

417
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,480
What a good girl.

418
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,740
You must be home by dark, huh?

419
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,800
Then tomorrow you should at least play the good host. Right?

420
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,319
What?

421
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,459
Don't tell me you didn't know that I came to Qing'an for you.

422
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,755
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

423
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:39,034
â™«  Meeting again and again in the vast sea of people  â™«

424
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,300
â™«  Just passing by is considered a kind of luck  â™«

425
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:51,490
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

426
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,309
â™«  Intertwined or parallel, gathering in the vast sky  â™«

427
00:30:55,309 --> 00:31:00,179
â™«  There is an energy that attracts something like destiny  â™«

428
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,979
 People only want to believe what they want to believe. 

429
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:07,400
 If he wants to believe what he heard there's no use explaining. 

430
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,659
 I don't have a boyfriend. 

431
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:13,060
 The day I first met you, I broke up with him when I went back. 

432
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,820
 So? 

433
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,660
 Soâ€¦ 

434
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,759
 Can I pursue you? 

435
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,739
 Did your ex-boyfriend ever say you're heavy? 

436
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,559
 No one has ever held me like this. 

437
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,780
 But I think you have the potential to become my first boyfriend to say that. 

438
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,279
 Shi Yan, I will definitely love you whole-heartedly. 

439
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,424
 I won't let you down. 

440
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,839
â™«  Maybe, we were all shining stars  â™«

441
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,079
 Zheng Shuyi, 

442
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,290
 no matter why you approached me, 

443
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,230
 I just want you to tell me the truth. 

444
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,373
 I can give you whatever you want. 

445
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:53,047
â™«  No matter where the end is  â™«

446
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:58,720
â™«  No matter how this fate started  â™«

447
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,240
Mr. Shi, I want to confirm with you about the room for tomorrow night.

448
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,839
Yes.

449
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,000
You came back so early.

450
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,200
Youâ€¦

451
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,819
Which friend did you meet?

452
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,799
 Then, when will you only like me? 

453
00:32:45,594 --> 00:32:47,240
What's up?

454
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,079
Mr. Shiâ€¦

455
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:54,279
I'm here today specially to apologize for my niece.

456
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,939
Go on.

457
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,699
My niece was in the wrong.

458
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:02,340
She ruined the relationship between Ms. Zheng and her ex-boyfriend.

459
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,319
I have seriously scolded her.

460
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,599
She knows she was wrong.

461
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,819
And she has broken up with that man.

462
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:13,300
Later, I'll let her go and apologize to Ms. Zheng in person.

463
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,739
Thenâ€¦

464
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:15,839
Apologize?

465
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,379
And then have Shuyi get back together with her ex-boyfriend?

466
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,259
No. No, no, no, that's not going to happen.

467
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:24,620
They won't get back together.

468
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,372
It's justâ€¦ that man's too unreliable.

469
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:31,539
Andâ€¦ Ms. Zheng stopped right in front of the edge of the cliff.

470
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:33,240
Right in front of the edge.

471
00:33:34,757 --> 00:33:36,819
Tell me about her ex. You said he's unreliable.

472
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,400
He is too vain.

473
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,759
As a man, he doesn't want to work hard on his own.

474
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,119
He's always looking for the easy way.

475
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,294
He thought you wereâ€¦

476
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,060
He thought I was what?

477
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,100
This is all a misunderstanding.

478
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,140
He thought you were Lezhi's uncle.

479
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,379
So he dumped Ms. Zheng and got together with Lezhi.

480
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,419
 So that's what this is about. 

481
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:08,399
I see. Go rest.

482
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,180
 After all, Shi Yan is a man. 

483
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,740
 Wait till he's no longer so mad, 

484
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,270
 flirt with him a bit, and he's still yours. 

485
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:27,039
 I thought you were after money and resources. 

486
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,960
 But I was wrong. 

487
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,699
What you wanted was never me.

488
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:42,239
Sir, excuse me.

489
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,820
Should I be honest with Shi Yan?

490
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,559
 Zheng Shuyi, now you've got what you wanted. 

491
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,000
 You embarrassed me and revealed the truth to Yue Xingzhou. 

492
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,519
 Don't be happy yet. 

493
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,419
 Shi Yan still doesn't know the truth. 

494
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:42,079
 If he finds out you approached him to get revenge on me and Yue Xingzhou, 

495
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,516
 guess how he will treat you. 

496
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,102
 Do you think you're any different from me? 

497
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,579
 Your relationship also started with deception. 

498
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,679
 There will be consequences for you. 

499
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,079
 Qin Lezhi, you did something wrong. 

500
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,340
 Don't blame everything on others. 

501
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,480
 You're one to talk. 

502
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,390
 I'm not like you. 

503
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,665
   

504
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:02,603
   

505
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,839
 Let's go to the aquarium. 

506
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,931
 Tomorrow at 10:00, let's meet at the aquarium gate? 

507
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,920
Shanshan,

508
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,079
I've thought it through.

509
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,619
I really fell in love with Shi Yan.

510
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,800
I did have exterior motives when I first approached him.

511
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,139
No matter the outcome, I will tell Shi Yan everything tomorrow.

512
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:56,900
I'll apologize to him and ask for his forgiveness.

513
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,039
This way, our relationship in the future can become purer.

514
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,880
 You've really decided? Will you regret? 

515
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:19,339
I'll regret not telling the truth.

516
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:36,540
 But every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent. 

517
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,190
 And when you do... 

518
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,630
 nothing will ever compare. 

519
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,679
Who is it?

520
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,800
Uncle, why did you come?

521
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,239
Shuyi left?

522
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,440
Then, what can I do for you?

523
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,220
Nothing.

524
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,612
Iâ€¦ I can't seize the opportunity.

525
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:19,239
What should I do?

526
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,159
 Oh my! 

527
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,880
 He actually admits he can't seize the opportunity. 

528
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,639
 And he said something that could make him look lame to me. 

529
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,960
That worry's unnecessary, Uncle!

530
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,559
You're so excellent.

531
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,840
There's nobody better than you in this world.

532
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,519
You just need to try a little harder.

533
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,559
Then you can easily win over her heart.

534
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,079
Really?

535
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,800
But she has someone in her heart.

536
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,880
What can I do?

537
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,899
If it's for this reasonâ€¦

538
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:48,480
She did indeed pursue another man before.

539
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,400
But don't worry.

540
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,719
That wasn't sincere.

541
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,199
She did that for other reasons.

542
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,920
And she has already given up now.

543
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,880
This is a great opportunity for you!

544
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,280
So it is trueâ€¦

545
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,559
Listen to me.

546
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,477
Just work harâ€¦

547
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,239
What's with that pulled face?

548
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,319
 Hello. Is this Mr. Shi? 

549
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,880
 I'm the manager of the bar. 

550
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,159
 Do you have a moment now? 

551
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,800
 I'd like to confirm your reservation for tomorrow night. 

552
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,499
There's no need.

553
00:39:47,396 --> 00:39:51,275
â™«  You obviously want to get closer  â™«

554

558
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:21,463
â™«  When I turn around, I will meet the scenes of you  â™«

559
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:26,552
â™«  I predicted the rain, but I pretend not to care  â™«

560

â€‹â™«  Lost in the night  â™«

561

â™«  The words that havenâ€™t been spoken yet  â™«

562
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:38,991
â™«  The courage to transcend time  â™«

563
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:43,981
â™«  Even if I end up soaked in the rain  â™«

564
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:55,240
â™«  I'll let you know that I'm still where I am  â™«

565
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:04,279
Hello.

566
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,960
Hello, Uncle.

567
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,840
Are you still awake?

568
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,319
 Anything the matter? 

569
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,700
My stomach hurts.

570
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,599
 Put on your outfit. 

571
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,960
 Put on your outfit. 

572
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,980
I will take you to the hospital.

573
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,280
Okay.

574
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,840
Thank you.

575
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,340
Uncleâ€¦

576
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,879
You've been up all night?

577
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,459
Did you drink?

578
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,360
With whom?

579
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,740
Uncle,

580
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,380
why did you ask me those things just now?

581
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,179
Nothing.

582
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,660
Let me tell you.

583
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,199
Women are not straightforward animals.

584
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,599
You're so attractive.

585
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,599
You just have to be a bit more proactive.

586
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,179
All women will fall for you.

587
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,234
Uncle,

588
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:16,340
I'm an expert in this area.

589
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,819
Try harder and you can win over her heart.

590
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,960
Close your eyes.

591
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,980
Get some rest.

592
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,660
   

593
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,320
