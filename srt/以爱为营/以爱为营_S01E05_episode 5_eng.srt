00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,300
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,425
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

5
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:38,575
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

6
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,100
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,688
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

8
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,225
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

9
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,399
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

12
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,425
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

14
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,525
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

15
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,575
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

16
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

17
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,500
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,100
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,375
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

20
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:36,025
   

21
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,011
   

22
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:47,907
Thank you.

23
00:01:56,151 --> 00:02:00,066
How can someone schedule an interview at a racecourse?

24
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,705
He's really a horse person.

25
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:14,946
Mr. Guan, nice to meet you.

26
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:18,255
This is your precious horse?  It's so beautiful.

27
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,306
Ms. Xu, you have good taste.

28
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,457
Do you want to change into riding clothes and ride a couple of laps?

29
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:24,365
No, thanks.

30
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:26,766
Let's start the interview.

31
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:31,526
I don't think it's a good place for an interview.

32
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,526
How about grabbing a cup of coffee?

33
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:37,486
I have coffee here. It tastes good.

34
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,545
Mr. Guan, let's start.

35
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,766
Excuse me. I have to answer this.

36
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,305
Okay.

37
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,285
Hello.

38
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:52,885
Guan Ji...

39
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:55,806
Guan Ji, save me.

40
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:58,306
My uncle grounded me.

41
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:01,306
 I'll never be happy again. 

42
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,686
Yue, try accepting where you're at.

43
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,206
Shi Yan seems serious this time.

44
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:11,226
Once he makes up his mind, no one can change it.

45
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:20,726
 Shi Yan? 

46
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:24,025
 Maybe Guan Ji is the entry point. 

47
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:26,766
 Guan Ji, tell me. 

48
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:32,366
Do I look like someone who has nothing to do with the word work?

49
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,883
I've never worked.

50
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:38,446
Even if you don't work, Shi Yan won't let you stay at home.

51
00:03:38,446 --> 00:03:41,105
Calm down.

52
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,545
You can also surf on the internet there.

53
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:46,226
 Play with your phone, time will pass quickly. 

54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,486
Isn't there another way?

55
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:54,046
I don't want to waste my life here.

56
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:57,866
Princess Yue, see the truth and accept it.

57
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:01,345
For your sake, here's a word for you.

58
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:05,345
Since you can't handle Shi Yan, you can think of another way.

59
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,086
 All right, I have to go. See you. 

60
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,911
What do you mean?

61
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,465
Hello.

62
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:14,526
 I can't handle Shi Yan. 

63
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,906
 Can't I handle you? 

64
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:20,225
 Is Zheng Shuyi the only one who has means? 

65
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,285
Mr. Guan, let's continue.

66
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,405
Okay.

67
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:36,246
People in the industry say you're young and promising.

68
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,726
It is said that you're taking over Guan Captial.

69
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:41,105
I guess there will be a lot of big moves in the future,

70
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:44,065
so I wonder if I can reveal some of them?

71
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:49,686
Guan will still maintain the established industrial structure and make some innovations.

72
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:53,125
Mr. Guan really has a unique vision.

73
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:59,625
Then I wonder if you will consider bringing in more talents?

74
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:05,026
In fact, the competition among any enterprise is fundamentally a competition for talent.

75
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:08,206
Companies like Guan's are even more hungry for talent.

76
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:13,465
We will open the door to outstanding talent at any time.

77
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,499
Thank you, Mr. Guan, for sharing.

78
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:36,544
Mr. Guan, I have a personal question for you.

79
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:39,026
 Is she going to ask me for my contact details? 

80
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:42,126
 She will say it is to confirm the content of the interview. 

81
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,365
Could you give me your contact details?

82
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:50,526
It is to confirm the content of the interview.

83
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:00,666
Mr. Guanâ€™s horse is really the best among horses.

84
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,605
Such a character.

85
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:06,646
No, he's just a little annoyed.

86
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:09,486
Ms. Xu, thank you for the interview.

87
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,505
I have something to do. I'll have someone take you back.

88
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,926
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

89
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:19,145
 He's a young man who loves horses and chicks. 

90
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,985
 You are nothing without your dad. 

91
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,785
 Since you can't handle Shi Yan, you can think of another way. 

92
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,425
 Since you can't handle Shi Yan, you can think of another way. 

93
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:33,446
Another way.

94
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:36,085
What other way?

95
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,205
Mr. Shi,

96
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:03,266
I've found out where Lieying's funding came from.

97
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,169
It's from Mingyu Group.

98
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,201
You already knew.

99
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,806
I didn't. Now I do.

100
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,885
What do we do?

101
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,646
It is Mingyu Group's business to lend money or not.

102
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,726
We should mind our own business.

103
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:24,425
Do you need to call Mr. Qin to warn him?

104
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,066
Lieying helped Mingyu Group.

105
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,225
We should be grateful.

106
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:32,365
Mingyu Group never throws money around.

107
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,284
They lent money to Lieying.

108
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,046
It means they think it's worth it.

109
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:38,645
We have no reason to stop them.

110
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,526
Shuyi, this is your group's intern.

111
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:58,126
You can get to know each other.

112
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:02,445
Hello, I am Zheng Shuyi.

113
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,662
Hope we can work well together.

114
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,780
Hello, I am Qin Shiyue.Nice to meet you.

115
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,146
This is your desk.

116
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:11,066
You can put things down.

117
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,785
Okay.

118
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:50,526
The intern has played with her phone for more than an hour.

119
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:51,746
She looks confused.

120
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:54,735
You should give her some work.

121
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,665
Confused?

122
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:59,046
She looks happy.

123
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:59,605
Ms. Shuyi, this is a gift for you.

124
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,425
I just came to work and I donâ€™t understand anything.

125
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,785
Please take good care of me in the future.

126
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,226
No need for gifts.

127
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:12,786
In the coming months, ask me anything you don't understand.

128
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,886
I will give you some assignments.

129
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,765
Now?

130
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:19,686
 Excuse me. 

131
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,226
 It's kind of rude. 

132
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:24,906
 I gave you a gift. Why are you assigning work to me? 

133
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:29,406
This recorder has a recording of my previous interview.

134
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:33,266
Take it. And transcribe the questions and answers accordingly.

135
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,646
Learn to write the first draft. Give it to me before the end of the day.

136
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,305
Okay.

137
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,200
SY.

138
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
What a coincidence.

139
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
 I know how to take notes. 

140
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 It's Chinese, not English. 

141
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
 It's not a big deal. 

142
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,400
  Will Mingyu Cloud Innovation and Guan Captal's cooperation be announced soon? 

143
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,600
 Are you getting into something you're both interested in? 

144
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,200
 Why do you think we want to cooperate? 

145
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
 What do you think we are going to do? 

146
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
 My uncle? 

147
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,200
 I don't think it's an interview. 

148
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
 It's just chatting. 

149
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 There are no questions and answers. 

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,100
Two hours?

151
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,800
How could they talk for so long?

152
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,800
He doesn't talk much.

153
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,390
   

154
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Hello, Mr. Chen.

155
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,100
Please help me.

156
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Okay. I got it, Ms. Qin.

157
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I will finish it as soon as possible.

158
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,300
Please. I have to hand it in before the end of the day.

159
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,400
Thank you.

160
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,800
 Don't do it again. 

161
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
Otherwise, you will be my assistant.

162
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
- Following the processâ€¦ 
 - Mr. Shi, please wait a second.

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Mr. Shi, please don't go in there.

164
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Sorry to bother you.

165
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,600
Mr. Shi, long time.

166
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
What brings you here?

167
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
I will talk to Mr. Chen first.

168
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
We will talk later.

169
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,700
Business is business. I'm not here to stop you from negotiating.

170
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,200
Mr. Chen, here's a piece of advice for you.

171
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,900
Don't sacrifice your roots and Le'an's future for immediate benefits.

172
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,900
Mr. Shi, I don't know how long I can last.

173
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,500
This money is so important for us.

174
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,400
Mr. Shi, you know the source of the money.

175
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,300
Chen Kang, do you know what the interest rate is on this money?

176
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,600
It's 3% higher than the normal interest rate.

177
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Once you take the money,

178
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,800
you will bear the interest with Lieying.

179
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,600
Your most cherished technological achievements will be monetized at once.

180
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Technology development will also lose its sustainability.

181
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,900
Mr. Shi, it's not fair for you to say that.

182
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,700
Lieying and Mingyu Cloud Innovation value Le'an's technology.

183
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,300
We want to develop it with Le'an.

184
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Once Le'an is acquired, you will lose the right to decide,

185
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,900
and your team will be saddled with loans with Lieying.

186
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,600
How do you and your team solve the technical challenges?

187
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,000
Chip technology is a blue ocean.

188
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,900
I hope you don't make the wrong decision on impulse.

189
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Mr. Shi, my team worked hard for years,

190
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,200
we want achievements, but we also want to make money.

191
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,900
We get along well, but...

192
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
I made a long-term plan for Le'an.

193
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,700
I planned a pool of funds,

194
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,000
which will fund Le'an's R&amp;D in phases.

195
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Of course, the premise is that you have the confidence to continue to engage in R&amp;D.

196
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,000
I promise you.

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,900
If Le'an accepts Mingyu Cloud Innovation's investment,

198
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,800
Le'an's independence and strategy remain the same,

199
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,300
your commitment to your employees remains the same.

200
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,400
In a word, Mingyu Cloud Innovation's investment will not interfere with

201
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,600
and shake the development of Le'an.

202
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
I hope you will remain true,

203
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,700
while you protect your team.

204
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,800
Iâ€¦

205
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,100
Mr. Chen, do you know what attracts an investor the most?

206
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,000
It's not the price or the product.

207
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's something more important.

208
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,900
What's that?

209
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,700
A level-headed manager.

210
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,600
Talent is the most important factor in an enterprise.

211
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,400
You're not at the end of your rope yet.

212
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,600
I don't want you to destroy the whole thing.

213
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
As long as you are willing to stick to it,

214
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
Le'an will have a bright future.

215
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,800
The other day, a journalist told me the same thing.

216
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Mr. Shi, I will consider your offer.

217
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,500
I will think about it.

218
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,900
There may be another option for Le'an.

219
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
I am sorry, Mr. Li.

220
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you for your offer.

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,500
I think I need some time to think about our cooperation again.

222
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,100
I am sorry.

223
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,300
Come on.

224
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,600
I've been writing it for a long time.

225
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,400
Ms. Shuyi.

226
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,200
Ms. Shuyi.

227
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Ms. Shuyi.

228
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,200
Seriously?

229
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,800
 Don't do it again. 

230
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,100
 Otherwise, you will be my assistant. 

231
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,100
I'd like you to meet Cheng Beier.

232
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,600
She is an intern.

233
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,400
Please take care of her.

234
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,100
Hello, everyone.

235
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,000
 She is so young. 

236
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I heard that she graduated from a prestigious school. 

237
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,700
 She is a girl who loves to be clean. 

238
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
 But she doesn't like to work. 

239
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Shuyi, where is that intern?

240
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Why isn't she here?

241
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,900
- She's off work. 
 - So early?

242
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
It's time to get off work. So she left.

243
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,000
Beier, let's go.

244
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We have work to do.

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

246
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,500
- Wait for me. 
 - Okay.

247
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
I've checked it out.

248
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,300
Cheng Beier graduated from the top media college in China.

249
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,800
She ranked first in her major category.

250
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,200
And she won the national scholarship three years in a row.

251
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,800
She has a double major in Finance.

252
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,400
She won prizes for her papers.

253
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,000
Look at your intern.

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm not unbalanced at all.

255
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,200
Her family is also engaged in finance.

256
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,600
Her aunt is an executive of Mingyu Group.

257
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,100
She has a strong background,

258
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,700
but she works hard.

259
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,000
She worked overtime on the first day of her internship.

260
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm so stressed.

261
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,000
No comparison, no sadness.

262
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,200
Here, eat some meat.

263
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,000
- Get some protein. 
 - Thanks.

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Here. Your favorite.

265
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,800
Eat more.

266
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
- Grandpa, you don't know about it. 
 - What happened?

267
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,400
I worked so hard today.

268
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,600
- Really? 
 - I am so exhausted.

269
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,400
Dad, I am back.

270
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,000
Eat something.

271
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Didn't you say that you were exhausted?

272
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,000
How can you eat so fast?

273
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,200
Grandpa, look at him.

274
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
I had a long day.

275
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,700
But he gives me that attitude.

276
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,400
And he doesn't want me to eat.

277
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,100
Do you think I am his niece?

278
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,800
What are you doing if you don't eat when you're eating?

279
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Donâ€™t bring home the same aggressive behavior you used at work.

280
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,600
She's your niece.

281
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,400
Thank you, Grandpa.

282
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
My uncle may not love me.

283
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,800
But my grandpa loves me.

284
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,400
Shi Yan, I have a question.

285
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,800
Why did you arrange for her to be a journalist?

286
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,600
She is a graduate. She should go to work.

287
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,700
She can't do anything else.

288
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,200
Mr. Guan asked a friend to give her an internship at the magazine.

289
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,000
How was your day?

290
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Didn't you hear everything?

291
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,300
I was asked to transcribe a two-hour recording.

292
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,000
I am not a typist.

293
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
I listened to the interview.

294
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,200
That's chatting, not an interview.

295
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,500
You were asked to type?

296
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
Who is your manager?

297
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,200
A woman named Zheng.

298
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Zheng Shuyi?

299
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Yes, it's her.

300
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Do your job well.

301
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
She's your manager.

302
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,600
You should be humble and learn from her.

303
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
I wanted to.

304
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,800
But she didn't want to teach me.

305
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Why do you say that?

306
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,500
If you donâ€™t understand, itâ€™s never wrong to ask.

307
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,800
I tried to ask her many times,

308
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,900
She completely ignored me without even raising her eyes.

309
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,400
I thought she was busy.

310
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
So I wanted to consult her after work.

311
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
But after waiting for more than half an hour. I had to leave.

312
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
She didnâ€™t even look at me.

313
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,600
I don't think it's good to bully a rookie in the workplace.

314
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,600
Let's eat, Dad.

315
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,700
 Did my uncle receive my bad radio waves? 

316
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,500
 So many people here. 

317
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,700
Come on.

318
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,500
Sit down.

319
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,600
Sit. Sit.

320
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
This is Mr. Guan from Guan Capital.

321
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
We are good friends.

322
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,000
- Mr. Guan. 
 - Mr. Guan.

323
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Letâ€™s get to know each other.

324
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,800
- Mr. Guan, cheers. 
 - Mr. Guan, cheers.

325
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,700
Mr. Guan, may I have your WeChat? We can hang out later.

326
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,800
Please.

327
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,100
Iâ€¦

328
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,100
There you are.

329
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,000
I've been waiting for you in the car for a long time.

330
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,900
I am sorry, baby.

331
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,700
I have to go.

332
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,500
Are you upset about my popularity?

333
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,600
I understand what it's like to be pestered by someone I don't like,

334
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,800
so I helped you out.

335
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,800
How do you know I don't like them?

336
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,300
That's me meddling in other people's business. I'm leaving now.

337
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,100
That's me meddling in other people's business. I'm leaving now.

338
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
I will walk you out.

339
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
There are many female companions waiting for you.

340
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,400
Don't bother me.

341
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I only have you as my female companion.

342
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
   

343
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,100
Done.

344
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,200
 The lead editor and I have read your manuscript. 

345
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,400
 It's good. I've sent it to Shi Yan. 

346
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,800
 I am waiting for his reply. 

347
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,500
 Good job. 

348
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,400
 Thank you. 

349
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,800
If only I had Shi Yan's WeChat.

350
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,700
I don't know if the feature is okay or not.

351
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,400
It would be nice if I could just ask him directly.

352
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,400
Dad, have some tea.

353
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,400
I heard you went horseback riding this weekend.

354
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,700
And you brought a girl.

355
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,600
Mr. Guan said you haven't been there for a long time.

356
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,900
Have you been busy at work lately?

357
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,400
I am working on the cooperation with Le'an.

358
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I've heard about it.

359
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,200
Xiaoming is working on the cooperation with Lieying.

360
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,300
I know. I just got back from Le'an before dinner.

361
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,200
Mingyu Group moves fast.

362
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,500
When I got there this afternoon, Lieying was there.

363
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,100
Do you need to talk to your brother-in-law?

364
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,500
He was supposed to come for dinner.

365
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,800
But he went to handle Lieying's business.

366
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,800
Business is business.

367
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,000
Lieying's interest rate is low.

368
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
He did nothing wrong.

369
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,000
I can understand it.

370
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,600
In other words,

371
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,600
if Le'an is attracted by Lieying's acquisition funds,

372
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,100
I will re-evaluate whether this company is the one

373
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
I want to work with for the long term.

374
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,900
Mingyu Group has been established for 23 years.

375
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:40,200
These uncles of yours were also very business savvy and capable back then.

376
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,900
They are also very affectionate and righteous.

377
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,770
They went through ups and downs with Mingyu Group.

378
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,940
Sometimes,

379
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,000
you should listen to what they think.

380
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,800
At this stage,

381
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,400
you still need to continue to learn and strengthen yourself.

382
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,700
Even if they don't think like you do

383
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,800
and can't help your career,

384
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:13,000
you should not let them become obstacles that stand in your way.

385
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
Okay, Dad.

386
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,600
It's late. Go back home.

387
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Thank you, Dad.

388
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I will leave.

389
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,700
Rest early, Dad. Okay.

390
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,700
   

391
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,400
Professor Yu, do you have time in two days?

392
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
 I'm going rock climbing. 

393
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Would you like to come with me? 

394
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,400
Rock climbing?

395
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,800
Will it be relaxing?

396
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,500
Send me the address.

397
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,200
 No problem. 

398
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,870
    
    

399
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,550
   

400
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,600
The manuscript was approved?

401
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,200
I think you sent it last night.

402
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
The chief editor and lead editor replied to me last night.

403
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
They thought it was good.

404
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,800
They sent it to Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

405
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,400
 Uncle, prove that you are my uncle. 

406
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,500
Good morning, Shiyue.

407
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Good morning.

408
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
 Ms. Tiantian, could you help me with it? 

409
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
 Okay. 

410
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
 What do I do about this? 

411
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Yue, don't eat too quickly.

412
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
It could cause indigestion.

413
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
How is it?

414
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,400
Did they compliment your manuscript?

415
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,000
 Rejected? Why? 

416
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,800
 They didn't write the reason. 

417
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,100
 What does that mean? 

418
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,000
 My uncle loves me. 

419
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,300
    
    

420
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
   

421
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,000
Shuyi, your group doesn't need to submit a topic this week.

422
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Finish Shi Yan's manuscript first.

423
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,000
Yuling, you interviewed Guan Ji.

424
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Be prepared to be a standby.

425
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
Okay, Chief Editor.

426
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Shuyi, you haven't been looking great recently.

427
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
Take care of yourself.

428
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Don't push yourself so hard.

429
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
Okay, dismissed.

430
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,000
Shuyi, wait a second.

431
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,400
What's the matter with you?

432
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,300
Did you make him unhappy during your interview?

433
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,000
Did you make him unhappy during your interview?

434
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
I don't think so.

435
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
I am the one who's upset.

436
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,100
I hate horseback riding.

437
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
What's he got to be upset about?

438
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
What's the matter then?

439
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,000
He didn't give clear suggestions for changes.

440
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,600
Talk to Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

441
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
Ask them for clear suggestions.

442
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Revise the manuscript as soon as possible.

443
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,900
All right.

444
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,200
This is Shi Yan's first interview.

445
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,000
We don't know him well.

446
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,400
Maybe he has some requirements.

447
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,200
Do your best to make him happy.

448
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,000
The deadline is approaching.

449
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,200
You could send him a WeChat message.

450
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,800
Say something nice.

451
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,900
Ask Shi Yan what he thinks.

452
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,100
What?

453
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,600
Are you embarrassed?

454
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,300
It's not like you.

455
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,000
I am not embarrassed.

456
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,100
I don't have his WeChat.

457
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Why didn't you tell me that?

458
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,800
I will text you Shi Yan's phone number.

459
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,400
Contact him. Be nice.

460
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,500
Check your WeChat.

461
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,600
What did I do?

462
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,500
Even if I offended him, he shouldn't act like this.

463
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,700
This is work.

464
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:59,714
Come up.

465
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:46,766
I didn't expect you to be good at rock climbing.

466
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:51,392
Let's go.

467
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:05,226
You're competing with your parent company?

468
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:07,042
Not exactly.

469
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,206
Once Mingyu Group lends the funds to Lieying,

470
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:11,585
whether Lieying buys Le'an or not,

471
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:14,245
they should pay back the money to Mingyu Group.

472
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:19,565
The competition between Mingyu Cloud Innovation and Lieying won't hurt Mingyu Group.

473
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:24,205
In the long run, Mingyu Group profits from Mingyu Cloud Innovation's investment in Le'an.

474
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:28,543
You want me to contact Bruce. Right?

475
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:29,625
Right.

476
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:33,185
I looked him up. He was your alumnus and colleague.

477
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:36,445
Please give me a hand.

478
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:38,406
It's not hard to reach him.

479
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:41,126
But it's not easy to convince him to join Le'an.

480
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:46,006
As far as I know, companies at home and abroad made high offers to hire him.

481
00:34:46,006 --> 00:34:48,560
But Bruce didn't accept any of them.

482
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,100
He thinks the school research office

483
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:54,725
makes him more focused and inspires him.

484
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,486
If this is important to you,

485
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:01,105
you can contact other experts.

486
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:06,526
Professor Bruce is an authority on millimeter wave communication.

487
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:11,246
If he can't solve the problem Le'an faces, no one else can.

488
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:14,706
And breaking through this technical problem is of great significance.

489
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:17,585
It's not just about business.

490
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,105
Since you put it that way,

491
00:35:20,105 --> 00:35:22,045
I will give it a try.

492
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,045
I'll keep it in mind.

493
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:26,026
Then I'm waiting for your good news.

494
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,466
Okay.

495
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:31,566
Would you like to race again?

496
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:33,045
Okay.

497
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:35,266
I won't let you win.

498
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,700
   

499
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:02,106
 Hello, Mr. Shi. 

500
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:03,725
 I am Zheng Shuyi. 

501
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:04,786
 Sorry to bother you. 

502
00:36:04,786 --> 00:36:07,805
 I have some questions about the manuscript. 

503
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:10,726
 Looking forward to your reply. Thank you. 

504
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:32,084
   

505
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:36,006
Is his phone silent?

506
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:38,485
Did he turn on Do-Not-Disturb?

507
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:41,206
Did he block me?

508
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:45,225
Doesn't he answer unknown calls?

509
00:36:46,986 --> 00:36:48,726
You are expensive.

510
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:51,026
But you didn't receive any reply.

511
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:52,946
What is the use of you?

512
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,625
Mr. Chen,

513
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,426
could you help me contact Mr. Shi?

514
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:18,306
Here's the thing. I want to talk to him about something personal and urgent.

515
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:19,526
 Mr. Shi is busy. 

516
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:21,706
 I will tell him about it later. 

517
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,645
 I will reply to you soon. 

518
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:25,645
Okay, thanks.

519
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:38,765
Mr. Shi, looks like the climbing paid off.

520
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:49,565
 The other day, a journalist told me the same thing. 

521
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,225
What do you want to say?

522
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:57,126
Ms. Zheng of Financial Introduce wanted me to tell you

523
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,545
that she wanted to talk to you about something personal and urgent.

524
00:37:59,906 --> 00:38:01,145
Something personal?

525
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,286
And urgent?

526
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:04,566
She said she called you, but no one answered.

527
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:07,326
It seemed to be something urgent.

528
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:11,906
She didn't say what it was about. And I didn't ask.

529
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:14,506
Maybe you should call her back.

530
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:18,025
You think I should call her?

531
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:20,185
I will turn her down.

532
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,386
Wait.

533
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:27,130
 - Let's go. 
 - Let's go. 

534
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,190
 Let's go. 

535
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:41,045
 Mr. Shi said he doesn't talk about personal matters 

536
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:42,906
 during working hours and in the workplace. 

537
00:38:55,286 --> 00:38:56,966
He doesn't talk about personal matters

538
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,986
during working hours and in the workplace.

539
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,744
What does that mean?

540
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,205
That's an excuse to reject me.

541
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:09,146
The magazine is about to be published.

542
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,986
I can't sit and do nothing.

543
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:13,306
I should do something.

544
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:15,986
Find another way.

545
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:25,826
 Check the group chat. 

546
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:42,785
 Yi, you broke up with Yue Xingzhou? 

547
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:45,586
 Wasn't he the one who chased you? 

548
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:47,606
 She doesn't look pretty. 

549
00:39:47,606 --> 00:39:49,225
 What's wrong with him? 

550
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:52,665
 I heard her uncle was amazing. 

551
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,926
 She has the means. 

552
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,486
 There's nothing wrong with being realistic. 

553
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,346
 Shuyi, 

554
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:07,646
 their world views are distorted. 

555
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:11,145
 Date Shi Yan to shut them up. 

556
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:13,686
 What can I do? 

557
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:14,846
 He said 

558
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:18,486
 he doesn't talk about personal matters during working hours and in the workplace. 

559
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:27,665
 Then slap them in the face. 

560
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:29,666
 Didn't you want to make a special feature? 

561
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:34,266
 During work or privately, you have to take him down quickly. 

562
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:39,365
Right.

563
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:42,346
During work, he has problems with my manuscript.

564
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:44,545
I must get clear suggestions for changes.

565
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:46,845
So I can revise it.

566
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,926
For private, you still have my studs.

567
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:51,306
I didn't get them last time.

568
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:54,026
It's okay for me to get my stuff.

569
00:40:57,306 --> 00:41:00,866
For work or private, I, Zheng Shuyi, will meet you.

570
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:02,585
Good.

 I've told Bruce about your situation and thoughts. 

580
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:31,426
 He agreed to meet you. 

581
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:35,405
 But whether he's willing to stay and help Le'an depends on your performance. 

582
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:38,586
 Shi Yan, I have to say it's a long shot. 

583
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:40,006
 Shi Yan, I have to say it's a long shot. 

584
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:41,785
Okay, I get it.

585
00:41:41,785 --> 00:41:45,506
I will try my best to convince him.

586
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,726
 Good luck.

 Wait. 

589
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:59,826
 Tell her I don't talk about personal matters 

590
00:41:59,826 --> 00:42:02,705
