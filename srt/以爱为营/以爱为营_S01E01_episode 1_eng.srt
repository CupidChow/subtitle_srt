00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  A tidal wave of tears is like falling stars 
 after encountering the cold  â™«

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,525
â™«  Dreams in winter are too fragile  â™«

4
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,675
â™«  The chirping cicadas wake me from my deep sleep  â™«

5
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,200
â™«  Intoxicated under the sunset  â™«

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,825
â™«  The light fades through my fingertips  â™«

7
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:48,225
â™«  The ripples bloom in my heart like the tide  â™«

8
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,611
â™«  Let time no longer be boring  â™«

9
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:54,050
â™«  The evening breeze blows gently  â™«

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,025
â™«  I want to have a glass of lemon soda  â™«

11
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,300
â™«  A sip of summer intoxication  â™«

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,425
â™«  The sun is shining brightly and I match you perfectly  â™«

13
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,550
â™«  Add some ice for a slightly tipsy flavor  â™«

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,585
â™«  Stop frowning  â™«

15
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:13,045
â™«  Oh you are like soda, spreading the flavor of my heart  â™«

16
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,400
â™«  My hair blows in the wind, 
how many times have I fallen for you?  â™«

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,050
â™«  Waiting for the wind to get drunk, drink a few glasses, 
 love is like water  â™«

18
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,850
â™«  Tenderness is too fragmentary and cannot be taken back  â™«

19
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:36,125
   

20
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,150
   

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,220
   
   

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,270
   

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,009
Ms. Yuling, do you need any help?

24
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,130
No, thanks.

25
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,730
Please let me help you.

26
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,910
That way, I will participate in a big interview.

27
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,049
I heard the editor-in-chief highly recommended you for the interview.

28
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,490
You are the trump of our magazine.

29
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,602
You are the perfect person for this kind of interview.

30
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,890
Ms. Yuling, the sales of this interview will be outstanding.

31
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,350
The editor-in-chief entrusted me with such an important task, I will try my best to do it well.

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,909
You've lost the chance to interview Shi Yan.

33
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,369
Zheng Shuyi, why are you still working on the interview outline?

34
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,769
I think Shi Yan is unconventional.

35
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,431
I just read my outline.

36
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,850
Some of the questions are conservative.

37
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,170
I could have done better.

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,290
I want to work on it.

39
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,767
Are you insane?

40
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:43,990
Are you out of your mind because you lost your chance?

41
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,366
No matter how well you revise the outline, you can't get the chance to interview Shi Yan.

42
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:54,389
I heard that the lead editor called Mingyu Cloud Innovation and recommended her.

43
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,973
So, means are more important than strength.

44
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,040
We have a lot of interview opportunities. I can't interview Shi Yan.

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,610
But there will be Li Yan or Wang Yan.

46
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,810
You can use the means to get an interview.

47
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,049
But it takes strength to write a good interview.

48
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,316
Since I don't have the means, I can only continue to improve my strength.

49
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,364
What a pity.

50
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:18,230
You can't meet Shi Yan, and tell me if he is handsome.

51
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,870
Mr. Shi, the Financial Introduce's interview is at 7:00 after dinner.

52
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,790
Reporter Xu Yuling will come to the company to interview you.

53
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,189
I don't think the reporter I chose this Reporter Xu.

54
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,611
The Financial Introduce's lead editor highly recommended Reporter Xu.

55
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,651
He said that she had a lot of experience.

56
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,289
And her interviews have always been excellent.

57
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,490
I don't have to be present for a question-answer interview.

58
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,649
You can give them my answers.

59
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:04,350
Interviews should be enlightening conversations and reflections.

60
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,270
I like Reporter Zheng's interview outline. 
    
   

61
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,173
Sorry, I didn't think about it deeply. I will have it rearranged.

62
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,247
   

63
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:20,380
   

64
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:25,727
Ms. Yi, are you looking for me?

65
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,889
Okay, see you.

66
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:34,315
You don't have to comfort me.

67
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,170
I can understand that. I am okay.

68
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,530
What do you understand?

69
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,956
I know you want to talk to me about Shi Yan's interview.

70
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:43,609
I can understand it.

71
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,490
Ms. Yuling hasmore seniority than I do.

72
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,160
I didn't take it so well, but there is room for improvement in my outline.

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,200
I didn't take it so well, but there is room for improvement in my outline.

74
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,169
Anyway, I will take it.

75
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,729
I'll be more prepared next time.

76
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,410
I like your clothes.

77
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,330
Today is my boyfriend's birthday.

78
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,670
I dressed up for him.

79
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,170
Think of it another way. If I interview Shi Yan,

80
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,469
I won't be able to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.

81
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:13,910
I think it's a good thing.

82
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:20,996
I see.

83
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,709
What's wrong, Ms. Yi?

84
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,990
I just received a call from Cloud Innovation,

85
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,440
they said Shi Yan wanted...

86
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,954
you to interview him.

87
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,468
What a pity. You have to celebrate your boyfriend's birthday.

88
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,569
I am afraid you will not be available.

89
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:44,054
Shi Yan wanted me to interview him?

90
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:48,809
Yes, Shi Yan wanted you to interview him tonight.

91
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:50,990
Are you free tonight?

92
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,530
I am free.

93
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,459
Are you sure?

94
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, the interview is tonight at 7:00.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,289
Shi Yan's general assistant will communicate with you for details.

96
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:02,158
Okay, I will go and get ready.

97
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:04,016
Wait.

98
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,009
What about your boyfriend?

99
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,890
He has a birthday every year.

100
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,409
But there's only one chance to interview Shi Yan.

101
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:15,630
I will finish the interview as soon as I can. Maybe I will be able to celebrate his birthday before midnight.

102
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,949
Good for you, Zheng Shuyi.

103
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,986
Mr. Shi, the interview is scheduled.

104
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:28,238
What about arranging the interview in the large meeting room?

105
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,658
Isnâ€™t Leâ€™an Technology coming over for an interview this afternoon?

106
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,050
Department One booked the large meeting room for this afternoon, but they canceled it.

107
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,129
They scheduled the interviews with Lieying and Le'an in the morning.

108
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,302
- In the morning? 
 - Yes.

109
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:47,089
The system shows that. Director Feng of Department One rescheduled it.

110
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,384
Old Fan, drop me off.

111
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,738
I need to go back to the office.

112
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:58,708
Got it, Mr. Shi.

113
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,070
What about Ms. Qin?

114
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,830
You pick her up and take her to the old house.

115
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,489
Got it.

116
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,209
Good job.

117
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,530
You've written nine front-page articles this year.

118
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,909
You have set a record for our magazine.

119
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:33,189
The lead editor's record is eight front-page articles in a year.

120
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,520
   

121
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,089
Don't drink coffee. Don't you want to get better?

122
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,530
Drink this.

123
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:51,570
I wonder why Mingyu Cloud Innovation changed the interviewer.

124
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,947
It shows that their boss has good taste.

125
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:55,746
Are you talking about Shi Yan?

126
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:58,330
I think Shi Yan has good taste.

127
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,009
Otherwise, he wouldn't have made the company so strong in just a few years.

128
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,420
But he is a weirdo.

129
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,190
In Mingyuâ€™s most difficult time, he left his familyâ€™s company alone

130
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,697
and insisted on going out to start a new company.

131
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:15,530
What do you think he was thinking?

132
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,538
A lot of people out there are saying bad things about him.

133
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:21,330
That he's the runaway successor of Mingyu.

134
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,307
That he's a coward.

135
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:29,149
And his girlfriend, the actress Bei Lin broke up with him immediately.

136
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:32,570
I think he's quite brave.

137
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,690
Although he was questioned, he still chose this path.

138
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,949
How much courage does it take?

139
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,680
   

140
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:17,263
It will be a pleasure to work with Lieying.

141
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:18,353
We are honored, Director Feng.

142
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:19,890
- We are partners. 
 - Yes.

143
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,861
That's right. We've been partners for years.

144
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,809
Right.

145
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:28,216
Mr. Shi.

146
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,127
Please grab me two cold cokes.

147
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:31,983
Okay.

148
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,409
I'm writing an interview for Lieying.

149
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:41,690
I heard that Mingyu Cloud Innovation was going to invest in Lieying.

150
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,310
You must know Lieying, right?

151
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,205
It has been strong in recent years.

152
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:47,750
Many companies want to invest in it.

153
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,968
There are no clear photos of Shi Yan on the internet.

154
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,606
After he started his business, he kept a low profile.

155
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:57,589
He has never met the press.

156
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,944
If I could record an exclusive video or audio for him,

157
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,389
it would attract many subscribers.

158
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:10,050
You are still thinking about upgrading the e-journal?

159
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,033
Financial information is relevant to everyone.

160
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:16,575
If we don't upgrade it, and keep publishing the same content as the paper magazine,

161
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:21,129
we can't interact with the subscribers and we will lose them.

162
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,890
It makes sense.

163
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,532
But we don't have the people or the money to upgrade it.

164
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:34,292
Even if you convince the lead editor, he will ask you questions, like,

165
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,409
"What about the people? What do we do?"

166
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,829
"Where do we get the money?"

167
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:39,329
I will do it.

168
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,630
I want to show the leaders that I can lead the upgrade of the e-journal.

169
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,129
Then through content monetization, meet the human and financial resources

170
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:49,209
required for the new e-journal.

171
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,749
Good for you. Go for it.

172
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:54,109
I fully support you.

173
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,272
 Come to visit us when you are free. 

174
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,789
No problem.

175
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,824
- Mr. Shi. 
 - Mr. Shi.

176
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:12,953
It's cold coke.

177
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,769
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

178
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:20,429
Well, I read your updated information and data on my way here.

179
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,560
It's going great.

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,549
Yes. We finished that last night.

181
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,871
Lili, take Mr. Chen to the meeting room and take care of him.

182
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,049
Okay, Mr. Shi. Mr. Chen, this way, please.

183
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:40,631
Mr. Shi.

184
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:46,769
Shi, if you have any requirements, just ask.

185
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,789
We've been partners with Mingyu Group for years.

186
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:55,310
And we had business with your father before.

187
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,674
However, the situation was special.

188
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:01,570
Anyway, we will help you.

189
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,849
I'm sure we'll have a good cooperation.

190
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,582
Mr. Shi, do you have any questions?

191
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:14,849
Thank you.

192
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:17,015
I've learned about Lieying.

193
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:22,270
I am interested in where the company is headed.

194
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,212
Our company ranks among the top in the industry.

195
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:33,409
Le'an Technology is just a supplier of our company.

196
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:35,669
It has nothing to do with the rank.

197
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:38,070
According to the information,

198
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,192
the purpose of your company is to serve a wider public.

199
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:45,369
You have to further improve your technology.

200
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:48,430
So far, there's no solutions for that.

201
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,210
Mr. Shi, look.

202
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,970
Lieying is an established company.

203
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,870
Investing in it will help us enter the industry quickly.

204
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,572
And Lieying and Mingyu Group are partners.

205
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,489
We've been through adversity together.

206
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:05,970
Yes.

207
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,349
I totally understand.

208
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,970
My father values Lieying.

209
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,950
But this is business.

210
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,093
The essence of investing is to buy future value.

211
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:18,946
If Lieying wants to cooperate with Mingyu Cloud Innovation,

212
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:22,609
you should come up with solutions to improve core technologies.

213
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:26,590
We are an investment company, not a charity.

214
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,410
Am I right?

215
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,249
Thank you for your time.

216
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,609
Director Feng, please see Mr. Li out.

217
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:44,490
Mr. Li.

218
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,889
Mr. Li.

219
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,256
- Mr. Li. 
 - Mr. Chen, please.

220
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,138
It takes time to solve technical challenges.

221
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:12,443
Once solved, it will revolutionize the domestic chip.

222
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:15,987
You should work hard, to create our own patent.

223
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:17,450
I believe in you.

224
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,110
Mingyu Cloud Innovation will do its best to support you.

225
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,609
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

226
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:24,157
If we can get the R&amp;D funding,

227
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:26,870
I'm sure we will achieve a phased breakthrough.

228
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,802
I will visit Le'an Technology tomorrow. We will talk about it.

229
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,649
Okay, then I'll take my leave.

230
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:40,929
Mr. Shi, let me get this straight.

231
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:44,970
Lieying's Mr. Li is a friend of Mr. Shi and Mr. Tian.

232
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,489
If you insist on investing in Le'an,

233
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:51,629
I'm afraid you won't be able to convince the board.

234
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,129
Interviews are the most basic part of investing.

235
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:57,129
If you can't schedule an interview well,

236
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,690
I can't trust your judgment on investments.

237
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,309
Mingyu Cloud Innovation wants to invest in the future, not relationships.

238
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:16,090
Mr. Tian, Mr. Shi showed up during the interview.

239
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,729
Mr. Shi.

240
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,636
 Uncle, you said you were going to pick me up. 

241
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:27,927
Something has come up.

242
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,092
 Uncle, you don't love me. 

243
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,330
Mr. Shi.

244
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,789
I have to go.

245
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,443
I sent Ms. Qin there.

246
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:38,203
She's been complaining that you didn't pick her up yourself.

247
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,850
She wanted me to pass that.

248
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,269
Anything else?

249
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:44,614
Yes. Mr. Guan said he couldn't reach you.

250
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:45,729
What does he want?

251
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,889
He's hosting a banquet at Warner Manor.

252
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:50,018
He wanted you to attend it.

253
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,629
I am not available.

254
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,369
Mr. Guan knew you would say that.

255
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,769
He wanted to introduce you to someone important.

256
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,454
   

257
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,386
Okay. Tell him that I will attend it.

258
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:16,529
What about the Financial Introduce interview?

259
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,470
Explain the situation, and reschedule it.

260
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,610
Okay, I will go.

261
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:34,182
   

262
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,209
 Dear, you're not going to work overtime. Right? 

263
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,050
Xingzhou,

264
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,930
remember I told you about Shi Yan's interview?

265
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,609
The editor-in-chief just informed me

266
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:49,709
that he wanted me to do the interview.

267
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,489
 But I only have one birthday a year. 

268
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:53,369
I am sorry, Xingzhou.

269
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,129
I've been preparing for Shi Yan's interview for two months.

270
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,290
The opportunity is rare.

271
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,729
Shi Yan asked me to interview him.

272
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:03,589
If I don't go, the front page of the next issue will be blank.

273
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,070
You know, he has lots of stories.

274
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,590
He has not been interviewed since he founded Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

275
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,830
This is the first exclusive interview.

276
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,510
 Okay. Let's celebrate it later. 

277
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,249
 I will wait for you after work. 

278
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:20,769
I am sorry, Xingzhou.

279
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,749
It's too sudden.

280
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:24,529
 It's fine. I can understand it. 

281
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,050
 You've been working hard for this interview. 

282
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,170
 Hold on to it. 

283
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,009
Thank you, Xingzhou.

284
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,264
You are the best.

285
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:35,970
The interview starts at 7:00.

286
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,683
I will try to finish it in two hours.

287
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:42,290
We'll still have time to blow out the candles, make wishes, and eat birthday cake.

288
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,269
 I will pick you up after the interview. 

289
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,529
I'll text you the address later.

290
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,170
It's so nice of you.

291
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,790
Is your boyfriend cool with it?

292
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,846
Yes. He said he understood it.

293
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,190
And he wanted to pick me up.

294
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,009
Your boyfriend is really too reasonable.

295
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,729
Not like the clingy one in my family.

296
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:15,489
Whatever reason I ditch him, he gets mad.

297
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:18,670
See you.

298
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,070
 Hello, Ms. Zheng, I am Chen Sheng from Mingyu Cloud Innovation. 

299
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,710
Hello, Mr. Chen.

300
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,250
Ms. Zheng, for some reason, Mr. Shi needs to cancel the interview.

301
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,330
We will reschedule it.

302
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,729
 I am sorry. 

303
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,210
When is the interview rescheduled?

304
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,324
 A week later at the same time. Is that okay? 

305
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,961
 Or when you have time in a week? 

306
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,920
If the interview is rescheduled for next week,

307
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,310
we won't have anything to cover in the next issue.

308
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,453
Can Mr. Shi spare me a few minutes?

309
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:59,044
No matter what time of day.

310
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:01,009
We can split it into two interviews.

311
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,608
I am afraid it won't work.

312
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,509
 Mr. Shi's schedule is full these days. 

313
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:08,650
Thenâ€¦

314
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,529
Could he spare me two hours tonight?

315
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,350
Or one hour.

316
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,430
He has plans tonight. He has no time for you.

317
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,769
 I am sorry. 

318
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,370
No.

319
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:34,409
Dear Shanshan, could you find out where Shi Yan is going tonight?

320
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,769
Hello.

321
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,769
 Shi Yan? 

322
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,652
 I don't know him. 

323
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,370
 But you're a lucky dog. 

324
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,030
 Guan Ji, Shi Yan's friend, 

325
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,809
 is going to host a banquet at Warner Manor. 

326
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:07,930
 I think half of the Guan friends in Jiangcheng will attend it. 

327
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,930
 I don't know if Shi Yan is going. 

328
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,727
I will take a shot.

329
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:13,890
 Wait. 

330
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,870
 Aren't you going to celebrate Yue Xingzhou's birthday? 

331
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,469
 Are you going to ditch him? 

332
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,890
My boyfriend and Shi Yan, I choose Shi Yan.

333
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,144
 Good. 

334
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:27,270
 Enterprising women are the most attractive. 

335
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,989
Thank you.

336
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,790
Warner Manor.

337
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:00,319
Enjoy.

338
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,185
Come to me.

339
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,914
Mr. Chen, good evening.

340
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:33,522
I arrived at Warner Manor.

341
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:36,049
 Ms. Zheng, whyâ€¦ 

342
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:38,830
Sorry to just come over here.

343
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,409
I don't have much time.

344
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,950
Please tell Mr. Shi that I will wait for him.

345
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,698
I hope he can feel my sincerity and spare me some minutes for the interview.

346
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:51,050
Well. Please find a place to wait.

347
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,249
I'm going to talk to Mr. Shi.

348
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,489
 I can't promise you anything. 

349
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:58,189
 You may have come for nothing. 

350
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:01,801
Okay. Thank you anyway.

351
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:10,830
I think Guan Ji is throwing the banquet to get everyone together for dinner.

352
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,909
I don't think so.

353
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:17,129
I heard that Yu You was specially invited by the Guans from abroad.

354
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,970
He is a professor at the University of Finance and Economics.

355
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,910
Only the Guans can hire him as a consultant.

356
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,729
Mr. Shi was also invited.

357
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:26,489
Shi Wenguang's son is no good.

358
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:29,549
Mingyu Group was in trouble, but he started his own company.

359
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:34,329
So Shi Wenguang handed over the company to his son-in-law. What a shame.

360
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:38,109
In my opinion, Guan's son and Shi's son are ambitious.

361
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:39,690
They hired a professor from abroad.

362
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,570
I think they'll accomplish something.

363
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,569
One is timid, the other is playful.

364
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,829
What can they accomplish?

365
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:49,150
Funny. Let's go.

366
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,850
Is Guan Ji going to be late again?

367
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,410
Mr. Guan said there was a traffic jam.

368
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,389
He will be here in 10 minutes.

369
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,929
Anything else?

370
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:45,850
Ms. Zheng from Financial Introduce is here.

371
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,650
She is waiting for you.

372
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,210
She wanted you to space some time for the interview.

373
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,170
Zheng Shuyi?

374
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,009
I told you to ask her to reschedule it.

375
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,810
I did. But she said if she rescheduled the interview,

376
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,470
they won't have anything to cover in the next issue.

377
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,170
I don't know how she knew about your plans.

378
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,729
I have a meeting with Le'an Technology tomorrow.

379
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:10,450
I don't have time for the interview tonight.

380
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,070
It's remote. I don't think she ate.

381
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,689
Grab her some food and get a car for her. There's no taxi here.

382
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,589
Okay.

383
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:21,130
Graduated with a full scholarship from Harvard. 
    

384
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,829
Double Ph.D. in Economics and Finance, University of Cambridge.

385
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,049
The youngest professor to be at the University of Finance and Economics.

386
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,189
Nice resume.

387
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,970
- Thank you. 
 - My pleasure.

388
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,550
Are you Professor Yu You?

389
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,430
Do you know me?

390
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,089
I am reading your research.

391
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,960
Fintech. Technology-driven financial innovation

392
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,970
isn't just macroeconomic,

393
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,430
it can also bring profound changes to each of our lives.

394
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,856
I feel close to the field.

395
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:20,769
It is closely related to our lives.

396
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,150
You are right. That's why I chose this research direction.

397
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,832
In the past, "Capital" and "Finance" were out of reach.

398
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,700
But now I study them

399
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,190
to see how much they can transform our lives.

400
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,929
If I had the chance, I would like to return to my alma mater and listen to your lectures.

401
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,189
You graduated from the University of Finance and Economics?

402
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:45,730
Yes. I am a reporter at Financial Introduce.

403
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:48,130
Professor Yu, can I add you on WeChat?

404
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,525
- Mr. Shi. 
 - Of course.

405
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:51,690
- I'll scan your QR code. 
 - Okay.

406
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,589
That is Zheng Shuyi from Financial Introduce.

407
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:57,049
Okay.

408
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,829
Zheng Shuyi. I'll remark you as Reporter Zheng.

409
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:05,976
Thank you.

410
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,390
Zheng Shuyi.

411
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,930
 The winner of the Interviewer of the Year, 

412
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,609
 writer of Zhu Xingguo on Currency Wars, Zheng Shuyi. 

413
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:50,189
I am sorry. I am late.

414
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:53,410
Guan Ji. It's been a long time since you came to ride horses with me.

415
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,990
My bad.

416
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,310
I heard you went to Qionghai. I was waiting for you to come back.

417
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,709
I am back.

418
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:01,930
I'll wait for you at the racecourse tomorrow.

419
00:27:04,311 --> 00:27:09,069
As far as I know, tonight's banquet is closed to the press.

420
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:12,763
I know. I'm here to wait for an interviewee.

421
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,509
Work is important, and so is health.

422
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:22,130
You don't look well.

423
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:25,310
I am fine. I'll be fine with my medicine.

424
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,134
See you in there.

425
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,970
- I will see you later. 
 - Okay.

426
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,310
Let's go.

427
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:07,389
Mr. Shi.

428
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,689
Sorry, Ms. Zheng. Mr. Shi is not available tonight.

429
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:16,289
I'll find the closest time to finish the interview.

430
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,170
You didn't eat, right?

431
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,189
You should eat something first. Then I will get a car to send you back.

432
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:24,870
It's okay. My friend will pick me up.

433
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,929
So close.

434
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:35,009
At least let me see your face.

435
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,210
- Long time. 
 - Mr. Zhang, long time no see.

436
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,110
Long time no see.

437
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,606
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you.

438
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:41,588
- Long time no see. 
 - Long time no see.

439
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,249
Mr. Wang, how are you doing?

440
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:54,329
Hello, Professor Yu. Welcome back.

441
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:56,589
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shi. Thank you.

442
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,909
I've read your article.

443
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:03,310
Research on the Impact of Financial Constraints on the Investment and Financing Behavior of Listed Companies.

444
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,809
Your opinion is different from that at home.

445
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,329
The article was written last year.

446
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,769
It's a little long.

447
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:11,289
I have some new ideas this year.

448
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:13,089
It's good to embrace changes.

449
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,009
I'm glad that Guan Ji brought you back.

450
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:18,389
There should be plenty of opportunities to consult you with in the future.

451
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,690
I am flattered.

452
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,569
Mingyu Cloud Innovation has a bright future.

453
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,550
We will learn from each other.

454
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:32,550
Well, I read an article called Zhu Xingguo on Currency Wars.

455
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,229
Its view is sharp, and its content is sensitive.

456
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:36,610
It's very stimulating to me.

457
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,030
You should read it when you are free.

458
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,109
I have an impression of this article.

459
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:43,669
It's not bad.

460
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:45,249
Cheers.

461
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:48,909
Guys, let me say few words.

462
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:52,870
All of you here today are friends of Guan Capital.

463
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,580
The new year's coming,  I am hosting this banquet

464
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,470
to thank you all for your cooperation.

465
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:03,030
And I want to introduce you to a new friend.

466
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:07,850
The strategy consultant of Guan Group, Professor of Finance, Mr. Yu You.

467
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:17,510
- Thank you. 
  - Cheers. 

468
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,556
Enjoy yourselves.

469
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,289
- Let me introduceâ€¦ 
 - No need.

470
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:38,324
Yu You, he's wanted to see you for a long time.

471
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:41,750
You're not even so interested in a girl.

472
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:44,529
I am flattered, Mr. Shi.

473
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,289
Okay, I've finished my mission.

474
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:50,049
Here's the man you wanted to meet.

475
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,850
My old man supports us.

476
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:57,009
Now we have to convince the fogies of Mingyu Cloud Innovation.

477
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:59,289
About your father, do youâ€¦

478
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:02,130
Don't rush. One step at a time.

479
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,829
Right.

480
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,709
We are three lameâ€¦

481
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,030
You are the lamest.

482
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,676
Fine. We are three musketeers in Jiangcheng.

483
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:17,389
All for one and one for all.

484
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:19,849
Cheers.

485
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,329
Xingzhou, where are you?

486
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,140
 The traffic is heavy. Wait for me for a while. 

487
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,749
 I'll be there as soon as possible. 

488
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:56,289
Okay. I'll wait for you on the side of the road in case you can't see me.

489
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,809
Ms. Zheng, long time no see.

490
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:11,835
What are you doing here?

491
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:13,989
Long time, Mr. Zhang.

492
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:16,248
I'm here for an interview.

493
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:20,350
The interview you wrote for me was great.

494
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,450
I haven't had time to thank you.

495
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,019
Get in the car. I'll give you a ride.

496
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,389
I am flattered.

497
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:28,190
You are a veteran in the industry, so I have room to play.

498
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,569
My boyfriend will be here in a minute.

499
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:30,930
Thank you.

500
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,729
Okay, see you.

501
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,430
Miss, are you alone?

502
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,030
Do you need a ride?

503
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,125
It's raining hard.

504
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,670
No, thank you. My boyfriend will be here in a minute.

505
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,650
Then, why are you standing here?

506
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,750
It has nothing to do with you.

507
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:02,267
Why is Ms. Zheng still here?

508
00:33:06,543 --> 00:33:09,529
Didn't I tell you to get a car for her?

509
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,090
She said her boyfriend would pick her up.

510
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,870
Xingzhou, when will you get here?

511
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,781
I am so cold.

512
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,970
Did her boyfriend ditch her?

513
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,025
This time, this road, and it's raining.

514
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:13,770
I don't think she can get a taxi.

515
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:16,070
Drive the car over.

516
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:22,709
I know it's raining, but I am waiting for my boyfriend.

517
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:26,070
Right, I have a boyfriend. Take care. Thank you.

518
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,470
No way.

519
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,049
Let's go.

520
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:58,049
She is waiting for her boyfriend.

521
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:01,970
I didn't know she really had a boyfriend.

522
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,709
I talked to her a few times today.

523
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:07,170
I think she is nice.

524
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,550
She didn't get to interview you.

525
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,210
And people were hitting on her.

526
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,709
And it's cold.

527
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:17,149
I think that's why she was acting so impatient.

528
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,909
You seem to care if she has a boyfriend.

529
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,089
No.

530
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:26,929
She's pretty and capable.

531
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:30,489
It's normal for her to have a boyfriend.

532
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:34,770
You think she's pretty and capable?

533
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,929
Yes. Her colleagues think highly of her.

534
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:41,389
They thought she could be a deputy editor.

535
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:46,109
- Chen Sheng, I noticed one thing. 
 - What thing?

536
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,170
You're better suited to be a gossip reporter than my assistant.

537
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:12,370
I am sorry, Shuyi. It's hard to drive in the heavy rain.

538
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,870
There was another traffic jam before I got there. You must be freezing.

539
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,670
I am fine.

540
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,630
How was your birthday? Were you happy?

541
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,864
How could I be happy without my girlfriend?

542
00:36:24,864 --> 00:36:26,770
I am sorry.

543
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,470
Who spent your birthday with you?

544
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,710
Who else?

545
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,429
Xu Feng?

546
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:40,709
He started wearing perfume?

547
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,970
The perfume is light and special.

548
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,330
His taste is good.

549
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,789
Next time you meet him, ask him what perfume he wears.

550
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:52,509
I think it will smell great on you, too.

551
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:55,049
How was your interview?

552
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:57,989
It's a long story.

553
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:01,089
Never mind. Let's change the subject.

554
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:03,770
Okay. Don't be upset, dear.

555
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,749
Why don't you answer that?

556
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,529
I am off work. I want to focus on you.

557
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:18,609
I don't answer calls for work.

558
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,770
Let's go to my place.

559
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,329
I will make longevity noodles for you.

560
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,809
No, thanks. It's late. And you don't feel good.

561
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:30,610
Rest early. You will have plenty of chances to make it up to me.

562
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,330
You are so nice.

563
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,423
That's because I love you. My little fool.

564
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,529
Your birthday isn't over yet.

565
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:55,830
Happy birthday, Xingzhou.

566
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,649
Thank you, baby.

567
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:01,190
I will leave.

568
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,709
Hello, what's up?

569
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:28,129
What?

570
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,129
I will tell the chief editor about it.

571
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,272
Where is my phone?

572
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:28,290
Hospital?

573
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,189
Why is it in the hospital?

574
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,649
Was it stolen?

575
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,709
I got in the car with it in my hand.

576
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:43,189
Why did Xingzhou go to the hospital?

577
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:45,229
Is he sick?

578
00:39:46,194 --> 00:39:49,830
Did he get into a car accident?

579
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,010
   

580
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,570
He is here.

581
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,850
Plate with same numbers.

582
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,089
It must belong to a big shot.

583
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:53,850
It must be his friend.

584
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,909
It's not unusual to visit a friend in the hospital at night.
