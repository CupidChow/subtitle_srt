1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,047
BASED ON THE WEBTOON SERIES

2
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,737
THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

3
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,414
Shut up!

4
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,583
Shut up! Just shut up!

5
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,585
Shut up! Just shut up!

6
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,879
-Shut up?
-On live TV?

7
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,299
Just shut up!

8
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,681
Oh dear.

9
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,519
Dear me.

10
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,229
Just shut up!

11
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,065
He wanted to make his TV debut,
and he got his wish.

12
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,527
He's not photogenic at all.

13
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,444
Just shut up!

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,988
DR. BAEK KANG-HYUK OF HNUH
TV INTERVIEW DRAMA

15
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,031
Damn it.

16
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,246
I didn't expect this turn of events.

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,420
I wish I could have been there
to see the look on Kang's face!

18
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,715
The press is having a field day.

19
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,552
Oh well.

20
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,346
The crony she brought in so ambitiously

21
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,682
has revealed his ugly side.

22
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,853
It's not all sunshine and rainbows.

23
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,191
It's all well and good for Baek Kang-hyuk
to fall flat on his own,

24
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,360
but just look at the mess he's made.

25
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,113
This hospital has a reputation to uphold.

26
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,282
And now he's thrown mud all over us!

27
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,162
Plus, he sent me an email asking
for a budget increase for trauma surgery.

28
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,789
-An email?
-Yes!

29
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,166
And guess what he said.

30
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,587
If the hospital can't afford it,
then he'll contact the minister directly.

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,839
He's throwing me under the bus!

32
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,132
I can't believe what…

33
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,510
What a cocky little…

34
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,345
I am upset. Very upset.

35
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,556
Minister Kang always coddles
and defends him.

36
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,975
We don't have a valid reason
to kick him out.

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
You will do something about him,
won't you?

38
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,607
Let's just wait for the right opportunity.

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,276
If he keeps running wild like that,

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,279
he's bound to screw up sooner or later.

41
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,742
Director Choi.

42
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,493
I've got bad news.

43
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,916
Black Wings.

44
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,047
"Black Wings."

45
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,590
BLACK WINGS
PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY

46
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,842
"The world's largest
private military company."

47
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,221
"Specializes in VIP protection
in conflict zones."

48
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,973
"Conducts combat and rescue missions."

49
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,227
"Outmatches special forces
in combat power."

50
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,895
"Due to their high-risk nature,

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,857
all missions must be accompanied
by medics."

52
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,443
"Even those medics

53
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,239
are known as human weapons."

54
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,000
"Personal firearms, close combat…"

55
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,960
Wow.

56
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,256
This is no joke.

57
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,722
Hey, No. 1.

58
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,058
Yes! No. 1, Yang Jae-won reporting, sir!

59
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,393
What are you up to?

60
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,894
I wasn't doing anything, sir.

61
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,229
You weren't?

62
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,563
How come?

63
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,275
You should be checking
the ICU patients' vitals and I/Os

64
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,318
on top of studying the papers I gave you.

65
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,320
Why are you holed up in here?

66
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,405
You're wasting time

67
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,074
looking up this useless damn stuff.

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,493
I won't do it again, sir.

69
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,828
Come on.

70
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,371
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Do better.

71
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,081
Let's not stress each other out.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,045
By the way, Dr. Baek,

73
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,465
I'm curious about something.

74
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,467
I genuinely have no other intention.

75
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,553
I'm asking purely out of curiosity.

76
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,512
What is it?

77
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:09,434
The International Medical Association
For Peace was where you were at first.

78
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,270
Then you suddenly moved to Black Wings.

79
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,522
I don't quite get how that happened.

80
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,193
You stepped into greater danger

81
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,404
as you'd find more trauma patients there.

82
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,197
-That must be why.
-To make money.

83
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,116
Pardon?

84
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,160
It's just that
they offered to pay me a lot.

85
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,916
Code Black. All emergency medicine
and Trauma Center medics.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,627
-What on earth? Seriously?
-To the ER, please.

87
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,130
-It's a disaster protocol.
-Run.

88
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,674
All emergency medicine
and Trauma Center medics.

89
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,265
-Doctor!
-Gangster, what happened?

90
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,602
There's a 60-vehicle pile-up
on Sowol Bridge.

91
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,437
The fog has made it much worse.

92
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:59,484
Most vehicles, including two tour buses,
are getting help on the bridge.

93
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,653
But four vehicles, including one bus,
have fallen off the bridge.

94
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,784
Ambulances are arriving as we speak.
Please hurry.

95
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,330
I think there will be
many serious injuries.

96
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,416
We must hurry.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,169
Tertiary hospitals like ours
will be swamped with patients.

98
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,172
Transporting patients
to smaller hospitals could be fatal.

99
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,465
Got it? Hurry!

100
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,551
This way. Quickly!

101
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,095
Over here!

102
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,596
Hurry to the treatment room!

103
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,555
Speed up!

104
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,350
-Coming through!
-Let us pass, please.

105
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,227
This way! Hurry!

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,395
Please let us pass!

107
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,480
Coming through.

108
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,773
Just a moment.

109
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,900
Stay with me.

110
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,694
-Wait.
-This way, please.

111
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,612
Okay.

112
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,072
Quickly.

113
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,199
-Intubate and insert a C-line.
-Yes, Doctor.

114
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,452
Secure as many ORs as possible.

115
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,370
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,914
Keep your eyes closed.

117
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,040
Call them quickly!

118
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,042
-Hello.
-Gangster.

119
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,085
Call all residents.

120
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,546
The entire ER is on deck.

121
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,964
I mean, from all departments.

122
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,216
-Especially the surgical departments.
-Okay.

123
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,926
Dr. Kim, this way!

124
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,303
Straight up to the lab.

125
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,555
Stay with me.

126
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,807
Call orthopedics, please!

127
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,851
Dr. Baek.

128
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,770
Mr. An is transporting a patient
by helicopter right now.

129
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,527
One, two, three.

130
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,529
Lift.

131
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,242
Luckily, it's not an open wound. Gangster!

132
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,327
-Notify orthopedics.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,582
-What are you doing?
-Can you get in touch with Mr. An?

134
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,169
What are you doing?
We should go with the patient!

135
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,588
Mr. An, this is Baek Kang-hyuk.
Can you hear me?

136
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,048
Mr. An. Can't you hear me?

137
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,469
Mr. An. It's Baek Kang-hyuk here!

138
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,763
Is that you, Dr. Baek?
The situation here is intense.

139
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,602
I heard about the vehicles
that fell off the bridge.

140
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,103
Has the rescue begun there?

141
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,356
No, we haven't even made a start
under the bridge.

142
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:07,153
We're having trouble gaining access,
so we're preparing to rappel down.

143
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,157
All right.

144
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,410
Wait, Dr. Baek. We should--

145
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,995
-We're heading to the site.
-What?

146
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,498
That's where we'll find
critically injured patients.

147
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,917
But Dr. Baek!

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,834
Wait.

149
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,794
But…

150
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,009
At 7:40 this morning on Sowol Bridge…

151
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,721
The ER can handle
up to 40 patients at a time.

152
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,973
As of now, we are treating 38 patients,

153
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,352
who will be transferred
to relevant departments after triage.

154
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
All right.

155
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,524
Dr. Im. Emergency medicine
must rise to the occasion this time.

156
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,069
We must admit as many patients as possible
at the outset.

157
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,987
That will help save the day quickly.

158
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,869
That took a load off.

159
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,122
I was worried they'd bring in
all the seriously injured.

160
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,833
Imagine how much money
we would've poured in. Damn.

161
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,503
-We could've suffered a loss.
-Chief.

162
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,921
Watch your language.

163
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,674
If someone overheard us,

164
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,302
they'd think I called
the disaster code for money

165
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,263
to avoid accepting trauma patients.

166
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,808
Not at all, sir. That's not what I meant.

167
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,354
Such a major accident
draws significant media attention,

168
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,939
so we should be cautious.

169
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,066
Just imagine that brat Baek Kang-hyuk

170
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,319
running loose and making a fuss
about saving those trauma patients.

171
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,446
His success would bring him
personal glory.

172
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,658
One slipup and there would be
a fatality at this hospital.

173
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,494
We should nip such misfortunes in the bud.

174
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,372
-Don't you agree, Dr. Im?
-Yes, Chief.

175
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,584
Dr. Baek is not here right now.

176
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,501
Exactly.

177
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,296
What? He's not here?

178
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,340
He should be with patients.
Where did he go?

179
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,010
Yes, I certainly told him as much.

180
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,722
But he said the ER should be able
to handle this much--

181
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,557
So where on earth is he?!

182
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,601
He's gone to the accident site.

183
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,107
Is he going to personally escort
the trauma patients here?

184
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,994
Dr. Baek. We're here now.

185
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,413
Should we land on the bridge?

186
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,666
Or should we head down under the bridge?

187
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,170
Captain.

188
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,505
-Let's head down.
-Yes, Doctor.

189
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,599
Come this way!

190
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,516
Hurry!

191
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,023
Don't move!

192
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,832
Where do we stand?

193
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,419
Thankfully, we've cleared a path,
and ambulances are starting to arrive.

194
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,672
We'll transport rescued victims
immediately.

195
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,174
No. We need to do a triage first.

196
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,593
-Please gather all the victims together.
-Okay.

197
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,096
Should I start treating them?

198
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,473
We're not here to treat them.
Our job is to triage.

199
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,892
No one here is authorized
to declare anyone dead.

200
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,686
We must separate those we can save

201
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,479
from those we can't.

202
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,357
You start by triaging
the conscious patients.

203
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,525
What about you?

204
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,987
I'll start with the fatalities.

205
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,989
Stay sharp.

206
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,200
Okay.

207
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,341
-Three, two, three.
-Please help.

208
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,884
One, two, three, four.

209
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,387
All right.

210
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,182
From now on,
all victims must be seen by us first.

211
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,644
You must never take them directly
to an ambulance.

212
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,814
Please move
all conscious patients to my right

213
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,525
and unconscious patients to my left.

214
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,235
That includes the dead.

215
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,696
-Let's move quickly.
-Yes, sir!

216
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,947
-Two, three, four.
-Sir.

217
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,158
-Move them here. Separate the patients.
-Okay!

218
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,617
Is there a defibrillator?

219
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,077
Yes. Over here.

220
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,335
You can stop now.

221
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,838
He's dead.

222
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,511
We don't have time to waste.

223
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,514
You should quickly move on
to other patients.

224
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,933
Right.

225
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,605
Some help over here!

226
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,776
Move the patients over here.

227
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,778
UNKNOWN MALE
CONDITION: DECEASED

228
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,746
One, two, three, four.

229
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,210
This way! Quickly!

230
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,879
Put them down over here.

231
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,139
We need to come up with a plan.

232
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,815
Madam, Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk
is triaging patients on site.

233
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,316
-Dr. Baek?
-Yes, ma'am.

234
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,361
60-VEHICLE PILE-UP ON SOWOL BRIDGE
HEAVY CASUALTIES

235
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,822
My brother!

236
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,615
It's all right.

237
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,742
UNKNOWN FEMALE
CONDITION: NON-EMERGENCY

238
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,119
Where is my brother?

239
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,665
It hurts.

240
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,379
My brother held me tight

241
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,423
when we fell.

242
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:06,262
All right.
I will make sure I save your brother.

243
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,264
So hang in there for a bit.

244
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,015
Okay.

245
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,269
Hurry. This way.

246
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,104
We got them all. Quickly.

247
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,188
Dr. Baek!

248
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,731
Please take a look.

249
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,613
We have a pulse and breathing,
but he is unconscious.

250
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,783
He was likely impaled by a broken pipe
as he fell.

251
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,494
Due to severe bleeding,
we left the pipe in situ.

252
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,495
Good work.

253
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,621
Please help.

254
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,998
Bring me a suture kit.

255
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,457
-Use size two thread.
-Okay.

256
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,917
Move aside. Coming through!

257
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,545
-Here you go.
-Hold on.

258
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,551
I'll bring it with me!

259
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,848
Dr. Baek, isn't that suture too deep?

260
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,018
We need to stop the bleeding first.
Can't you tell at first glance?

261
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,479
You must know
how to treat a penetrating wound.

262
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,273
Make a median incision.

263
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,108
First control the bleeding.

264
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,776
Then remove this.

265
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,194
Yes, sir.

266
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,197
Wait. Me?

267
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,283
Take him by helicopter
and go into surgery.

268
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,410
I'll catch up once I finish triaging.

269
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,706
Can't I do the triaging, Dr. Baek?

270
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,378
Can you tell at one glance
who will live and who will die?

271
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,256
But I'm just not confident, Dr. Baek.

272
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,716
I am confident.

273
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,385
Trust my faith in you. Do you trust me?

274
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,432
-Are you all right?
-Move the patient here.

275
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,975
This patient can make it.

276
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,436
Go and make sure you save him.

277
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,520
All right?

278
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,023
Right.

279
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,359
Yes, sir.

280
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,211
All right. Careful, Nurse Cheon.

281
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,881
Nurse Cheon. Is the OR ready?

282
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,716
They're on standby. Where is Dr. Baek?

283
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,260
Still out there.
He said to start the surgery.

284
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,720
Let's get going!

285
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,069
I am confident.

286
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,197
Trust my faith in you. Do you trust me?

287
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,337
First make a median incision.

288
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,880
Get the bleeding under control.

289
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,549
And then blood pressure…

290
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,508
I can do this.

291
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,635
Doctor.

292
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,303
Pull yourself together.

293
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,931
You're the lead surgeon here.

294
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,684
If you falter, so will everyone else.

295
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,528
I will now

296
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,613
begin the surgery.

297
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,907
Scalpel.

298
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:22,875
NAME: LEE CHANG-HUN, GENDER: MALE
PENETRATING WOUND

299
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,887
UNKNOWN FEMALE
CONDITION: IMMEDIATE

300
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,306
It's an open fracture, so be careful.

301
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,640
Yes, Doctor.

302
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,647
This is a painkiller.
You'll feel better shortly.

303
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,571
Dr. Baek.
I found this among her belongings.

304
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,575
I believe she has diabetes,
considering she carries insulin with her.

305
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,577
What do we do?

306
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,418
-She must be transported immediately.
-Which hospital should we go to?

307
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,506
-Hankuk National University Hospital.
-Okay.

308
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,637
Doctor.

309
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,766
I think you should take a look
at this patient.

310
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,312
He's the last survivor.

311
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,731
The ones you've assessed
are being transported.

312
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,614
The bleeding is so severe.
Does he stand a chance?

313
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,161
My brother.

314
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,540
Please save my brother.

315
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,291
My brother!

316
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:52,339
NAME: CHO SEOK-JUN, GENDER: MALE
CONDITION: IMMEDIATE

317
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,425
We're taking the open fracture patient
to Hankuk Hospital now.

318
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,969
Are you coming with us?

319
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,474
Dr. Baek, shouldn't you operate
on the one with a better chance?

320
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,393
-We can take him to another--
-No.

321
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,478
I'm his only hope.

322
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,441
Then what about that other patient?

323
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,654
And the one that was flown to HNUH
was also in serious condition.

324
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,210
We'll take him to HNUH too.

325
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,298
I must save all three patients.

326
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,220
That smells delicious.

327
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,683
I'm done eating. I'm full.

328
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,644
Come on. We can't let this go to waste.

329
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,354
It'll help your bones heal. Wait.

330
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,398
JERK DOCTOR BAEK KANG-HYUK

331
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,275
Who do we have here?

332
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,611
Our dear savior, Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.

333
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,529
I need help with an open fracture.

334
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,655
Help?

335
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,034
I'm not sure who's available right now.

336
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,785
Can you call an orthopedic surgeon?

337
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,495
I think he's in the OR. A resident--

338
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,914
No. A resident won't cut it.

339
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,916
Who else should I contact, then?

340
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,001
-An attending!
-Let me think.

341
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,170
This is really serious.
Please do me a favor.

342
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,630
All right, then.

343
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,257
-I get it.
-One more thing.

344
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,176
-Get ready to perform surgery.
-Who?

345
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,510
Me?

346
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,887
We need you in the OR.

347
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,847
I'm a colorectal surgeon.

348
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,724
I put down my scalpel ages ago.

349
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,226
I'm not kidding right now.

350
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,144
Just hurry up and get ready.

351
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,981
Hey, Dr. Baek.

352
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,069
For God's sake.

353
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,112
He always hangs up on me.

354
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,406
-Dad.
-Yes?

355
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,324
What is it?

356
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:44,910
It's just that

357
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,497
he wants me in the OR
because they're shorthanded.

358
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,539
Yes?

359
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,250
But I'm not sure I belong there.

360
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,709
I'm all for it.

361
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,586
I only went to med school

362
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,297
because you looked so cool
with a scalpel in your hand.

363
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,968
Really?

364
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,888
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

365
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,931
Are you done?

366
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,142
-I told you I wouldn't do it.
-Come on, don't be like that.

367
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,479
I haven't eaten all day.
Do you know how many surgeries I've done?

368
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,064
Come on!

369
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,525
Of course I know. But please.

370
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,652
We need to save the patient.

371
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,445
The patient has an open fracture.

372
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,364
You're the only one who can save her.

373
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,408
Please? Help me out here. Okay?

374
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,118
Come quick. I'll meet you there.

375
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,621
What has gotten into him?

376
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,044
This is anesthesiology.

377
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,965
Hey. What is it?

378
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,341
Emergency surgery.

379
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,467
Say I'm not here.

380
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,927
-Be quiet.
-Say I'm not here.

381
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,056
That's too bad. Our books are full,
and there are so many surgeries today.

382
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,141
Which OR is it?

383
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,396
Dr. Park Gyeong-won
is asking which OR it is.

384
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,065
All right. Understood.

385
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,776
Emergency OR.

386
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,115
Hey, Ppark Gyeong.

387
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,742
Don't you find it annoying?

388
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,244
They're shoving an emergency case
down our throats.

389
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,663
That's what emergency means.
Did you not know that?

390
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,831
What now, kid?

391
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,961
It's required by law to have some of us
on standby for emergency surgeries.

392
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,630
But we only go to scheduled surgeries.

393
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,674
If there's a problem, that would be it.

394
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,801
You little punk. Hey!

395
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,261
Get back here.

396
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,596
Hey, Ppark Gyeong!

397
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,979
Hello, Dr. Ma.

398
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,109
If you're heading this way at this hour,
is it for trauma surgery?

399
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,861
Yes.

400
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:44,863
Don't go.

401
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,533
Why would you say that?

402
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,703
The Trauma Center's been trying
to hire a full-time anesthesiologist.

403
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,622
No one's applied for two years.

404
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,668
Don't lead those people on.

405
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,505
Go back.

406
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,507
I'll send someone else to the OR.

407
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,815
Dr. Baek!

408
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,192
-Anesthesiology?
-They're not here yet.

409
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,151
Damn it.

410
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,611
One, two, three.

411
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,619
NAME: CHO SEOK-JUN, GENDER: MALE
UPPER/LOWER ABDOMINAL RUPTURE

412
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,416
Dr. Baek.

413
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,168
Dr. Han, take care of the lower abdomen.

414
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,920
You want me to join this surgery?

415
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,548
Colorectal surgeons
do rectal surgeries all the time.

416
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,717
-This is quite a challenge.
-Just gown up already.

417
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,177
All right.

418
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,681
Damn it. Where is the anesthesiologist?

419
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,558
I'll start with propofol.

420
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,934
Okay. Hurry.

421
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,402
Propofol is in.

422
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,611
Hold on.

423
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,113
What should I do first?

424
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,698
I'm compressing the wound

425
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,285
with my index finger, middle finger,
and the lower part of my palm.

426
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,870
Okay. I'll do this.

427
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,538
Hold still until I wash my hands.

428
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,831
-Okay.
-Three minutes.

429
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,458
-Three minutes.
-Yeah, all right.

430
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,375
Three minutes.

431
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,586
Hurry!

432
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,712
Hurry up!

433
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,629
Hey!

434
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,552
Hang on a little longer, please.

435
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,179
My hands are slipping!

436
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,597
Please.

437
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,724
Shit.

438
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,810
Hurry! His BP is dropping!

439
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,854
What are you doing?

440
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,397
I asked for three minutes.

441
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,859
-With all your experience, you failed?
-Hurry up and do something!

442
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
-One, two.
-Right.

443
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,112
Okay. Hold tight. Scalpel.

444
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,614
Right here, sir.

445
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,115
-I'm making the cut.
-Okay.

446
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,325
-Hold tight.
-Got it.

447
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,919
Despite the major accident,
in which a tour bus fell off the bridge,

448
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,464
there were minimal fatalities,
thanks to the medical professionals

449
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,926
who arrived at the site early
and leveraged the golden hour.

450
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,928
Minister Kang Myeong-hui

451
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,180
has urged all hospitals
treating the victims

452
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,224
to provide the highest standard of care.

453
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,143
I am standing outside
the Hankuk National University Hospital,

454
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,728
where three major trauma patients

455
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,606
are undergoing emergency surgery
for serious injuries.

456
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,653
They were transferred here on the advice
of Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk of HNUH,

457
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,780
who was present at the site.

458
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,033
All three patients are said
to be in critical condition.

459
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,166
Suture.

460
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,103
Once the bleeding is contained,
we'll start on the spleen.

461
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,355
All right.

462
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,775
Why are you so slow? Pick up the pace!

463
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,860
I'm doing the best I can.

464
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,780
I know you're giving your all.

465
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,449
Still, try harder.

466
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,285
Damn it.

467
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,953
Why are you in such a rush?

468
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,038
Because I'm a little busy.

469
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,586
The bleeding is under control.

470
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,004
I'm removing the pipe now.

471
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:34,050
NAME: LEE CHANG-HUN, GENDER: MALE
PENETRATING WOUND, PIPE REMOVAL

472
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,776
To join No. 1 as quickly as possible,
I have no choice but to hurry.

473
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,570
The spleen is sutured.

474
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,946
-Cut.
-Okay.

475
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,073
What the… You're done already?

476
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,160
We've handled the urgent issue.
Let's proceed to the lower abdomen.

477
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,369
Yes, Doctor.

478
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,913
I sounded like a resident.

479
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,915
-Is the bleeding not fully controlled?
-No.

480
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,376
There's blood from the retroperitoneum.

481
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,170
Damn it. Time is tight.

482
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,172
What?

483
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,007
What is this?

484
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,509
Should I keep going?
Is all this bleeding okay?

485
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,053
Judging by the bleed,

486
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,597
the adrenal gland is likely destroyed.

487
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,434
What is it?

488
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,977
-Heart rate's rising.
-What next?

489
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,938
-Dr. Baek.
-ABP 160.

490
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,608
-Damn it.
-180.

491
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,692
What's going on?

492
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,445
-Is it the adrenal gland?
-I think the patient has cancer.

493
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,114
-His lymphatics are leaking.
-Lymphatics?

494
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,367
This is a mess. A total mess.

495
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,035
-Act fast!
-Forceps. Metzenbaum.

496
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,870
ABP 190. 200.

497
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,289
What's his BP? Hey.

498
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,625
There's serious bleeding
in the lower abdomen.

499
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,085
This is crazy. Oh my…

500
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,294
What's going on here?

501
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,797
Going from sinus rhythm to arrhythmia. VT.

502
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,882
What is his BP now?

503
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,967
Are we doing this right?

504
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,427
-Tie.
-Yes, sir.

505
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,306
I'm pushing a beta-blocker.

506
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,725
Please stop the bleeding first.

507
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,935
Dr. Baek!

508
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,853
Bovie. Forceps. Quickly.

509
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,897
Hey, do something!

510
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,273
Just give me a moment.

511
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,819
-I'm removing the adrenal gland itself.
-What?

512
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,320
Have you lost your mind?

513
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,490
It could go horribly wrong.
What are you thinking?

514
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,661
Dr. Baek! Think this through, will you?

515
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,663
What if you slip up?

516
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,664
Dr. Baek.

517
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,040
Listen, you…

518
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,044
Dr. Baek.

519
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,090
That's it?

520
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,007
Blood pressure?

521
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,177
ABP 180. It's falling slowly.

522
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,763
How much beta-blocker was given?

523
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,681
Five milligrams.

524
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,852
Max fluid infusion started 30 seconds ago.
I'll keep it at 500 mg for ten minutes.

525
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,353
Sounds perfect.

526
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,814
Let's finish up.

527
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,234
Yes. Let's stitch everything up.

528
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,152
No.

529
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,738
You'll finish up by yourself.
I need to check on No. 1.

530
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,532
Are you leaving me to do this alone?

531
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,242
His vital signs are stable.

532
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,369
Dr. Park will help you with the rest.

533
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:07,912
This patient

534
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,915
owes half his life to him.

535
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,714
You're actually leaving?

536
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,136
Baek Kang-hyuk here.
How is the surgery going?

537
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,764
We're doing the best we can, but--

538
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,057
He's bleeding! Blood! Gauze, please.

539
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,143
We need another unit of blood!

540
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,312
Please increase the suction.

541
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,229
Hello?

542
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,814
Hey!

543
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,566
Damn it.

544
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,735
You can't just hang up like that. Damn.

545
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,408
-It won't stop. Press down!
-Yes, Doctor.

546
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,702
I've found it. Out!

547
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,537
-Okay. Right--
-Right-angle.

548
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,664
Yes.

549
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,212
And then…

550
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,881
You want size three suture thread.

551
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,301
Thank you.

552
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,022
What about the blood?

553
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,651
Dr. Baek.

554
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:24,405
Move your hand. I can't see the screen.
Look at you, still lost in the mesentery.

555
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,990
The thing is,

556
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,826
this was split in half.

557
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,994
You should've cauterized all the cuts.

558
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,124
Your lousy ties have caused the bleeding.

559
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,794
The fat and arteries
must be completely separated.

560
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,171
I was in such a rush earlier…

561
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,091
Go to your place.

562
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,008
Sir?

563
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,727
Dissector.

564
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,772
No. 1.

565
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,732
-Yes?
-Watch closely.

566
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,444
Once you get past the fatty tissues
and reach the blood vessels,

567
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,323
you need to tie it off like this
within one centimeter of the wound.

568
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,283
Yes, sir.

569
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,334
NAME: JANG JI-U, GENDER: FEMALE
OPEN TIBIA FRACTURE

570
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,377
Suction.

571
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,341
The EKG is slowing down, sir.

572
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,345
Why would that happen?

573
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,263
What's all this?

574
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,849
Prepare epi and atropine.
Bring out the defibrillator.

575
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,684
-Call a Code Blue. Quick!
-Yes, Doctor!

576
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,145
REQUESTING RESUSCITATION TEAM
FOR PATIENT IN CARDIAC ARREST

577
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,148
Code Blue. Main building OR 25.

578
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,776
No. 1. Retie what you worked on earlier,
and take a good look further in.

579
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,236
If it looks okay,

580
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,280
cauterize all the other bleeds
and close up.

581
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,489
Sir?

582
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,782
You're leaving now?

583
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,993
Where are you going?

584
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,789
The right leg is okay,
and the bleeding is controlled.

585
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,917
So what's the matter?

586
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,003
Code Blue. Main building OR 25.

587
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,838
Code Blue.

588
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,011
-Back to normal rhythm.
-Huh?

589
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,097
She's back. Get down now.

590
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,437
Who's there? Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk?

591
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,355
Yes.

592
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,814
How is the patient?

593
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,318
The ventilator is set to 11 breaths
per minute, but there's no gas exchange.

594
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,487
The saturation has dropped to 60.

595
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,531
Is diabetes the only condition she has?

596
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,991
-Yes.
-Put her on full oxygen.

597
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,868
And start loading heparin.

598
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,994
Heparin, sir?

599
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,913
Don't question it. Hurry.

600
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:37,830
Yes, sir.

601
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,875
Dr. Baek, please explain what's happening.

602
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:46,255
What can happen when a fracture coincides
with this kind of vascular injury?

603
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,674
Bones are filled with fat,

604
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,260
so when they break,
the fat flows into the veins.

605
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,012
That's right.

606
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,349
It passes the right atrium and ventricle,
blocking the pulmonary artery,

607
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,476
which causes a pulmonary embolism.

608
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,311
As expected, you know your stuff.

609
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,354
That's right.

610
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,900
Heparin is in.

611
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,361
Saturation is increasing.

612
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,905
The worst of it is behind her.

613
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,156
I'll take the left leg.

614
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,117
-Please redo the draping.
-Yes, sir.

615
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,412
Open fracture surgery
is not in everyone's wheelhouse.

616
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,456
Exactly.

617
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,418
That's why I'm doing it.

618
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,641
Doctor.

619
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,354
Don't let it get to you.
He's difficult to please anyway.

620
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,233
Still, it was the first time
he put me in charge.

621
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,238
What's the point of a fellowship
if you're already good?

622
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,409
Do you think?

623
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,205
Don't you remember
the massive bleeding earlier?

624
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,916
We managed with just four units of blood.

625
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,628
Truth be told,

626
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,507
I wasn't sure he'd still be alive
when Dr. Baek got here.

627
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,967
But he's still alive.

628
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,344
You did well.

629
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,476
Thank you, Nurse Cheon.

630
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,397
The relatively low fatality rate
of the major accident

631
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,608
has been attributed
to Dr. Baek's efforts on site.

632
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:33,654
The three trauma patients at HNUH
are undergoing emergency surgery.

633
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,365
Their condition
is being closely monitored.

634
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,451
Minister of Health and Welfare…

635
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,454
Seriously. Damn it.

636
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,916
How are we going to deal with this?

637
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,459
-This is insane.
-Dr. Im.

638
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,169
Chief, outside the center--

639
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,506
How are the trauma patients
from Sowol Bridge?

640
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,258
I'm not entirely sure.

641
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,968
Are you kidding me?

642
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,138
If the head of emergency medicine
can't provide an answer, who can?

643
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:03,017
Actually, Dr. Baek takes care
of all trauma patients.

644
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,186
We play more of a supporting role.

645
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,771
Anyway, outside the center--

646
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,857
Forget it. Just find out what's going on.

647
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,611
What if Dr. Baek
happens to make a mistake?

648
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,947
Think about the hospital's reputation!

649
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,290
What the…

650
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,128
The patients were only admitted
three hours ago.

651
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,130
How come he's already out here?

652
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,800
Deaths on the table?

653
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,636
Are they dead?

654
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,012
All three of them?

655
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,098
Oh no.

656
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,976
-Director, we're doomed.
-Chief, are you okay?

657
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,104
Hello.

658
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,273
Baek Kang…

659
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,483
Baek Kang-hyuk!

660
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,528
Why, that little bastard!

661
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,905
Chief? No, please don't.

662
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,323
-Stop right there!
-Outside…

663
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,449
-Baek Kang-hyuk!
-Chief!

664
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,910
-Baek Kang--
-Chief--

665
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,667
Old man in the back, move.

666
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,586
-Old man? Damn you!
-Chief!

667
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,421
I mean…

668
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,381
Who are they?

669
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,134
Reporters.
They've been waiting for Dr. Baek.

670
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,135
What for?

671
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,929
The Sowol Bridge victims--

672
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,184
Don't tell me he's about to announce
their deaths in front of this crowd?

673
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,894
No way. He wouldn't.

674
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,854
That nutcase!

675
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,355
Any updates on the patients?

676
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,899
How did the surgeries go?

677
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,025
Listen, everyone.

678
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,443
Your attention, please.

679
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,907
As for the three patients
admitted to the Trauma Center today,

680
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,950
they are

681
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,369
all alive.

682
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,413
Please look this way.

683
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,540
That's Baek Kang-hyuk, all right.

684
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,046
It wasn't just me.

685
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,427
It was something we achieved together.

686
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,012
Sir?

687
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,348
This is Dr. Yang Jae-won.

688
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,685
He helped save a patient
impaled by a pipe in the abdomen.

689
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,065
-Dr. Yang, look over here, please.
-Back straight.

690
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,650
-Yes, sir.
-Just one word, please.

691
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,443
Smile for the cameras.

692
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,487
-This way, please.
-Over here too.

693
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,741
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk's surgeries
on the Sowol Bridge victims

694
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,535
all ended in success.

695
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,664
-Dr. Baek's done it.
-Isn't that so cool?

696
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,416
-He's shocked the public again.
-Should I go to med school?

697
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,086
Aside from myself
and Dr. Yang Jae-won here,

698
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:40,508
many nurses and other medical staff
are working hard behind the scenes.

699
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,303
And one person has taught me
the meaning of dedication.

700
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,180
My colleague.

701
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,809
Nurse Cheon Jang-mi.

702
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,118
THE SAINT OF THE TRAUMA CENTER!
NURSE CHEON JANG-MI

703
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,871
Additionally,
in challenging situations like today,

704
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,292
caused by our ongoing staff shortages,
some people stepped up to help.

705
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,377
The head of surgery,

706
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,547
Dr. Han Yu-rim.

707
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:25,303
LIVING THE LIFE OF INNER PEACE
THE IMPORTANCE OF COLORECTAL HEALTH

708
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,723
Dr. Park Gyeong-won of anesthesiology.

709
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:33,060
I extend my deepest gratitude
to both of them.

710
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,022
The Trauma Center is a team.

711
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,567
Today would've been impossible
for me alone.

712
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,404
But because we had each other,
we made it through.

713
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,241
Please, if I may make a request,

714
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,078
continue to show your concern
as you've done today.

715
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,831
It will help us save even more lives,

716
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:59,420
which means that you, too,
will play a part in it.

717
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,965
This hospital will not rest
on today's results.

718
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,258
It will work even harder

719
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,554
to meet the public's expectations
and become a leading trauma center.

720
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,892
As the first step, we promise
to prioritize securing trauma fellows

721
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:17,229
and ensuring the availability
of medical staff at all times.

722
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,608
Smile.

723
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,153
What a show-off.

724
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,198
Dr. Baek, you don't mean…

725
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,910
This is our chance
to achieve our long-standing goal.

726
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,288
Chief?

727
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,043
At the Trauma Center,

728
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,420
we're doing our best
with the limited budget.

729
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,631
In order for us to do even better,

730
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:48,177
I propose the recruitment of more staff.

731
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,054
No, yes. I mean, no.

732
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,723
-Well…
-Please say a few words.

733
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,810
Well, that's…

734
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,479
Chief, look this way.

735
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,773
That is beyond my authority.

736
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,109
You'd need to talk to the director.

737
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,902
I thought so.

738
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,821
Director Choi Jo-eun?

739
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,948
I know you're watching.

740
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,200
This is my formal request.

741
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,036
Smile.

742
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,539
Baek Kang-hyuk.

743
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,166
Is this how you want to play it?

744
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,344
MINISTER KANG MYEONG-HUI

745
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,681
Look this way, please!

746
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,182
Over here, please!

747
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,228
Doctor, this way!

748
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:37,776
