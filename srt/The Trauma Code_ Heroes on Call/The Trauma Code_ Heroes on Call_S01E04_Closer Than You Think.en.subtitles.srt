HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

2
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,273
This is Yang Jae-won.

3
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,089
Spinal needle.

4
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,382
One, two.

5
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,678
Just a moment! Excuse me! Sorry!

6
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,930
Prescribe 1 g of IV acetaminophen.

7
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,940
Warm saline!

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:06,858
Gauze.

9
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,654
Apply pressure!

10
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:53,071
BASED ON THE WEBTOON SERIES

11
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,678
THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

12
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,169
JI-YEONG

13
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,254
"Ji-yeong"?

14
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,840
I guess he has time for dating.

15
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,342
I should push him harder.

16
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,429
This…

17
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,307
Do you know who Choi Jo-eun is?

18
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,892
The name rings a bell.

19
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,437
He's our director. Director Choi Jo-eun.

20
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,022
Director?

21
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,859
No wonder.

22
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,697
He's been calling nonstop about a meeting.

23
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,951
EMAIL: HNUH BUDGET MEETING

24
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,536
You absolutely must attend it!

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,622
Must I? Why?

26
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,375
I know it's temporary,
but you're the head of trauma surgery.

27
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,964
You shouldn't expect too much, though.

28
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,549
No-name…

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,552
Junior attendings won't have a say.

30
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,471
It's a party for the senior folks.

31
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,226
I'm the best in the world
at crashing those kinds of parties.

32
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,647
You got a call from Ji-yeong.

33
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,653
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
BUDGET MEETING

34
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,987
Next, I would like to invite

35
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,366
the head of general surgery
and head of colorectal surgery,

36
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,451
Dr. Han Yu-rim.

37
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,494
Yes.

38
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,414
Right here.

39
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,049
-Hello.
-Hello.

40
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,592
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

41
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,511
-Good morning.
-Hello, sir.

42
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,845
Good morning, sir.

43
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,014
This way, please.

44
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,558
-Mic test.
-Doc!

45
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,647
Dr. Han.

46
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,400
This is an official occasion.

47
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,443
My apologies, Chief.

48
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,736
That's more like it.

49
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,826
So, are you here to drop a bomb?

50
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,247
I did some digging into that guy,
Baek Kang-hyuk.

51
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,501
I will seal his fate right here today.

52
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,593
Head of Biomedical Engineering,
Dr. An Jeong-hyeon.

53
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,223
Head of Hemato-Oncology,
Dr. Shin Hyeon-jeong.

54
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,599
This way, please.

55
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,936
Excuse me, sir.
Please wait for your name to be called.

56
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,355
Why can't we enter in the order we arrive?

57
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,399
It's the standard procedure.

58
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,942
This way, please.

59
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,448
Next, Head of Nuclear Medicine,
Dr. Jeong Hyeon-mi.

60
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,616
This way, please.

61
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,248
-Dr. Lee Gi-beom of Allergy Medicine.
-Standard procedure, my ass.

62
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,083
-Please enter.
-What a load of crap.

63
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,420
Subspeciality heads
have no real power or influence.

64
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,839
You'd be lucky to add your two cents

65
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,759
and more than lucky
to retain the allocated budget.

66
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,012
Subspeciality heads
may now all enter at once.

67
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,186
It's one hell of a crowd.

68
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,520
It is.

69
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:59,233
All those departments are eyeing
the Trauma Center funding, not just us.

70
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,790
Any department with even one trauma case
a year has a horse in the race.

71
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:19,212
The funding will most likely be allocated
to purchasing shared equipment.

72
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,757
In short,

73
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,967
it's a war zone.

74
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,803
There are no allies.

75
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,723
"ACTING" HEAD OF TRAUMA SURGERY
BAEK KANG-HYUK

76
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,936
The director has arrived.

77
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,281
Let's get right down to business.

78
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,158
Chief?

79
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:55,289
We've hit the 30 billion won profit
milestone this year!

80
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,374
What a breakthrough!

81
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,214
Well done, everyone.

82
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,384
Topping the chart as always is…

83
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,554
What an achievement.

84
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,139
For the second year in a row,

85
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,307
the funeral hall.

86
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,145
You can't beat the funeral hall.

87
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,356
Second is the parking lot.
The cafeteria, third.

88
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,234
And in fourth place…

89
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,946
Fourth place goes to…

90
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,158
Neurosurgery.

91
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,495
Congratulations.

92
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,166
Dr. No's recognition
as a top expert in Gamma Knife surgery

93
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,834
has led to a spike in revenue.

94
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,753
It's almost on par with the cafeteria.

95
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,464
Just a moment.

96
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,717
Dr. No.

97
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,346
You did an amazing job.
One more round of applause!

98
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,974
Applause!

99
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,110
If they had a fistfight over the budget,
Dr. Baek would win hands down.

100
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,361
What a shame.

101
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,155
I know. What a shame.

102
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,781
By the way,

103
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,368
you know that day
Dr. Baek bought us dinner?

104
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,328
Yes.

105
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,538
-Remember how I got there first?
-Yes.

106
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,831
Guess who I saw there.

107
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,376
Who?

108
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,504
That evening,

109
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,258
as I arrived there
and was being shown to our table…

110
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,137
Good evening.

111
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,807
Thanks.

112
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,647
I reserved a private room for us.

113
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,113
It seemed like an affair.

114
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,031
What?

115
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,951
As far as I know, he's a single father.

116
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,870
The vibe was nothing like
your average married couple.

117
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,624
Dr. Han opened the door for her
and pulled out her chair.

118
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,627
No, it can't be.

119
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,966
Just a moment.

120
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,553
Yang Jae-won of trauma surgery.

121
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,514
A traffic accident?

122
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,350
In-car? All right, thanks.

123
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,895
At least the injury would be less severe
than a pedestrian one.

124
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,773
Prep the resuscitation room.
Be ready for CPR.

125
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,567
Without calling Dr. Baek first?

126
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,238
I'll check the patient first.

127
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,240
-He's still in the meeting.
-All right.

128
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,493
Please look at the chart.

129
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,789
It's time to discuss our deficits now.

130
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,457
HNUH PROFIT STANDINGS
THORACIC SURGERY

131
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,542
Thoracic surgery.

132
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,420
It's around 342 million won to date.

133
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,338
Where is thoracic surgery?

134
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,467
Compared to last year,
you've made a good effort.

135
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,969
That's right, sir.

136
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,639
The deficit of the ob-gyn department
also dropped below 100 million won.

137
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,558
Dr. An.

138
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:05,271
Let's work a little harder
and get into the black. Let's go!

139
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,397
Let's go.

140
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:12,320
Urology, rehabilitation medicine,
and the rest are all similar except for…

141
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:15,990
trauma surgery!

142
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,788
Note that the trauma surgery figures
are only for the last month.

143
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,249
Trauma surgery.

144
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,087
Minus 412.52 million!

145
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,133
My goodness. That's just…

146
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,318
Dr. Baek.

147
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,488
Honestly, this figure is way out of line.

148
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,658
Excuse me,
but your calculations are a bit off.

149
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,536
You should add the ten billion won
the Trauma Center received.

150
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,914
That puts trauma surgery in the black.

151
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,209
That money is for the entire hospital,

152
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,086
not just for trauma surgery.

153
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,921
Anesthesiology, emergency medicine,

154
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,008
and all other relevant departments
collaborate in patient care, as you know.

155
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,468
Exactly.

156
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,180
By that logic, the loss should fall
on the entire hospital,

157
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,598
not just trauma surgery.

158
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,850
-Aren't I right?
-Whatever you say.

159
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,602
That's not the point here.

160
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,688
The numbers speak for themselves.

161
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,025
Are you saying that everyone
gets to enjoy the sweet benefits

162
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,612
while my department
is left to clean up the debris?

163
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,738
Excuse me?

164
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,490
Listen, all of you.

165
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,076
We're all here to save lives, aren't we?

166
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,285
Aren't we?

167
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,042
Come on. This is a respectable meeting.

168
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,129
Please observe decorum.

169
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,631
Dr. Baek.

170
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,386
I know you go to great lengths
to save those trauma patients--

171
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,806
I appreciate you recognizing my efforts.

172
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,477
Recent statistics show
that the survival rate of trauma patients

173
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,355
has increased dramatically
since my arrival.

174
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,817
All right. Congratulations.

175
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,405
Good for you, but now I'd like to see
a dramatic decrease in the deficit.

176
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,617
It's already been decided
that over nine billion won of the funding

177
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,536
will go toward the equipment budget.

178
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,748
So let's put an end to that debate and--

179
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,841
Has he gone mad or what?

180
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,176
I apologize.

181
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,387
Our director sure has the gift of gab.

182
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,972
Your joke was hilarious.

183
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,809
What joke?

184
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,270
Wasn't it a joke?

185
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,522
Let's say you're serious.

186
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,526
One billion won minus the deficit
leaves us with only 500 million

187
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,862
to save patients until next year.

188
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,239
Only a lunatic would expect us to do that.

189
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,699
It's utter nonsense!

190
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,618
Baek Kang-hyuk!

191
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,579
I've let you run wild for long enough.

192
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,999
Director Choi is being ever so kind,
and that's how you respond?

193
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,627
You sure as hell are a worthless fucker!

194
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,920
What?

195
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,046
A fucker?

196
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,257
-I know how to swear too.
-Go on. Try me!

197
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,969
Go on, you despicable jerk.
I'll rip your face off today.

198
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,137
-Calm down.
-Wait.

199
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,817
-Traffic accident. No pulse.
-How long has she been out?

200
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,568
-Flatlined two minutes ago.
-Wait!

201
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,362
Stop. Let me take a look first.

202
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,863
Why haven't you used the i-gel?

203
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,242
-Where is her next of kin?
-We can't reach them.

204
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,537
Ji-yeong.

205
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,086
Jae-won.

206
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,130
I got into Hankuk Med School.

207
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,632
Really?

208
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,884
Congratulations.

209
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,556
-You're following in your dad's footsteps.
-No, I'm following in yours.

210
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,516
That makes you my senior now, right?

211
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,980
Let's transfer her to a bed.

212
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,948
Dr. Yang!

213
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,076
We can't get a pulse on the patient!

214
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,996
Ji-yeong!

215
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,539
One, two, three.

216
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,250
-Call Dr. Baek now!
-Okay!

217
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,127
-Quickly!
-Let's hurry!

218
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,295
-Quickly!
-This way!

219
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,631
You save a few lives
and get on your high horse about it.

220
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,842
Look at you all high-and-mighty.

221
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,136
You snub me
because I'm a colorectal surgeon?

222
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:51,682
Who is the real money-grubber here?
You hypocrite!

223
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,601
What on earth are you on about?

224
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,978
You have no idea. I have some information.

225
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,439
Do you know what kind of man
Baek Kang-hyuk is?

226
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,651
Yeah, you, Baek Kang-hyuk!
I'm about to expose your true nature--

227
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,944
-Hang up the phone!
-Why?

228
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,363
How dare you! This is a sacred meeting--

229
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,364
Yes, tell me.

230
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,242
I've got a call, too,
but I'm not answering.

231
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,411
I rejected the call. Hang up right now!

232
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,080
Hang up, you bastard.
This is a critical moment and…

233
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,832
What the heck?

234
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,000
-Dr. Han.
-What is it?

235
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,752
Is Han Ji-yeong your daughter?

236
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,756
-She's in the ER now. Car accident.
-Wait. What are you saying?

237
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,634
-Your daughter was in a traffic accident.
-Are you sure?

238
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,094
-Bring Dr. Baek with you. Hurry!
-Say that again.

239
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,804
We're doing CPR.

240
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,973
-What?
-You need to get down here right now!

241
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,933
Hurry!

242
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,601
You're doing CPR?

243
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,562
How badly is she hurt?
Why does she need CPR?

244
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,480
Hold on.

245
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,106
Wait.

246
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,234
Baek Kang-hyuk!

247
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,402
Baek Kang-hyuk!

248
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,821
Baek Kang…

249
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,115
Dr. Baek.

250
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,826
-I was harsh earlier--
-Move. It's an emergency.

251
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,578
No! You can't go!

252
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,246
Save my daughter first.

253
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,457
It was a traffic accident.

254
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,628
They're doing CPR.
My daughter needs your help.

255
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,381
If anything happens to her, I'll die.

256
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,633
She's my everything.
I've raised her on my own.

257
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,052
Dr. Baek.

258
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,554
Can you save my Ji-yeong first?

259
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,514
Please?

260
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,893
I was on my way to save your daughter.

261
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,023
The time you just wasted
has put her in more danger. Got that?

262
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,493
Ji-yeong.

263
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,161
Ji-yeong!

264
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:37,997
Ji-yeong!

265
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,958
Epinephrine.

266
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,042
Epinephrine. Hurry!

267
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:42,960
Yes!

268
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,170
Epinephrine is in.

269
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,346
Ji-yeong!

270
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,473
Block the view with the curtains!

271
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,726
-Ji-yeong!
-Dr. Han!

272
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,144
-Dr. Baek!
-No! Ji-yeong!

273
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,939
-No. 1! Be calm and accurate.
-Yes, sir!

274
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,358
-Get the defibrillator ready.
-Yes, Doctor.

275
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,027
Ji-yeong!

276
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,737
Get out of my way!

277
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,155
-Move, damn it!
-Keep him out.

278
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,656
-Yes, sir.
-Let go!

279
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,783
Let go already!

280
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,035
Dr. Han.

281
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,162
-Calm down.
-Step aside!

282
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,121
Please, not now.

283
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,165
-You can't go in there.
-Like hell I can't!

284
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,917
-She's my daughter!
-That's why. You know that!

285
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,962
Let go! Damn it!

286
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,221
Ji-yeong.

287
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,433
Is it really bad?

288
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,352
Yes.

289
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,774
Oh no…

290
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,613
I can't believe this.

291
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,115
My poor Ji-yeong.

292
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,578
If you went in there now,

293
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,288
you'd only get in the way.

294
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,458
We'll let you in once things are sorted.

295
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,548
Wait.

296
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,425
Look.

297
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,095
If…

298
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,516
it just so happens

299
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,602
that things get really bad,

300
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,814
just let me know.

301
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,817
I should be by her side then.

302
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,444
Okay?

303
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,198
All right, Dr. Han.

304
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,125
Catheter. 150 mg of IV amiodarone.

305
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,751
-Prepare for intubation.
-Okay!

306
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,714
V-fib.

307
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,007
-Get down.
-Yes, sir.

308
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,385
Charge to 200 joules.

309
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,847
Charged to 200.

310
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,848
Clear.

311
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,974
Shock.

312
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,062
She's still in V-fib.

313
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,188
-Charge again.
-Okay.

314
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,569
Charged.

315
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,239
Clear.

316
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,749
Shock!

317
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,585
How did it go?

318
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,924
Is she alive?

319
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,217
Her sinus rhythm is back.

320
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,473
My goodness. Thank you.

321
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,266
I'm just so thankful.

322
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,978
We need an echocardiogram now.

323
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,521
Wait a second!

324
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,983
What would a trauma surgeon do
with an echocardiogram?

325
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,695
I will call a cardiologist.
Wait before you do anything.

326
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,614
-But--
-Hurry up and go.

327
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,409
A trauma surgeon
can't read an echocardiogram.

328
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,081
No. 1, what does it look like to you?

329
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,127
Dr. Baek, this is…

330
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,380
We'll perform emergency surgery.

331
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,132
Are you close to her?

332
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,431
Step back if it's too hard.

333
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,975
You'll only distract us.

334
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,690
No, sir. I can do it.

335
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,653
-Call anesthesiology.
-Yes, sir.

336
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,366
DR. HAN YU-RIM

337
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,289
-Yes, Dr. Han?
-Hey! What took you so long to answer?

338
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,834
-I need your help. Please hurry here.
-Right now?

339
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,585
You don't understand!

340
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,963
My Ji-yeong is in the ER!

341
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,589
Ji-yeong?

342
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,301
Come check her echocardiogram, please!
It's urgent.

343
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,927
Hang on a second. Hey!

344
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,680
Ji-yeong! Where are you going? Where?

345
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,056
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

346
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,392
-Yang Jae-won! Where are you going?
-Dr. Han!

347
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,978
Dr. Han, pull yourself together!

348
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,105
Listen carefully.

349
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,982
Your daughter

350
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,984
has a heart rupture.

351
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,986
What are you on about?

352
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,031
Over 90% of
the left ventricular lateral wall is torn.

353
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,242
Are you sure? You may be wrong.

354
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,787
Didn't you hear me? It's a heart rupture.
She needs surgery immediately!

355
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,705
What if?!

356
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,832
What if you open her chest and it fails?

357
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,042
-Will you fix it?
-Yes!

358
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,336
I'll take responsibility!

359
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,341
Hey!

360
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,051
Stop!

361
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,385
What's going on?

362
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,386
SIM JAE-MIN, CARDIOLOGY

363
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,221
Dr. Han, you have to stop him.

364
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,683
You can't all be serious!

365
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,811
Are you really about to perform surgery?
Without my consent?

366
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,646
You can do that for emergency surgery.

367
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,857
Let's recheck the echocardiogram.

368
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,776
What for? I've seen it already!

369
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,194
Because I don't trust you!

370
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,196
What?

371
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,325
How do I know you won't harm my daughter
just to spite me?

372
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,786
No. 1!

373
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,288
You and Gangster, come here.

374
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,374
Yes, sir!

375
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,043
-Start the anesthesia.
-Okay.

376
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:58,960
Yes?

377
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,671
He is Ms. Han's next of kin.

378
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,215
-I know.
-That's right!

379
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,716
I'm her next of kin.

380
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,218
So just wait.

381
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,261
-Wait for the cardiologist!
-Hear that?

382
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,223
Wait while her heart bursts?
Does he sound sane to you?

383
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,267
Sir, now is not the time for this.

384
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,687
If the next of kin is deemed unfit

385
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,982
to make a sound judgment
due to insanity or equivalent reasons,

386
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,194
the surgery may proceed
with the consent of two doctors, right?

387
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,113
Yes, that's right.

388
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,406
That's bullshit!

389
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,784
He's not in his right mind here,
so give your consent.

390
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,871
I've given mine.

391
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,956
You crazy bastard!

392
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,749
-Please, Dr. Han!
-You're crazy!

393
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,418
-Please calm down.
-What consent?

394
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,628
-If my daughter dies…
-Dr. Baek.

395
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,922
-BP is dropping.
-What if she dies?

396
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,132
-No, you can't!
-Hurry.

397
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,967
We have five minutes to open her chest!

398
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,471
-Just calm down, Dr. Han.
-No!

399
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,556
-Jae-won!
-Don't worry.

400
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,183
Please, Jae-won. Don't do it. You can't!

401
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,519
At this rate, we really will lose her!

402
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,023
I consent!

403
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,694
Consent? How could you?

404
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,155
No!

405
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,739
Stop!

406
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,493
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

407
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,870
Please.

408
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,246
Just open the door.

409
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,789
What are you even thinking?

410
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,874
Han Yu-rim!

411
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,042
Oh God, Jae-min!

412
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,795
Baek Kang-hyuk is in the OR
with my daughter right now.

413
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,505
Has he started yet? Let me go in.

414
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,756
-Quickly!
-No, you can't.

415
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,966
Move aside at once!

416
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:28,967
You can't come in.

417
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,385
But I'm a cardiologist!

418
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,888
-I can't let you in.
-Please!

419
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,389
Please…

420
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,142
Please.

421
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,729
Just open the door.

422
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,361
NAME: HAN JI-YEONG, GENDER: FEMALE
HEART RUPTURE

423
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,623
-He cut her chest open!
-Just hold still.

424
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,959
No. 1! Stay focused.

425
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,086
Cut.

426
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,464
Scissors.

427
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,925
Good God!

428
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,219
A rupture?

429
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,554
-Really?
-Gangster!

430
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,640
-Hang in there, Ji-yeong!
-Get them out.

431
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,974
-Ji-yeong!
-Dr. Baek.

432
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,726
She's losing too much blood.

433
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,564
Give me a glove.

434
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,650
-Pardon?
-A new surgical glove. Quick!

435
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,821
Hurry!

436
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,032
Block the bleed.

437
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,158
With my hand?

438
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,201
-Do it!
-Yes, sir.

439
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,624
Dr. Han!

440
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,209
Dr. Han! Wake up!

441
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,503
What should we do now?

442
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,380
Please do something!

443
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,215
Keep holding. I'll add an extra layer.

444
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,427
Otherwise, the patient will die
before we can even close her up.

445
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,264
You're using that?

446
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,143
How would you use that to--

447
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,186
Move your hand.

448
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,198
Hey, get stitching!

449
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,783
Yes, I'll suture it.

450
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,006
Step aside, Dr. Sim.

451
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:34,843
Ji-yeong!

452
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,303
Ji-yeong.

453
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,432
What happened to my Ji-yeong?

454
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,271
Closing a wound with a surgical glove?

455
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,148
Do some studying. Seriously.

456
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,525
How can you be a trauma surgeon
and not know this?

457
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,487
How would I know without being taught?
None of this is in our textbooks.

458
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,906
Hey. You think this is over?

459
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,784
Sorry, Doctor.

460
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,164
Everyone, listen up.

461
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,918
The surgical glove will hold
for ten minutes at best.

462
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,046
We'll use that time for reinforcement.

463
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,088
Stay sharp.

464
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,299
Suture.

465
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,225
First, we resect the pericardium
to make it wider than the glove,

466
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,438
put it on top of the glove,
and then suture it.

467
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,151
Dr. Baek.

468
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,405
Do we leave the glove there?
It's sterile and all, but is it okay?

469
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,573
Are you mad?

470
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,700
Of course we'll remove it.

471
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,952
Get me an endoscope.

472
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,746
An endoscope?

473
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,505
One used by otolaryngologists
for nasal surgery?

474
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,925
-You'll find them in the old building.
-"You have five minutes. Run!"

475
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,179
That's what Dr. Baek said.

476
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,769
A nasal endoscope for heart surgery.

477
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,646
I've never heard of such a thing.

478
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,108
Dr. Han!

479
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,361
Move. One moment. Where am I?

480
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,737
-Otolaryngology!
-Goodness!

481
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,322
Wait a minute. This way.

482
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,658
What will become of the Trauma Center?

483
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,361
Oh, so that's how it comes out.

484
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,165
Okay. All done.

485
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,876
Dr. Park, how is her BP?

486
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,794
120 over 80. It's perfect.

487
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,756
Okay. Next.

488
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,757
Next?

489
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,384
We close her up.

490
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,600
Surgery is over.

491
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,477
How did it go?

492
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,897
Ji-yeong is alive.

493
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,774
She made it!

494
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,733
She's alive?

495
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,027
My daughter.

496
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,112
She's alive.

497
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,998
Now what do you think
about trauma surgery that bleeds money?

498
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,878
Thank…

499
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,548
What was that?

500
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,593
I said "thank you."

501
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,771
Do you understand now
why trauma surgery is indispensable?

502
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,651
Severe trauma can happen to anyone.

503
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,446
You'd be a fool to think you're exempt.

504
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,910
Thank you.

505
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,662
I'm really grateful.

506
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,832
Thank you, Dr. Baek.

507
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,595
Open your eyes.

508
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,514
It's Dad. I'm here.

509
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,307
Ji-yeong.

510
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,059
Hey, Anus.

511
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,394
-Yes?
-Yes?

512
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,604
I thought you meant me.

513
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,066
No, this Anus.
No. 1 doesn't quite roll off the tongue.

514
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,442
How is her breathing?

515
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,863
Spontaneous breathing is back.
We're monitoring her without sedatives.

516
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,283
Take a look, Dr. Baek.
The surgery went well, didn't it?

517
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,995
Keep calling her name. She's likely
to respond to a familiar voice.

518
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,955
Ji-yeong.

519
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,999
Open your eyes.

520
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,333
It's Dad.

521
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,419
Can you hear my voice?

522
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,631
Ms. Han Ji-yeong. Try opening your eyes.

523
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,307
Ji-yeong!

524
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,100
Ji-yeong, can you see me?

525
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,936
Do you recognize your dad? Ji-yeong…

526
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,980
Or a stranger's voice might do the trick.

527
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,773
-We're in a hospital.
-Keep calm.

528
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,609
The patient needs complete rest.

529
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,197
Wait a moment.

530
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:49,991
Dr. Baek,

531
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,910
I'm so very grateful.

532
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,621
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

533
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,331
Thank you so much.

534
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,294
There are many ways to repay me.

535
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,630
Many ways, indeed.

536
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:15,850
Here.

537
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,938
Thank you for everything.

538
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,442
For starters,
let's discuss the budget again, yeah?

539
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,112
Yes, of course.

540
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,865
I'll put in a good word with the chief.

541
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,325
But

542
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,286
I think you just said "Yeah?"

543
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,581
I think I'm old enough
to deserve some manners.

544
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,625
Fine. All right. Yeah.

545
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,626
Thank you.

546
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,714
Moving on,
let's return to that conversation.

547
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,092
Which one?

548
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,804
You've got some dirt on me, have you?

549
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,892
The thing is…

550
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,021
That Baek Kang-hyuk dude. What's his deal?

551
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,110
You must know.
You were a key member of the IMAFP.

552
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,194
I'm not sure.

553
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,406
He was very much an outsider.

554
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,159
You spent six years with him.
You must know something.

555
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,288
Hang on. He wasn't with us last year,
so it's five years.

556
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,624
He wasn't there last year?

557
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,087
I heard he was scouted by a certain group.

558
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,297
There were fishy rumors.

559
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,215
What rumors?

560
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,342
I think it was in Afghanistan.

561
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,846
He made a fortune there

562
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,347
saving lives

563
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,683
and sometimes taking them.

564
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,727
Taking lives?

565
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,770
It's a conflict zone.

566
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,356
You think he only held scalpels?

567
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,608
He must've held guns too.

568
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,568
Guns?

569
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,988
What was the name of that group again?

570
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,450
Black Wings.

571
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,791
That crazy bastard.

572
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,919
A murderer like him in our hospital?
No way!

573
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,880
At tomorrow's meeting,

574
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,798
I'll blow his…

575
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,675
I haven't told a soul.

576
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,968
Not a single person.

577
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,428
Nothing.

578
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,056
By the way,

579
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,600
you're a real force of nature.

580
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,895
I heard they are
the world's top private military company.

581
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,979
And…

582
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,233
I did some research.

583
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,986
But you didn't actually
kill anyone, did you?

584
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,945
Dr. Han.

585
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,323
No way someone like you
would do that for money--

586
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,535
Dr. Han.

587
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,747
There's an old saying.

588
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,793
What you don't know won't hurt you.

589
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,186
What the…

590
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,031
Ever since Dr. Baek arrived,
the Trauma Center has been quite…

591
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,993
That whole thing with Ji-yeong…
And remember Lee Gi-yeong?

592
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,372
While rushing over after hearing
his father was pronounced brain-dead,

593
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,290
he got in a car accident.

594
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,837
It's incredible that he ended up
in the same hospital.

595
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,298
To top it all, the father happened
to be an organ donor.

596
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,759
So the son received his liver.

597
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,263
Is it because they're family?

598
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,308
He's making a very speedy recovery.
He's already off the ventilator.

599
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,646
I heard his sister regained consciousness
this morning.

600
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,023
They must be together by now.

601
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,024
Gi-yeong.

602
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,282
Are you okay?

603
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,830
The Trauma Center may be tough,
but moments like these make it worthwhile.

604
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,133
Are you two crying?

605
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,678
-No.
-I'm not crying.

606
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,433
What's wrong? Are you crazy?

607
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,353
Dr. Baek, don't you feel sad at all?

608
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,438
Sad about what?

609
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,607
They're both alive. I don't get it.

610
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,234
It's a sad story!

611
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,741
That'll raise their BP.
I hope this doesn't turn into a situation.

612
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,829
Oh, here they are.

613
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,084
I'm making my TV debut today.

614
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,670
Sorry?

615
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,636
Hey, the Organ Donation Agency
is under the Ministry of Health, you know.

616
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,678
Right.

617
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,597
This case was the first of its kind,

618
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,142
so they offered to pay
the entire hospital bill.

619
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,310
Really?

620
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,228
Yes.

621
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,564
In exchange for having
the story published?

622
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,359
I have no reason to refuse.

623
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,070
I say "Thank you so much."

624
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,114
We get free PR out of it too.

625
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,532
PR?

626
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,702
I've learned something
from all the dirty fights I've been in.

627
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,413
Do you know the secret to always winning?

628
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,417
Outnumber your opponents.

629
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,169
So that means

630
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,005
we need to get many people on our side.

631
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,424
Yes, I'm coming.

632
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,428
Wanna come?

633
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,472
No. I'll be here, studying.

634
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,809
As you wish.

635
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,603
Please say a few words.

636
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,731
Right.

637
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,281
They've called in TV reporters,
just like you asked.

638
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,326
Since we're already in the game,
we might as well go national.

639
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,204
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.
I'm Nam Su-ho of Goryeo TV.

640
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,499
-Yes.
-I was very moved by the story.

641
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,669
You did the initial assessment, Dr. Baek.
Please explain--

642
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,004
Whose phone is that?

643
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,133
-Turn it off, please.
-Who is it?

644
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,261
-That's so rude.
-Turn it off, please.

645
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,804
Dr. Baek of trauma surgery.

646
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,557
-Please hang up. You're on live TV--
-Pardon?

647
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,516
A patient?

648
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,560
Sorry? Hello?

649
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,936
I can't hear you.

650
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,521
I'm a little tied up.

651
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,148
Just a moment.

652
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,858
-We're all busy too.
-Hello?

653
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,610
Shut up!

654
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,449
Just shut up!

655
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,411
-Did he just say "Shut up"?
-"Shut up"?

656
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,748
No, I wasn't speaking to you, Mr. An.

657
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,418
There appears to be an emergency patient.

658
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,971
So there was an actual case.

659
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,731
"Black Wings."

660
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,318
"Black Wings."

661
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,618
-Yes, Dr. Baek?
-No. 1.

662
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,371
Have you overcome
your fear of heights yet?

663
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,622
No.

664
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,415
We're going in a helicopter again.

665
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,251
Get my sneakers and the trauma kit.

666
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,253
Come to the heliport right now.

667
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,421
Okay.

668
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,825
-Hold this.
-Yes, sir.

669
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,526
Dr. Baek, by the way,
have you heard of "Black Wings"?

670
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:05,345
