00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,791
AWESOME! A TRUE DOCTOR!

5
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,875
Brilliant.

6
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,627
SEND HIM TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY!

7
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,880
I THINK HE IS KINDA SEXY…

8
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,970
"Way to go, Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk!"

9
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,600
"Hot guy. I'm rooting for you!"

10
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,310
"Hot guy"?

11
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,478
Why? What?

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,315
Are you showering yourself
with compliments again?

13
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,651
Why not? It's not like I'm wrong.

14
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,488
Attention seeker.

15
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,658
"Attention seeker"? How dare you.

16
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,494
It wasn't me. It was Nurse Cheon.

17
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,497
That's right. I said it.

18
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,501
Nurse Cheon, I didn't mean to…

19
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,963
Dr. Baek, this is all your fault.

20
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,843
Don't you see what I'm getting at?

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,637
What do you mean?

22
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,186
Where does our department stand
in this hospital?

23
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,482
A money pit, a thorn in the side,
and a budget-gobbling monster.

24
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,859
Exactly.

25
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,488
In a situation like this,
what do we need to do to survive?

26
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,948
We should bring in money.

27
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,951
How on earth are we supposed to do that?

28
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,246
Take a look at this.

29
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,627
First, we set up our defenses
by winning over public opinion.

30
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,963
Then we continue saving lives.

31
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,301
Once people recognize
the importance of the Trauma Center,

32
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,096
the hospital will no longer
be able to mess with us easily.

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,472
Right.

34
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,515
What I'm saying is,

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,853
I am the Trauma Center's sacred soil.

36
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,396
You're the Holy Son.

37
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,773
She's the Saint.

38
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,821
We can't have her expose herself.

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,365
Sorry about that.

40
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,013
I haven't got all day,
so let's get things moving.

41
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,557
Congratulations.

42
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,893
You got your lifelong wish.

43
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:52,148
Let's hold off on congratulations
until we've fully staffed up.

44
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,816
"Fully staffed up"? That's--

45
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,528
I wonder if Minister Kang
has time to take a call.

46
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,072
Are you threatening me?

47
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,573
Yes.

48
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,868
You hit the nail on the head.

49
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,039
MINISTER KANG MYEONG-HUI

50
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,750
Following the Sowol Bridge accident,

51
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,880
public interest in the Trauma Center
has spiked significantly.

52
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,176
Isn't this the perfect time
to give them our full support?

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,053
- This way, ma'am.
- Right.

54
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,806
Director Choi, you do agree, don't you?

55
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,060
<i>The IMAFP has announced the resumption</i>
<i>of medical activities in South Sudan,</i>

56
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,105
<i>following the peace agreement</i>
<i>signed last August.</i>

57
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,691
Put out a recruitment notice
for the Trauma Center.

58
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,609
Pardon? But Director Choi--

59
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,237
Minister Kang says she's counting on us.

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,197
She's asked for our full support.

61
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,449
Don't concern yourself too much.

62
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,661
The ongoing posting
gets zero applicants anyway.

63
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,747
The deficit is already driving me mad,
and now this!

64
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,043
Guess how many helicopter calls
we had last week. No fewer than five!

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,503
The cost is piling on.

66
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,339
Does he have a grudge against me
or something?

67
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,008
I know what you mean.

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,933
You sound as if you don't care.

69
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,269
Excuse me? Do I?

70
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:17,025
Am I the only one
taking the current situation seriously?

71
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,986
We can't let Baek Kang-hyuk
run wild like that.

72
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,903
Right.

73
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,447
Don't tell me…

74
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,450
If the deficit continues,
I will lose my position.

75
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,618
Is that what you're waiting for?

76
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,912
Please don't say that.

77
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,164
Of course not!

78
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,666
Forget about being the next director.

79
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,753
It's your current role as chief
that's in jeopardy.

80
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,548
To offset the deficit, we'll have
to let go of our highest-paid staff.

81
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,342
That'd be you, Chief Hong.

82
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,554
I'm fully aware, sir.

83
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,931
Just being aware won't cut it.

84
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,560
You should take action.

85
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,694
He's always bossing me about.
I'm practically his servant.

86
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,030
He might as well ask me
to wipe his ass too.

87
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,990
Is everything okay?

88
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,161
Director Choi is going berserk
because of Baek Kang-hyuk.

89
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,287
I see.

90
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,999
He approved the additional budget
for trauma surgery against his will,

91
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,667
and now he's all fired up.

92
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,419
Really? It's been approved?

93
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,338
My reaction exactly. It's been done.

94
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,801
That's a relief.
I was about to bring it up anyway.

95
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,886
A relief?

96
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,183
I mean, you know how it is!

97
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,228
When it comes to trauma surgery,
deficits are unavoidable.

98
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,313
Why would that concern you?

99
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,733
Since I'm the head of general surgery--

100
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,905
Exactly. How can you sound so carefree
when the hospital is about to go under?

101
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,619
Did you have a change of heart
because he saved Ji-yeong?

102
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,703
Sorry?

103
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,833
You really think I'd switch over
to Baek Kang-hyuk's side?

104
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,043
How could you think that of me?

105
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,461
What do I mean to you?

106
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,131
We've shared the same fate
through life's ups and downs!

107
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,882
Loyal friends for 20 years!

108
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,514
What use could I possibly find
for such a softie?

109
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,479
It's that fucking helicopter again!

110
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,773
Goddamn it.

111
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,193
Hey!

112
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,405
Keep the noise down!

113
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,451
You assholes!

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,960
Baek Kang-hyuk's wings?

115
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,882
I'll have them clipped. Simple as that.

116
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,804
Dr. Baek, where should we go?

117
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,889
The emergency OR!

118
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,394
Good luck!

119
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,562
Thank you!

120
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,445
While I contact the next of kin,

121
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,655
you go register the patient
at the reception.

122
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,242
- Isn't that the medics' job?
- Let's help each other out a little.

123
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,245
At least we work in shifts.
They hardly get any sleep. Go.

124
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,167
Could I make a quick phone call?

125
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,171
No. 1.

126
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,798
- Prep for a thoracotomy.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,091
Intubating now.

128
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,052
- Dr. Park?
- Yes?

129
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,263
His BP's low. Administer muscle relaxants
as slowly as possible.

130
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,723
"Dr. Park"?

131
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,769
How come you never call me Dr. Yang?

132
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,104
Shut up and get on with disinfection.

133
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,942
Yes, sir.

134
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,736
The breathing tube is in.
I'll start on the anesthetic.

135
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,157
Hand towel.

136
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,200
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,495
You unfolded it?

138
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
Gown.

139
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,256
Right. Of course.

140
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,513
What am I dealing with?

141
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,557
My name is Agnes.

142
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,267
I wasn't asking for your name.

143
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,893
She's new here.

144
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,273
She's Catholic.
That's why her name is Agnes.

145
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,942
She's come over from emergency medicine,
so go easy.

146
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,528
I asked for extra hands.

147
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,447
And they send a clueless rookie?

148
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,621
No. Leave it. Put it down!

149
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,583
My princess.
You just sit here and don't move.

150
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,126
I'll take care of everything.

151
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,799
Damn it. What a racket!

152
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,639
Doc…

153
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,108
Fire Commissioner, sir. It's me.

154
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,194
- Dad?
- What is he doing over there?

155
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,656
How kind of you to come
and visit me in person.

156
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,866
Why, of course.

157
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,951
I should attend to you myself.

158
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,998
I've brought your doctor up to speed

159
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,251
so you can commit to your recovery
while you're here.

160
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,048
<i>The fire commissioner?</i>

161
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,508
<i>Why is Jae-hun with that man?</i>

162
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,139
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>
<i>A really bad feeling.</i>

165
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,728
What?

PERSONNEL TRANSFERS
AN JUNG-HEON TO ADMINISTRATION

170
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,746
Pediatrics agreed
to give an official response, right?

171
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,956
Yes, they said they'd email us today.

172
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,708
The prognosis isn't too bad.

173
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,251
Dr. Baek.

174
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,255
A patient fell in Bukhansan
and sustained a severe head injury.

175
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,091
- Gangster, get ready.
- Okay.

176
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,009
But we can't go.

177
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,969
What the hell?

178
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,763
What I mean is,

179
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,724
I called the National Rescue Unit
right away.

180
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,476
Apparently, Mr. An Jung-heon

181
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,521
has been transferred out.

182
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,198
National Rescue Unit.

183
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,991
<i>This is Baek Kang-hyuk of HNUH.</i>

184
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,080
There's a rescue request for Bukhansan.
Why can't we deploy the helicopter?

185
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,998
<i>Listen, Dr. Baek. Let me explain--</i>

186
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,918
I think you should come
and pick us up right now.

187
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,880
Just a moment.

188
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,798
A moment?

189
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,677
- Every second counts! What's going on?
- <i>Hello?</i>

190
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,721
<i>Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk?</i>

191
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,305
Yes. Who am I speaking to?

192
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,807
I'm the new team leader.

193
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,475
119 AIR RESCUE UNIT
CHO DEOK-GYU

194
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,852
I've been briefed about you.

195
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,937
Dr. Baek, our records show

196
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>that you've been using the helicopter</i>
<i>as if it were your own.</i>

197
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>You can't act at your convenience.</i>
<i>This is state property.</i>

198
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,945
- "At my convenience"?
- What is it?

199
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,364
You even piloted it at one point.

200
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,700
Do you have a helicopter license?

201
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,452
<i>Is that really important right now?</i>

202
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,371
Would I have taken the controls
if I didn't have a license?

203
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,791
- Just send the helicopter right away.
<i>- Don't raise your voice.</i>

204
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,419
<i>Going forward, telephone requests</i>
<i>will not be accepted.</i>

205
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,715
Send an official form, obtain approval,
and follow the procedures.

206
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,842
What a load of--

207
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,594
Hello? Hey!

208
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,138
- Dr. Baek.
- That son of a--

209
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,806
Dr. Baek!

210
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,516
No cursing.

211
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,351
Calm down.

212
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,354
Just breathe.

213
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,939
Damn it!

214
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,694
What's wrong? What is it?
Is the helicopter really not coming?

215
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,530
No matter what Dr. Baek says,
they won't budge.

216
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:02,990
Forget it.

217
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,035
Bukhansan is more urgent right now.

218
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,787
Contact the rescue team on site.

219
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,247
Hello?

220
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,584
<i>This is Yang Jae-won of HNUH.</i>
<i>What's the patient's current status?</i>

221
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,878
His BP is 80 over 50.

222
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,839
Unconscious
with no pupillary reflex in the left eye.

223
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,092
- Are you on your way?
- About that…

224
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,221
I don't think
we'll be able to depart right now.

225
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,723
The National Rescue Unit
asked for an official request.

226
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,849
<i>An official request?</i>

227
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,769
But they only approve those
in the morning.

228
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,147
Do they know it's an emergency?

229
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,107
<i>We tried to reason with them…</i>

230
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,404
Is it accessible by car by any chance?

231
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,823
<i>Yes, it's possible.</i>

232
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,451
<i>We'll get the patient to the trailhead,</i>
<i>so please come as quickly as you can.</i>

233
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,661
All right.

234
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,331
Damn. Hey!

235
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,042
What were you thinking?
Are we calling a taxi or something?

236
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,795
You may as well tell them
to call one for the patient.

237
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,422
We have an ambulance.

238
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,758
- An ambulance?
- Yes.

239
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,100
We're really short on time.
What's all this?

240
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,519
- Tell me about it.
- What is this thing?

241
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,938
We've been using the helicopter instead.

242
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,233
But they purchased a high-end ambulance
with the Trauma Center funding

243
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,110
just for the higher-ups to show off.

244
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,488
This has everything we need.
Why did we leave this baby alone?

245
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,739
Let's go right now.

246
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,908
Yes, sir. I'll get in the back, Dr. Baek.

247
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,789
- Gangster, get in.
- But I should stay here.

248
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,792
- No, we need you for the head count.
- What head count?

249
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,460
Just get in. Quickly.

250
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,201
Dr. Baek, could you please take it easy?

251
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,997
Why did you bring me with you?
Did you want to kill me?

252
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,969
Look ahead!

253
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,981
BUKHANSAN NATIONAL PARK

254
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,984
Hey, No. 1! We're almost there.
Check their exact location.

255
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,071
We're nearly there. Where exactly are you?

256
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,825
Dr. Baek! Turn right at the fork.

257
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,730
It's been ages. I've lost my touch.

258
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,856
That was too slow.

259
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,651
Slow? It was like a runaway train
with no brakes.

260
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,736
Be quiet. Here comes the patient.

261
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,405
Dr. Yang, hurry! Let's go!

262
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,458
- Time is tight, so let's talk on the way.
- Okay.

263
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,676
I'll move our car out of the way.

264
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,812
I've still got it from my days
as a part-time valet in Gangnam.

265
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,945
No pupillary reflex on the left?
When did you last check?

266
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,364
At the time of discovery,
but not after that.

267
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,117
Thankfully, there's no urination
or defecation.

268
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,078
- Okay. Let's start. Shave his head first.
- Yes, sir.

269
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,839
Nothing on his right either.
We must hurry.

270
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,466
Is it serious?

271
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,636
There's nothing we can do
for direct damage to the brain.

272
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,723
But if it's a temporary effect
of brain hemorrhage, there's hope.

273
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,477
We should've arrived sooner.

274
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,314
Finish shaving. Then disinfect his head.
We need to make an incision right away.

275
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,316
Hold on. An incision?

276
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,151
- In a moving vehicle?
- Yes.

277
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,153
We need to open it now.

278
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,663
<i>Jang-mi. Are you on your way?</i>

279
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,334
Request a neurosurgery consult
so they can see him upon arrival.

280
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,007
There is no free space at all
in his skull.

281
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,260
Intracranial pressure is very high.

282
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,514
This is bad. We can't even see the bleed.

283
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,266
Is that really bad?

284
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,395
If the bleed is the cause,
we can simply remove it.

285
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,065
But when the brain is swollen like this--

286
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,693
Give him steroids.
Let's make another hole.

287
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,363
What? Another hole?

288
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,534
What are you waiting for?

289
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,291
What's the point?

290
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,337
His BP is dropping.

291
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,267
His pulse is still okay.
Disinfect quickly.

292
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,936
The brain stem is already herniating.

293
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,729
We have to do what we can.

294
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,316
Hurry up and treat the patient.

295
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,944
No. 1!

296
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,532
What's the point of us giving our all?
Everyone else just gives up.

297
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,826
So? Are you saying we should give up too?

298
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,747
The hospital is constantly on our backs
about deficits or whatever.

299
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,418
They won't fly the helicopter
without a request.

300
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,336
What's all this, Dr. Baek?

301
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,630
Stop putting it down to the helicopter.

302
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,258
- This is in our hands now.
- That's exactly it.

303
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,345
If only they'd flown the helicopter,
this patient might've had a chance.

304
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,555
Shut your mouth!

305
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,226
Can't you see that this patient is dying
as you're spouting nonsense?

306
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,563
Shut up and hold him.

307
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,857
We're making a second hole.

308
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,916
Dr. Baek.

309
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,877
We requested a neurology consult.
They're waiting for you.

310
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,429
- I'm No Jun-yong.
- The Head of Neurosurgery himself.

311
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,598
I've been waiting for a chance
to lend a hand.

312
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,350
I see. Thank you.

313
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,393
- Prepare for CT.
- Yes, Dr. No.

314
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,403
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

315
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:43,575
Did something happen on the way here?
I think I heard some bickering.

316
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,789
His overall brain function
has significantly decreased.

317
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,209
The sensory function is doing okay, but…

318
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,463
- The problem is with the motor function.
- Yes.

319
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,509
Even if he does wake up,
he'll likely require lifelong care.

320
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,555
Thanks to your initial treatment,
he is alive for the time being.

321
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,101
Well, this is the acute phase.

322
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,937
Let's run some more tests
and keep an eye on him.

323
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,149
There's no need to request consults.
We'll be monitoring his progress.

324
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,860
I'd appreciate your help.

325
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,074
Dr. Baek.

326
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,035
His next of kin is here.

327
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,713
The patient

328
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,341
is in a vegetative state.

329
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,387
Is there nothing you can do?

330
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,098
I'm so sorry.

331
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,643
Oh God!

332
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>Would he have been better</i>
<i>if they'd taken the helicopter?</i>

333
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,074
<i>Dr. Baek seems devastated.</i>

334
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,456
<i>Besides the tracheostomy en route,</i>
<i>he also bore two holes in the skull.</i>

335
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,877
<i>He took every possible measure.</i>

336
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,589
He fought tooth and nail
to keep that patient alive.

337
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,768
Did they not fly the helicopter?

338
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,652
This smells fishy.

339
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:47,032
Jae-hun and the fire commissioner
were laughing together earlier.

340
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,201
I'm 100% sure about this.

341
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,827
Should I tell him?

342
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,412
Or not?

343
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,042
I can't become friends
with Baek Kang-hyuk.

344
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,880
What did he do to deserve it? Forget it.

345
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,894
- Hello?
<i>- Listen carefully to what I'm saying.</i>

346
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,815
I heard the helicopter was grounded today.

347
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,484
No helicopter means fewer patients.

348
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,404
If you have fewer patients,
the deficit will halve.

349
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>- Do you get what I'm saying?</i>
- Dr. Han, what are you talking about?

350
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,329
How did he know it was me? Is he nearby?

351
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,712
<i>Dr. Baek.</i>

352
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,841
<i>You can't tell anyone</i>
<i>that you heard it from me.</i>

353
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,802
<i>It's about the grounded helicopter.</i>

354
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,349
<i>I think it might have something to do</i>
<i>with Chief Hong.</i>

355
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,230
You're a circulatory system expert.
Is that why you take the circular to work?

356
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,649
I take the Jayu-ro occasionally.

357
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,861
Dr. Baek?

358
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,865
What do you think you're doing?

359
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,078
I should ask you the same thing.

360
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,580
What on earth are you doing?

361
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,208
I don't follow--

362
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,293
The helicopter.

363
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,794
Helicopter?

364
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,504
What about it?

365
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,967
It was you, man,
who grounded the helicopter.

366
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,261
What did you call me?

367
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,179
Dr. Baek.

368
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,348
We nearly lost a patient.

369
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,188
Let's say it was me.
Do you have any evidence that I did it?

370
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,857
You can't just pin the blame on me.

371
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:48,737
I assume a patient was in danger
because the helicopter was grounded.

372
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,157
But you mustn't go around
pointing fingers without evidence.

373
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,367
Fucking hell.

374
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,703
"Fucking hell"? How dare you…

375
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,290
A patient nearly died, and as a doctor,
all you care about is evidence?

376
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,919
You piece of shit.

377
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,046
- Dr. Baek, don't talk like that.
- You punk!

378
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,005
What?

379
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,467
So you care about your fucking face
but not the patients?

380
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,053
You bastard! Do you really want to die?

381
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,972
My back!

382
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,310
Just sit still

383
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,520
for your own sake.

384
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,443
Chief. Are you okay?

385
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,779
Get off me. Damn it!

386
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,035
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

387
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,162
You must be crazy.

388
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,498
Why would you do that?

389
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,876
You're right. I was crazy.

390
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,338
Knowing what Dr. Baek is like,
why did you lash out at him?

391
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,800
I honestly have no idea.

392
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:53,843
Seriously…

393
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,268
Yes, Nurse Cheon?

394
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,853
<i>Dr. Yang. Where are you?</i>

395
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,355
<i>Dr. Baek is looking for you.</i>

396
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,857
Dr. Baek?

397
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,736
<i>Yes. He wants you to come</i>
<i>to the roof of the old building right now.</i>

398
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,030
<i>- Do you know where that is?</i>
- The old rooftop?

399
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:19,160
It'll be all dark and creepy up there
at this hour.

400
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,662
<i>Hurry along.</i>

401
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,729
What was that?

402
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,647
I thought it was a person.

403
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,192
- What?
- Doctor!

404
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,069
Nurse?

405
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,573
What are you doing here?

406
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,118
Actually, I called you up here.

407
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,120
Really?

408
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,956
What for?

409
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,292
I heard you had a tough day.

410
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,835
The paramedic told me.

411
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,379
So you know.

412
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,009
I come up here whenever I get pissed off.

413
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:21,806
This air vent runs every five minutes.
And when it does, I go like this…

414
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,062
You fucking bastards!

415
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,815
- You fuckers!
- What's wrong with you?

416
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,776
- You worthless scum!
- Nurse! Stop it!

417
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,403
Hey! A person was dying!

418
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,822
And you fuckers grounded the chopper!

419
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,115
I'm going to kill you!

420
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,117
I'm going to kill you all!

421
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:45,664
Why is she always venting her frustrations
on the damn vent?

422
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,749
Just leave her. She's a good kid.

423
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,292
Fucking assholes!

424
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,418
Stop! Please!

425
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,671
I'm going to kill you!

426
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,347
That really takes a weight off my chest.

427
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,143
- You should try too. Go on.
- What?

428
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,023
- No, it's okay. I'll pass.
- Come on! Quickly!

429
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,025
- Why not?
- It's just that…

430
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,487
I don't know how to curse.

431
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,660
Then just say whatever you want.

432
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,870
Anything at all.

433
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,040
Okay.

434
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:36,089
Hey! You son of a bitch…

435
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,229
It stopped running.

436
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,232
Try again later.
It'll come back on in five minutes. Sorry.

437
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,819
This is hilarious.

438
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,071
I'm sorry.

439
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,116
I'm not very good at comforting people.

440
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,743
Not at all. It's fine.

441
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:08,621
It did make me feel a lot better
for what it's worth.

442
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,666
Really?

443
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,085
I'm glad.

444
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,047
I was scared that you'd leave us for sure.

445
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,802
I'm not going anywhere.

446
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,516
To be honest, I am angry at Dr. Baek.

447
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:35,356
I mean, I don't understand
why we should go to such great lengths.

448
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,487
I think I know why.

449
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,946
What?

450
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,699
Because we can.

451
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,076
There's no reason not to try.

452
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,125
When I look at you,

453
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,462
I can see my old self.

454
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,547
I used to think,

455
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,469
"Why am I going through all this
when no one even acknowledges it?"

456
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,262
I asked myself all the time.

457
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,059
But we don't do this
for the acknowledgment, do we?

458
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,354
We don't expect rewards either.

459
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:16,898
Right.

460
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,691
Just look at me.

461
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,611
Do you think
I've been doing this for five years

462
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,863
because I'm some kind of superhero?

463
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,077
I do it because I have to.

464
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,620
Someone has to do it,

465
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,664
and it just so happens to be me.

466
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,291
And you happen to share
the same misfortune.

467
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,543
It is what it is.

468
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,380
Let's just

469
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,132
do our best to hang in there.

470
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,306
Thank you.

471
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,316
DR. BAEK KANG-HYUK: TO THE CAFETERIA

472
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,282
COLORECTAL SURGERY

473
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,619
Why is he summoning me
out of the blue at this hour?

474
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,122
Does he know I snitched?

475
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,541
I bet he does.

476
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,549
Did you ask for me?

477
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,176
Yes. Take a seat.

478
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,555
You're working late.

479
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,515
Don't work too hard.

480
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,601
Your health might suffer.
We need you well.

481
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,769
Yu-rim.

482
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,814
Yes, sir! Your Yu-rim is all ears.

483
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,442
I…

484
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,281
must take Baek Kang-hyuk down.

485
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,159
Pardon?

486
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,873
You said you had dirt on that bastard.

487
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,852
Doctor…

488
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,729
Dr. Baek.

489
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,025
Have some food.

490
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,568
Okay.

491
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,667
I want to apologize
for almost giving up on the patient.

492
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,045
It happens.

493
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,422
Sir?

494
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,217
Why put in all this work

495
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,136
for a death nobody cares about?

496
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,849
I used to wrack my brain over that too.

497
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,816
Did I tell you?

498
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,777
My father.

499
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,279
He died in a traffic accident.

500
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,782
Yes. You mentioned it.

501
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,036
That day,

502
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,206
he was on the brink of death.

503
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,835
But not a single hospital would take him.

504
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,961
It was infuriating.

505
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,257
The problem is,

506
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,428
those deaths keep occurring
again and again.

507
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,558
People who could be saved
but are given up on.

508
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,352
That kind of death?

509
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:42,812
So,

510
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,859
I vowed never to give up
on a patient before me.

511
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,278
A bit cringey, but yeah.

512
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,615
You should find your own reason.

513
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,747
Something that will keep you in place
even when you're worked like a dog

514
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,875
and treated like shit.

515
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,840
To walk this tough and gritty path

516
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,886
for no reason at all…

517
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,347
is simply too hard.

518
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,187
This isn't your last will, is it?

519
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,564
Crazy bastard.

520
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,155
I'm going to get some sleep now.

521
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,032
Okay.

522
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,367
I'm a little tired today.

523
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,583
Hey, No. 1.

524
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,628
Yes?

525
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,171
Don't be sorry.

526
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,550
You just haven't found your reason yet.
You didn't give up.

527
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,765
Sit back down.

528
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,352
Eat slowly but quickly.
Eating is part of our job too. Okay?

529
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,357
Yes, sir.

530
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,557
Why won't you tell me?

531
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,353
Why can't you say,
"I know Baek Kang-hyuk's dirty history"?

532
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,107
Have you already decided
to side with that bastard?

533
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,109
- No, sir.
- Then what?

534
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,905
Doc, please let it slide just this once.

535
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,366
You know very well
how loyal I've been to you.

536
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,326
I do indeed.

537
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,162
That's why

538
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:10,168
I've been backing you up
by generously funding colorectal surgery.

539
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,296
But you've changed.

540
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,213
What?

541
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,091
Okay. I've got it.

542
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:22,805
I've been stressing about where to find
that extra funding for trauma surgery.

543
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,475
Your department will do.

544
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,395
Why are you doing this to me?

545
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,149
Yu-rim.

546
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,028
Have I not told you

547
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,071
to choose your side wisely?

548
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,783
Seeing as you are so adamant
on this matter,

549
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,494
I have no choice.

550
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,958
Baek Kang-hyuk.

551
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,461
What is that bastard's weakness?

552
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,087
His weakness?

553
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,216
I can't tell you.

554
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,222
I won't.

555
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,225
Are you messing with me, you prick?

556
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,685
I'm taking your advice
and choosing my side wisely.

557
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,689
He saved my only daughter's life.
What kind of man would ever forget that?

558
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,110
We've been friends for 20 years,
and you didn't even visit her.

559
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,247
So this is how you want to play it?

560
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,295
I'll take my leave, Director Choi.

561
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,047
All right. You may leave.

562
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,342
Hello, Chief.

563
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,135
Hi.

564
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,112
- What is this?
- Take a look, sir.

565
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,739
I'll let you have a look first.

566
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,538
The patient's family
wants a full investigation.

567
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,165
I knew this would happen,

568
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,584
despite all his big talk and mighty acts.

569
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,921
This has become a headache, hasn't it?

570
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,172
Not quite.

571
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,927
This is the perfect opportunity
to get rid of Baek Kang-hyuk.

572
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,683
Don't you think that would be a stretch?

573
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,226
Our reputation…

574
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,396
I've already thought of that.

575
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,860
So you've got a plan!

576
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,829
A stab wound patient.

577
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,372
It's about 15 cm.

578
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,332
He's conscious,

579
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,918
but almost the entire blade's inside,
so no first aid could be performed.

580
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,670
Are we going straight into surgery?

581
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,548
To CT first.
We need to check how far it's in.

582
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,803
Let's prep for a thoracotomy too.

583
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,263
Nurse Cheon.

584
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,598
What is it?

585
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,187
I can't stop laughing.

586
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,106
It's like a ten-year-old weight
has been lifted off me.

587
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,608
Are you sure about this?

588
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,526
I'm telling you. I'm not going.

589
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,278
Still, it's an emergency.

590
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,279
Not my problem.

591
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,991
- Ppark Gyeong.
- Is this about the Trauma Center?

592
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,870
Do we have an emergency surgery?

593
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,663
Hey, cut it out, kid.

594
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,999
Hey!

595
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,543
Don't go.

596
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,343
That came out wrong.

597
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,345
You don't need to go.

598
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,019
What on earth? Move aside!

599
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,855
- Out of my way!
- Stop.

600
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,029
We have orders to restrict Dr. Baek
from entering the hospital premises.

601
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,239
- What?
- Pardon?

602
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,198
Why?

603
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,326
It's hospital policy
to suspend all medical activities

604
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,662
for any employee
suspected of malpractice.

605
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,042
<i>- Malpractice?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

606
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,129
<i>Apparently, he performed surgery</i>
<i>inside a moving vehicle.</i>

607
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,755
<i>The family found out somehow.</i>

608
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,133
<i>They wonder if it was excessive.</i>

609
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,009
<i>They're ready to file a lawsuit.</i>

610
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,762
<i>Baek Kang-hyuk is done for.</i>

611
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,434
You're mistaken. That's not true.

612
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,686
I was there, okay? Please step aside.

613
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,688
- This is urgent. Please move.
- Stop him.

614
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,814
Out of my way.

615
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,566
- What are you--
- A life is at stake!

616
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,734
- Move! Damn it!
- Please stop!

617
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,446
Dr. Baek. We can't get into the OR!

618
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,865
It's Chief Hong!

619
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,954
Wait a moment.

620
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,707
You can confirm later. Move aside for now.

621
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,125
Please!

622
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,514
Come on. Just move out of the way!

623
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,640
No. 1.

624
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,229
You get in there somehow and get a CT.

625
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,273
You can go in, right?

626
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,691
Me?

627
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,902
Dr. Baek, wait--

628
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,946
We can get a CT,
but what about the operating room?

629
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:36,376
