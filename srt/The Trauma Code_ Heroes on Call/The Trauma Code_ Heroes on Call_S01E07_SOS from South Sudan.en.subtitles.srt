THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

3
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,161
We have orders to restrict Dr. Baek
from entering the hospital premises.

4
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,248
Wait a moment. You can confirm later.

5
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,458
Move aside for now.

6
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,251
Please!

7
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,296
-Just move out of the way!
-No. 1.

8
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,051
You get in there somehow and get a CT.

9
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,095
You can go in, right?

10
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,596
Me?

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,516
-Dr. Baek, wait--
-Dr. Baek!

12
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,144
We can get a CT,
but what about the operating room?

13
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,688
Dr. Baek.

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,733
BP is dropping. 50 over 30!

15
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,830
Doc, what do we do?

16
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,415
-Doc!
-Sir.

17
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,000
Sir!

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
One second.

19
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,382
-Wait. I need a moment.
-Dr. Yang!

20
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,643
Dr. Yang, snap out of it!

21
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,693
What do we do, Doctor?

22
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,624
Let's go get a CT.

23
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,169
Okay.

24
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,672
Move aside.

25
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,634
Move! Quickly!

26
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,679
Let them through.

27
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,812
I'll call you back later.

28
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,730
Dr. Baek.

29
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,274
What?

30
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,319
Chief Hong has stripped me
of my privileges.

31
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,572
Yes, I heard about that.

32
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,407
It wasn't malpractice.

33
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,325
Dr. Baek.

34
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,078
-The hospital policies state--
-Yes, exactly.

35
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,207
They state that on-site assessment
comes first in the ER.

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,293
Simply put,
whatever bullshit the chief tries to pull,

37
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,588
as the head of Emergency Medicine
and the Emergency Medical Center,

38
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,590
you can override it all, Dr. Im.

39
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,716
Am I wrong?

40
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,803
Time is short. Let's start.

41
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,106
Call emergency medicine!

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,567
-Get the resuscitation team on standby!
-Got it!

43
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,110
Listen, Dr. Im.

44
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,906
The record for the lowest mortality rate
in Korea is at stake.

45
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,034
Wasn't that why you were happy
to provide us assistance?

46
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,537
Because you love
holding onto that record of yours?

47
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,833
Code blue. CT Room, Emergency Center.

48
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,420
Code blue. CT Room, Emergency Center.

49
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,756
Think carefully.

50
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,384
If you don't open up the OR right now,

51
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,428
you will take all the heat
for that patient.

52
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,016
BP is still unstable.

53
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,353
Thank God you've already given him
Hartmann's solution.

54
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,272
I thought BP would be difficult to manage.

55
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,276
Dr. Baek!

56
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,113
How does it look?

57
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,198
We're scanning him with contrast media.

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,660
The blade is inching further in
with every breath he takes.

59
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,167
The contrast is leaking. Damn it.

60
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,254
-Rupture. Move.
-Okay.

61
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,673
The carotid is vital.

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,177
What do we do?

63
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
I got it for now.

64
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,224
Let's insert a CVC,
flush it with saline, and start surgery.

65
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,183
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,316
Dr. Baek! The blade is poking the aorta.

67
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,528
-Call anesthesiology again!
-They're already here.

68
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,322
Anesthesia is ready.

69
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,823
Dr. Park!

70
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,866
How did you…

71
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,494
I trusted Dr. Baek to do whatever it took
to get into surgery.

72
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,121
Isn't that why you're ready too?

73
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,916
All the devices are laid out,
and the CPB is being set up.

74
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,754
Okay. Dr. Baek will be here soon.

75
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,298
We have a difficult case,
so give it your all.

76
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,799
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

77
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,683
-Insane, huh?
-Are you sure about this?

78
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,894
Hey. Don't you believe me?

79
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,938
I've always got the inside scoop
on hospital news.

80
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,985
Dr. Baek is going to meet
his downfall this time.

81
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,530
Dr. Han.

82
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,075
What did Dr. Baek do?

83
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,327
You haven't heard?

84
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,828
Why else would I ask?

85
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,288
What is it?

86
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,040
Well, actually…

87
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,669
Do you remember the patient
whose skull he bore into in the ambulance?

88
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,464
Apparently, the hospital
is recognizing that as malpractice.

89
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,967
So reporters are swarming now.
It's a complete mess.

90
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,599
What on earth is all this?

91
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,976
INVESTIGATION BRIEFING
ON DR. BAEK KANG-HYUK'S MALPRACTICE

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,147
The hospital will step forward
and disclose the malpractice.

93
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,151
The hospital retains its good image.
Baek Kang-hyuk shoulders all the blame.

94
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,197
Do we really need to raise
the stakes so high?

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,826
Sir, now isn't the time to get soft.

96
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,537
Minister Kang has Baek Kang-hyuk's back.

97
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,664
To make her cut ties, we must do this.

98
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,459
The minister placed a crony in our midst,

99
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,628
and he committed malpractice.

100
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,963
That's it.

101
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,925
I like it.

102
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,973
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

103
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,725
The blade is about to stab the heart.
Let's remove it now.

104
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,643
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,937
-Bypass on.
-Bypass on.

106
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,565
-Flow down.
-Flow down.

107
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,734
-ACC on.
-ACC on.

108
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,406
-Flow back up.
-Flow back up.

109
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,784
The CPB setup is complete.

110
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,036
Let's get the blade out first.

111
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,954
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,790
I'll push. You can pull from the top.

113
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,476
Gangster. Do we have
any artificial blood vessels in stock?

114
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,479
There's none. High-cost items
are kept in the central supply room--

115
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,855
Run and get one now.

116
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,356
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,657
Tray, please.

118
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,496
No. 1.

119
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,788
Why aren't you running?

120
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,957
Right.

121
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,922
Out of my way! Move!

122
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,675
Sorry. I'm sorry!

123
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,730
Nurse! How is she so fast?

124
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,069
No. It can't be done.

125
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,529
But

126
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,074
the patient will die
without an artificial blood vessel!

127
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,326
How do you know? You're not a doctor.

128
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,752
Doctor. I'm a doctor.
Give me an artificial blood vessel. Hurry!

129
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,004
The doctor here says he needs it!

130
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:11,092
Expensive items under special management
require the director's approval.

131
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,343
Excuse me, sir.

132
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,845
Do we really need approval to save a life?

133
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,056
-Let us have it.
-Rules are rules.

134
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,141
We have no choice, then.

135
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,019
Doc, we should follow our own rules.

136
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,355
Hey! Where are you going?

137
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,315
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

138
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,609
Hey! Open this door!

139
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,236
I'm sorry, but we're desperate.

140
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,946
Hurry! Find a blood vessel.

141
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,531
Come on!

142
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,575
-Start over here.
-Artificial blood vessel.

143
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,785
It's not here.

144
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,041
Here they are.

145
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,209
I've found it!

146
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,294
Quickly!

147
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,963
You thieves!

148
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,548
I'll take it. I'm faster!

149
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,341
What the heck?

150
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,718
Seriously!

151
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,976
Wait for me!

152
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,979
Wait up, Nurse!

153
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,067
Hey!

154
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,861
-Oh my goodness!
-Yang Jae-won.

155
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,279
Where is Dr. Baek?

156
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,572
-Dr. Baek?
-Yes.

157
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,823
He's in surgery.

158
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,283
We're in serious trouble.

159
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,118
Hong is holding a press conference.

160
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,369
What about it?

161
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,706
I think he's on a mission
to bring Dr. Baek down!

162
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,173
Dr. Baek!

163
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,716
Why not take your sweet time?

164
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,260
There's going to be a press conference

165
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,012
at two o'clock.

166
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,723
It's about the Bukhansan patient.

167
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,975
The chief will acknowledge it
as malpractice.

168
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,061
There are reporters and everything!

169
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,021
You have 25 minutes left, Dr. Baek.

170
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,900
If we let it proceed,
we'll be admitting to malpractice.

171
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,859
So what?

172
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,737
-Sir?
-So what about it?

173
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,074
Should I ditch the patient
and go cause a scene?

174
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,200
We should stop them.

175
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,161
-It wasn't malpractice.
-Just scrub in quickly.

176
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,954
I'm replacing the aorta with this.

177
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,207
-Dr. Baek, you can't.
-Shut up and hurry.

178
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,501
Saving the patient comes first.

179
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,653
What are they getting at?
I should at least do something.

180
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,198
My son

181
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,535
is only 20 years old.

182
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,913
Why should my son

183
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,709
be lying unconscious in a coma?

184
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,383
To prevent a tragedy like this
from happening again,

185
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,177
I hope the truth comes to light.

186
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,155
-Dr. Baek--
-Get on with the sutures.

187
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,413
Dr. No, you had that patient
under observation.

188
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,498
You should step up in times like these.

189
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,710
Unfortunately,
there's nothing I can do to help.

190
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,337
-I only took over from Dr. Baek.
-I know that.

191
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,882
But he was only trying
to save the patient.

192
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,218
He put in desperate efforts.
Please help him out a little.

193
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,470
You'd be better off

194
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,806
finding evidence of his initial treatment
being appropriate.

195
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,393
-Try talking to other trauma specialists.
-Forget it!

196
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,062
-Dr. Han.
-You couldn't help me this once?

197
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,899
Why not? You saw the chart.

198
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,568
I wouldn't have cracked the skull
in that situation.

199
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,488
That's because you can't do it, Dr. Kim.
Dr. Baek can.

200
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,742
Dr. Hwang. Don't take offense.
All I'm saying is--

201
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,786
How will you prove that though?

202
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,622
"Dr. Baek can do it."
How would you prove such a thing?

203
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,916
I get it.

204
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,460
Let me ask you one thing.

205
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,295
What if it were your son, Dr. Jung?

206
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,422
What would you have done?

207
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,634
I would've done the same as a last resort.

208
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,135
Right.

209
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,845
That's what I mean.

210
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,473
Can't you just tell them that?

211
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,310
But hey,
Chief Hong has already contacted everyone.

212
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,394
What do you mean?

213
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,022
At this hospital,

214
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,611
rather than conceal
the possibility of malpractice,

215
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,242
we've decided to conduct
a thorough investigation into the truth.

216
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,578
I have here

217
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,333
statements from prominent trauma surgeons
across the country.

218
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,379
"Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk's treatment
was out of the ordinary."

219
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,799
This objective fact will be proven
by these statements.

220
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,096
This is wrong.

221
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,515
This is wrong,
even for a piece of trash like him.

222
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,267
Hong Jae-hun.

223
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,686
I will expose you to the world.

224
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,120
By flaunting his skills,

225
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,416
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk
committed an act of arrogance

226
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,294
that no doctor should ever engage in.

227
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,505
Numerous medics, including the director…

228
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,506
Baek is fucked.

229
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,384
…have already voiced their concerns
several times.

230
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,344
Yet he seeks only personal glory.

231
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,554
He's fucked!

232
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,182
-We have failed to curb his greed.
-Let go.

233
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,019
-Coming through. Excuse me.
-Such tragic events.

234
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,229
They should never occur under any…

235
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,651
What the hell?

236
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,781
How dare you show your face?!

237
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,993
How could you come here?!

238
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,370
-Ma'am. Calm down.
-Ma'am!

239
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,039
Let go!

240
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,708
Please just hear us out, ma'am.

241
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,549
Attention, please. I am Baek Kang-hyuk.

242
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,051
What is the meaning of this?

243
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,511
This is not a case of malpractice.

244
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,763
Dr. Baek!

245
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,098
Here's the press release.

246
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,269
Where is the security team?

247
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,562
Pass them back, please.

248
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,690
I'd like to prove
that my treatment wasn't wrong.

249
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,233
Please take a look.

250
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,778
There was another patient
with the same condition.

251
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,404
OPERATIVE REPORT

252
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,454
We bore into that patient's skull
while being transferred by helicopter.

253
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,129
The same procedure
on two patients with the same condition

254
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,882
had different outcomes
due to the golden hour.

255
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,843
The patient in the helicopter lived.

256
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,720
But the patient in the ambulance…

257
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,646
fell into a coma.

258
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,399
That day,

259
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,402
the helicopters were grounded.

260
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,866
Are you passing the buck
to the National Rescue Unit?

261
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,827
No. Of course not.

262
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,288
Someone else should be held accountable.

263
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,581
And who's that?

264
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,961
Someone instigated
the grounding of the helicopters.

265
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,132
I'm here to denounce that person.

266
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,594
Fire Commissioner?

267
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,726
You're telling me you never required
official requests for helicopter dispatch.

268
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,977
-Is that correct?
-Ma'am.

269
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,896
That's a misunderstanding.

270
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,732
A misunderstanding?

271
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,943
Then who the hell was it?

272
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,486
Chief?

273
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
There he is.

274
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,204
What is all this nonsense?

275
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,415
Have you got any proof?

276
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,252
The Fire Commissioner will step down,
and the police investigation will begin.

277
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,588
Everyone,

278
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,591
you know these are all blatant lies,
don't you?

279
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,178
I have always had
the patients' best interest--

280
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,638
What? The patients' best interests?

281
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,141
Could you say that
in front of Mr. Kim Dong-seok?

282
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,934
-Who's that bastard?
-You don't know?

283
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,269
Just tell me who it is!

284
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,562
Kim Dong-seok.

285
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,447
That's my son!

286
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,796
Stop filming!

287
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,214
-Move!
-Chief.

288
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,050
-Move aside!
-Damn it! Chief!

289
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,184
One moment, please.

290
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,897
This incident

291
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,192
stems from malicious intentions
to stop helicopter use

292
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,319
to reduce the hospital's deficit.

293
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,531
How much longer

294
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,325
must we let patients die because of money?

295
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,660
How much longer

296
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,455
must we let patients suffer
because of money?

297
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,416
And how much longer must the Trauma Center

298
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,754
be treated like a group of sinners
who cause budget deficits?

299
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,926
I can tolerate
being treated like a sinner.

300
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,388
But what I cannot tolerate…

301
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,316
is that patients

302
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,321
are the ones who end up
bearing the cost of all this.

303
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:47,227
Chief Hong Jae-hun of HNUH,
who accused Dr. Baek of malpractice,

304
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,271
has presented himself to the police today.

305
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,481
-He's here!
-Get him on camera.

306
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,240
Chief Hong!

307
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,117
Did you give those instructions?

308
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,119
-The helicopter--
-Please speak.

309
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,502
Do you wish to air any grievances?

310
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,879
Please say a few words.

311
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,047
This is injustice!

312
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,470
Dr. Baek has repeatedly undermined
the hospital's operations

313
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,014
with his arbitrary actions.

314
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,808
He dared to do so

315
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,227
because he was backed

316
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,898
by Minister Kang Myeong-hui
of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

317
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,734
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk

318
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,280
is nothing but a crony
strategically placed by Minister Kang!

319
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,533
You must never acknowledge it.

320
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,993
This is preposterous.

321
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,995
Ma'am.

322
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:51,291
You could say you were introduced
to Dr. Baek by Director Oh of Chilseong.

323
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,378
The allegations of cronyism
made by Chief Hong

324
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:58,257
are expected to be a major obstacle
for Minister Kang of Health and Welfare,

325
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,760
who is a potential presidential candidate.

326
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,178
Minister Kang Myeong-hui--

327
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,305
Ministry of Health and Welfare.

328
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,685
I have no comment at this time.
An official statement will be out soon.

329
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,436
I have nothing to say at this time.

330
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,690
Please wait for the official statement.
I'm ending the call now.

331
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,734
Ministry of Health and Welfare.
I have no comment--

332
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,487
Pardon?

333
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,076
"Future presidential candidate Kang
faces political hiccup."

334
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,081
People clean forgot about malpractice
amid the endless articles about cronyism.

335
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,792
This is getting more and more serious.

336
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,295
Dr. Baek. Shouldn't you step up
and clarify things?

337
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,005
Why me? Minister Kang should.

338
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,131
Minister Kang?

339
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,882
Why would she do that?

340
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,218
She's a political grand master.

341
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,055
Rather than give a clumsy excuse
that could backfire,

342
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,890
she'll probably just come clean.

343
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,808
What?

344
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,893
Will she admit to appointing a crony?

345
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,605
You're quite the opposite
of politically savvy, aren't you?

346
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,441
It's called sugarcoating.

347
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,235
You have to make it look pretty like this.

348
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,820
Sugarcoating?

349
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,322
Here. Look.

350
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,534
Rather than "cronyism,"
"We recruited an expert from outside."

351
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,577
Sounds pretty, right?

352
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,332
Is that even possible?

353
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,045
It's the minister.

354
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,841
This is Baek Kang-hyuk.

355
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,885
Dr. Baek. Please put the news on.

356
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:25,844
The news?

357
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,221
News.

358
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,682
Now to breaking news.

359
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:35,687
The Hanbit Unit in South Sudan
has been involved in a shooting.

360
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,647
Eleven members of the IMAFP,

361
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,902
who were engaged in relief
and medical efforts in South Sudan,

362
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,821
were nearly kidnapped by a local militia.

363
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,158
Soldiers from the Hanbit Unit,
a UN peacekeeping force deployed by Korea,

364
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,494
who were working
on a nearby road reconstruction

365
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,912
launched a rescue mission.

366
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,959
Our soldiers killed three militia rebels.

367
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,963
But Captain Lee Hyeon-jong
of the Hanbit Unit was shot.

368
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,341
He is reported to be
in critical condition.

369
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,096
The injured Captain Lee
was rushed to a local hospital,

370
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,600
but according to military sources,
his survival is not guaranteed at present.

371
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,811
We need your help, Dr. Baek.

372
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:21,191
I need you to go there immediately
and provide treatment.

373
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,943
Dr. Baek.

374
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,864
About those controversies
surrounding the two of us.

375
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,200
Let's face them head-on.

376
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,662
Sounds good.

377
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,835
What's all this?

378
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,169
You're actually going?

379
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,173
Well, I'm the gunshot wound expert.
I'll leave the Trauma Center to you.

380
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,468
Me?

381
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,387
You're the head of general surgery.

382
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,597
Should I ask
the head of internal medicine?

383
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,642
No. That's not right.
But I'm not right for it either.

384
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:59,104
Get the whole surgical team on board
and give it a go.

385
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,189
Oh dear.

386
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,649
I'm ready.

387
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,234
Good.

388
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,112
Let's see.

389
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,407
I have a nurse and an assistant doctor.

390
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,243
I have one spare seat.

391
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,501
CAPTAIN LEE HYEON-JONG SHOT AND INJURED

392
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,212
Let's go, Dr. Park.

393
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,653
I hear you've hand-picked
the crème de la crème.

394
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,490
You'll have no trouble
completing your task.

395
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:56,119
I've requested support from the airport
and on the ground in South Sudan.

396
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:00,290
Please make sure you save Captain Lee
and return triumphantly.

397
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,087
I'll be counting on you, Dr. Baek.

398
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,438
2 SHOTS, RIGHT ARM, HUMERUS FRACTURE
1 SHOT, LEFT ARM, RADIUS/ULNA FRACTURE

399
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,443
Two shots in the right arm.

400
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,871
Three in the abdomen.

401
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,041
Two of them went right through.

402
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,585
The last one is still lodged inside.

403
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,385
One in the left arm.
This one's lodged inside too.

404
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,601
Will he hold on until I get there?

405
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,024
I haven't prayed in a while.

406
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,486
Dear God.

407
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,282
Please believe in me.

408
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,546
Dr. Baek, isn't this a direct flight?

409
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,381
Have you never been to South Sudan?

410
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,425
My passport hasn't been stamped before.

411
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,030
MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

412
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,741
REQUESTING MEDICAL AID
FOR HANBIT UNIT IN SOUTH SUDAN

413
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,495
What is all this about?

414
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,331
Where did Baek Kang-hyuk go?

415
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,957
South Sudan--

416
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,251
Why are you just telling me this now?

417
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,796
The official request for cooperation
only just arrived.

418
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,424
The Ministry of National Defense
put in a request.

419
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,926
-So the Ministry of Health and Welfare--
-No way!

420
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,637
Stop them immediately!

421
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,388
No, never mind. I'll go myself.

422
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,811
Madam Minister.

423
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,272
Hello.

424
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,946
I'm here about Dr. Baek.

425
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,991
Yes, ma'am. I just received the report.

426
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,785
No. That's not why I'm here.

427
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,664
I want to get to the bottom of this.

428
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,168
How could you possibly use

429
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,923
budget deficits as an excuse
for stopping helicopter transfers?

430
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,094
I know nothing about that.

431
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,596
That makes it an even bigger issue!

432
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,348
You really should be in the know!

433
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,603
Regardless, there's no guarantee
that this won't happen again.

434
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,272
So I'm thinking about
accepting Dr. Baek's proposal.

435
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,819
I guess you're not even curious about it.

436
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,782
You are to construct a heliport
and launch an EMS helicopter service.

437
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,035
-Gross.
-What did you just say?

438
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,498
Our Dr. Baek promised he would bring
Captain Lee back alive at all costs

439
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,333
and asked me to carry the ball.

440
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:35,004
Of course, I also find it essential
for revitalizing the Trauma Center.

441
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,923
Madam Minister.

442
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,550
Go ahead!

443
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,677
This is really going too far!

444
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,221
This is external pressure.

445
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,472
External pressure.

446
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,851
We're finally on the same page.
That's right.

447
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,075
Hello. We're from the consulate.

448
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,286
-Thank you for coming.
-Let's go.

449
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,037
Something happened in the meantime.

450
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,582
Did something happen to Captain Lee?

451
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,000
No. I meant the hospital.

452
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,043
It was attacked last night.

453
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,721
One of the rebels that Captain Lee killed
was the ringleader's younger brother.

454
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,140
He's been on a rampage seeking revenge.

455
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:32,395
Attacking a UN military hospital
is no small matter.

456
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,274
Last night, we found a location
likely out of reach of the rebels

457
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,234
and transferred Captain Lee there.

458
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,154
Things are quite complicated here.

459
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,365
The prolonged civil war
has severely compromised public safety.

460
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,328
How is Captain Lee holding up?

461
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:52,957
The facilities are below par,
so he is in critical condition.

462
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,793
Let's just get there quickly.

463
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,517
This place is far too small
to be called a hospital.

464
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,854
Army surgeon Seo Dong-ju,
at your service, sir.

465
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,397
The patient?

466
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,607
I'll lead the way.

467
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:39,379
Necrotizing fasciitis, various infections,
and multiple organ failure.

468
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,966
The bullets causing the infection
are still inside,

469
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,718
so even with antibiotics,
he seems to be getting worse.

470
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,345
He has signs of anemia too.

471
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,474
Why is the blood transfusion rate so low?
It's nearly at the minimum.

472
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,269
We don't have enough blood, sir.

473
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,313
What do you mean?

474
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,817
During the attack,
the supply room caught fire,

475
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,819
and all the blood supplies were lost.

476
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,196
We did bring a few units,
but it's far from enough.

477
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,281
That's serious.

478
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,285
And Dr. Baek.

479
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,164
You can see that the color
around his abdominal organs is changing.

480
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,250
Maybe you should start there.

481
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,376
That's long gone.

482
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,337
Without sufficient blood,
even I can't fix it.

483
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,633
Let's start by controlling the infection
in his arms and legs.

484
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,718
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

485
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,598
Necrotic change.

486
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,684
The necrosis already looks quite advanced.

487
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,895
What do we do, Dr. Baek?

488
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,812
Dr. Baek.

489
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,566
I think, for us to keep him alive,

490
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,818
amputation is our best bet.

491
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,736
Amputation?

492
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,196
Under such poor conditions?

493
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,034
It'll only put him at greater risk.
You can't, Dr. Baek.

494
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,579
Prep for surgery.

495
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,540
Get ready and move the patient.

496
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,458
Yes, Doctor.

497
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,792
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

498
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:12,430
Breaking news. Captain Lee Hyeon-jong
is in critical condition.

499
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,600
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk,
who began operating upon arrival,

500
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,226
was hailed a national hero

501
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,647
for saving three severely injured patients
from the Sowol Bridge accident.

502
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,026
He was implicated in allegations
that his appointment

503
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,695
as Head of Trauma Center at HNUH
was due to cronyism.

504
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,908
But Minister Kang of Health and Welfare,
who recommended Dr. Baek,

505
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,828
has denied claims of cronyism
and repeatedly emphasized his expertise.

506
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:40,291
It's been reported that Dr. Baek
began operating upon arrival.

507
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:45,296
The public is focusing its attention
on whether Captain Lee can be saved.

508
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm bleeding. Bleeding, I tell you!

509
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,381
Dr. Han. You must do something!

510
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,678
Dr. Baek said to tell you this
if you look lost.

511
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,599
You've got this!

512
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,440
I am

513
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,275
Baek Kang-hyuk.

514
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,571
I am Baek Kang-hyuk!

515
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,160
I am Baek Kang-hyuk!

516
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,996
Fuck! It hurts like hell! Come on!

517
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,123
Shut up! I'll save you!

518
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,750
-Agnes.
-Yes, sir.

519
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,461
This patient needs an EKG
and Hartmann's solution.

520
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,713
For him, get a neurosurgical consultation.

521
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,465
Take him to CT! Quick!

522
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,675
Shut up, you filthy thugs!

523
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,344
I said shut up!

524
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,430
Shut up!

525
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,766
I am Baek Kang-hyuk, you bastards!

526
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,894
If you shut up, you live.
If you don't, you die.

527
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,690
Scalpel.

528
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:34,280
NAME: LEE HYEON-JONG, GENDER: MALE
NECROTIZING FASCIITIS/BULLET REMOVAL

529
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,496
Mosquito.

530
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,225
Betadine.

531
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,607
Saline.

532
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,244
-Dr. Park, his vitals?
-We can't afford any more bleeding.

533
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,788
We've only just got through one arm.

534
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,917
Dr. Baek.

535
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,670
The necrosis is spreading.

536
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,511
We have two units of blood left.

537
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,680
Let's use one now.

538
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,933
Please give me the blood bag.

539
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,146
Dr. Baek.

540
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,524
What are you thinking?

541
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,963
For now, we should observe him
for a little longer and think about…

542
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,132
For how long?

543
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,177
Until the patient dies?

544
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,558
Hold him.

545
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,915
"Air ambulance"?

546
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,250
It's an official request from Dr. Baek.

547
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,212
He said it was the only way
to save Captain Lee.

548
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,131
-Look into it as quickly as possible.
-Yes, ma'am.

549
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,143
TO MINISTER KANG MYEONG-HUI:
PLEASE CONTACT ME. HOW DID IT GO?

550
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,397
What the fuck are they waiting for?
Damn it.

551
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,359
Dr. Baek.

552
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,239
Thank you for your hard work.

553
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:26,160
Seeing you work so hard
to save the patient was truly moving.

554
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,536
I don't know about "moving."

555
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,665
You did much more, Dr. Seo Dong-ju.

556
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,875
I heard you didn't get a wink of sleep.

557
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,711
It's nothing. I just did my job.

558
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,340
You have a flair for trauma surgery.

559
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,176
Pardon?

560
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,179
Come see me once you're discharged.
I'll buy you jjajangmyeon.

561
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,015
Dr. Baek!

562
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,185
-Dr. Baek.
-Have they responded?

563
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,520
As for your request,

564
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,314
the relevant departments
are having a video conference soon.

565
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,984
Time is running out,
and they want a conference?

566
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,736
Hasn't the successful surgery
bought us some time?

567
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:05,533
Given his condition,
he could die at any moment.

568
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,219
He's just in such a bad state.

569
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,683
We haven't even touched his abdomen,
and we're out of blood.

570
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,029
He needs to be transferred immediately.
It's serious.

571
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,947
The Ministry of National Defense

572
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,700
is checking if a cargo plane
can carry medical equipment.

573
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,659
It will take…

574
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,078
-How long?
-About two weeks, sir.

575
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,621
Two weeks.

576
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,041
We can use that to transport the corpse.

577
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,208
Transport the corpse?

578
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,877
Watch your language!

579
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,171
We are doing the best we can.

580
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,548
We've asked to have the seats removed--

581
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,508
Damn it! That's not what I need!

582
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,136
I need an air ambulance!

583
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,721
What is that?

584
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,391
-It's a plane for transporting patients.
-Is there such a thing?

585
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,144
Look, Dr. Baek.

586
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,565
The air ambulance will not be feasible.

587
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,942
We have some issues with costs.

588
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,529
The best we can manage
is between 300 and 500 million won.

589
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,617
But an air ambulance would cost
at least 700 to 800 million.

590
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,286
Is money seriously an issue right now?

591
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,414
We're talking about a man

592
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,583
who is on his deathbed
from serving his country.

593
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,258
Hello?

594
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,095
Yes, Director Choi.

595
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,182
Is Captain Lee Hyeon-jong all right?

596
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,020
We can't guarantee his recovery for sure.

597
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,606
That sounds like

598
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,359
we should be preparing for the worst.

599
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,904
If he were to pass away,

600
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,824
we would need to establish
who is responsible.

601
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,702
I heard you performed surgery today.

602
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,831
How did Dr. Baek treat the patient?

603
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,085
Was there anything
that might have put the patient in danger?

604
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,628
The left arm was…

605
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,217
We only managed to remove
infected tissues.

606
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,345
It's difficult to go further
without blood.

607
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,475
All right. I understand.

608
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,562
Please continue to keep a close watch.

609
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,397
All right, Director Choi.

610
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,446
Doc.

611
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,075
Were you just on the phone
with the director?

612
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,871
-This is not--
-What is this?

613
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,040
Have you been reporting back
to the director this whole time?

614
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,042
Just hear me out.

615
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,586
No. Never mind.

616
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,089
Tell Dr. Baek yourself before I do.

617
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,302
Wait…

618
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,845
Nurse Cheon.

619
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,096
Wait. Nurse Cheon!

620
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,640
Let me explain myself. So…

621
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,350
Forget it.

622
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,519
Nurse Cheon!

623
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,229
Oh God!

624
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,106
Captain Lee Hyeon-jong.

625
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,318
-What about him?
-Quickly! Hurry!

626
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,071
Give me that.

627
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,243
How is he doing?

628
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,913
-I'm not sure.
-First…

629
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,583
-We need more units of blood.
-We don't have any.

630
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,210
What do we do?

631
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,127
You're right.

632
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,050
Dr. Baek.
Captain Lee is in critical condition.

633
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,681
I'll run over
and find out what's going on.

634
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,766
Halt!

635
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,684
Stay put. He said "critical."

636
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,269
We must prepare for his death.

637
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,979
Pardon?

638
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,942
-What happened?
-Well…

639
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,778
We're using Nurse Cheon's blood.

640
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,821
Damn it.

641
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,539
His BP's gone up a bit,
but it's still unstable.

642
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,884
-We're transporting the patient.
-Wait, Dr. Baek. Transport him?

643
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,929
-He won't hold out any longer.
-No.

644
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,556
That's not an option.

645
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,474
You might get attacked. It's too risky.

646
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,476
-Get moving.
-Yes, sir.

647
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,270
Dr. Baek.

648
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,777
Dr. Baek, this doesn't seem right.

649
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,197
-We should at least request an escort.
-There's no time.

650
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,950
Then I'm coming with you.

651
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,160
Your company will only complicate things.

652
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,245
Dr. Baek!

653
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,788
Dr. Seo.

654
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,542
You've done a terrific job.
Leave the rest to us.

655
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,668
But…

656
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,611
How is he doing?

657
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,199
He's doing all right for now, but

658
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,160
we're running out of blood, Dr. Baek.

659
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,582
-I'll transfuse another unit.
-What?

660
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,916
No, you can't!

661
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,959
It's all right.

662
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,420
But you've already given
500 milliliters. Stop.

663
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,547
It's okay. There's no other way.

664
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,980
Stop the car, or we will open fire!

665
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,041
Dr. Baek. His BP's dropping!

666
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,042
50 over 30!

667
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,837
-Let me transfuse directly.
-What?

668
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,338
No. You can't!

669
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,799
-It's too dangerous.
-We'll lose him otherwise!

670
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,097
-Dr. Baek!
-Dr. Baek. Hurry!

671
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,604
Dr. Baek. BP is dropping further!

672
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,314
We're going to lose the patient!

673
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,690
Dr. Baek!

674
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,109
-What do we do?
-I'll transfuse the blood!

675
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:25,957
