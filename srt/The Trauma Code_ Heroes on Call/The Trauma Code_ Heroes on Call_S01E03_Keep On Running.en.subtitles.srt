00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,246
Are you a zombie or what?

5
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,628
Are you dead?

6
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
Are you finished?

7
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,550
All right, you're still alive.

8
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,519
Anus, keep it down.

9
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,653
-Not again!
-What is it?

10
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,614
The audit team sent a warning email.

FW: BUDGET CUTS WARNING FOR TRAUMA CENTER

12
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,201
Dr. Baek's sure gone all out.

13
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,997
I know you can't just ignore the red ink,
but this is a hospital after all.

14
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,252
Hello, Trauma Team.

15
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,640
Yang Jae-won of trauma surgery.

16
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,810
Dr. Yang, there's been a pile-up.
Get here fast!

17
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,895
I'm on my way.

18
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,607
Dr. Baek, you need to wake up.

19
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,817
Patients?

20
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,988
Yes, the ambulance is on its way.

21
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,031
Start running.

22
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,120
-Sorry!
-Dr. Baek!

23
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,039
At this rate, I might drop dead first.

24
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,957
-Should I make that happen?
-No, sir!

25
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,960
What a great runner.

26
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,879
Let's start prepping.

27
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,964
-Dr. Baek will be here any minute.
-Okay!

28
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,551
Are you okay?

29
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,928
-Yes.
-I'm sorry.

30
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,850
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

31
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,524
Hey, Gangster.

32
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,109
So what happened?

33
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,654
-Don't call me that.
-Shut up and fill me in.

34
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,823
A dump truck crashed into a car.

35
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,496
They suspect driver fatigue.

36
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,498
It happened inside a tunnel on a wet road,

37
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,252
so the car's front seats
took most of the damage.

38
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,337
The patients are being transported here.

REGIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

40
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:19,884
Let's see.

41
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,679
Dr. Yang, his stomach…

42
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,306
It's hemoperitoneum. It's too severe.

43
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,891
-Hey!
-Yes?

44
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,685
-To the resuscitation room. Now!
-Yes.

45
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,981
How long has he been out?

46
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,190
Around 15 minutes.

47
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:38,861
Thanks.

48
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,286
Insert an A-line and take him to the OR.

49
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,830
-I'll get the A-line.
-Dr. Baek, we have another patient.

50
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,292
All right, make way.

51
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,501
-Over here.
-All right.

52
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,336
-Right.
-Okay.

53
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,133
-Scissors.
-Here.

54
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,177
Dr. Baek, we're taking him to surgery.

55
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,263
-Tell Anus I'll be right there!
-Yes, sir!

56
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,533
Please administer anesthesia.

57
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,784
All right.

58
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,166
-Dr. Hwang.
-Yes?

59
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,626
Could you please speed up a bit?

60
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,544
Look, Dr. Yang.

61
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,715
I already feel incredibly uncomfortable
performing anesthesia without any tests.

62
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,760
And rushing me like this is going too far.

63
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,679
All I'm saying is,
since the patient is in critical--

64
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,181
Okay, fine.

65
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,307
Leave it to me.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,892
Just stay out of the way.

67
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,143
Excuse me, Doc.

68
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,521
Can't you see the state he's in?
He's on his 12th unit of blood.

69
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,774
Will you take the blame
if the patient dies?

70
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,610
Wait.

71
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,321
-What is that thing even saying?
-"That thing"?

72
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,031
-"That thing"?
-Yeah.

73
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,451
Some of us are going flat out
trying to save a life.

74
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,495
-And you insult me, you lazy ass?
-What?

75
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,454
"Lazy ass"?

76
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,081
-Did you hear that?
-Calm down.

77
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,040
What did you say?

78
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,458
I want to save lives too!

79
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,001
This calls for more than words!

80
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,628
-Cut it out!
-Dr. Hwang!

81
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,131
All right, I'll get right on it
and complete the anesthesia.

82
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,049
In return,

83
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,842
give me her name.

84
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,011
I'll be filing a formal complaint.

85
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,721
-Stop it.
-I'll make her pay.

86
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,473
She's glaring! What's your name?

87
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,933
-What?
-Give me your name!

88
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,059
Hey, Anesthetics.

89
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,852
What's the problem?

90
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,062
What's your name?

91
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:36,979
Sir?

92
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,607
Don't ask questions you can't answer.

93
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,027
Prep properly if you don't want
to get into trouble. Understood?

94
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,113
Yes, sir. I'll get started right away!

95
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,739
I'll go scrub in.

96
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,370
-Hey, Gangster.
-Yes?

97
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,415
Don't you know what matters
in front of a patient?

98
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,792
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,337
Don't pick fights with just anyone.

100
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,881
Leave the fighting

101
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,341
to me.

102
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,430
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,102
What do you think of Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk?

104
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,773
I don't know him well enough
to make a judgment.

105
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,902
I just want your honest opinion.

106
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,488
As an anesthesiology resident,

107
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,199
you encounter all sorts of surgeons,
don't you?

108
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,453
Dr. Baek is…

109
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
He is a monster.

110
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,960
He performed an intercranial decompression

111
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,171
and partial lung resection
in under two hours.

112
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,840
Well, need I say more?

113
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,925
I see.

114
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,344
His skills are indeed remarkable.

115
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,097
Unfortunately, though,

116
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,016
that kind of individual genius

117
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,769
can sometimes be harmful
to the organization.

118
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,650
And on that note,

119
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,362
if you help me out a little here,
Dr. Park,

120
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:13,242
I'll have plenty to repay you for later.

121
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,416
Are you asking me to be a mole?

122
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,339
Oh my, the moon is so bright, isn't it?

123
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,014
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

124

NAME: LEE GI-YEONG, GENDER: MALE
HEMOPERITONEUM

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,316
Irrigation.

126
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,404
BP is dropping, moron!

127
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,281
-Inotropics! Quick!
-Yes, sir!

128
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,824
-Warm saline, please.
-Okay.

129
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,039
-Anus, suction. Focus!
-Yes, sir.

130
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,543
-Inotropics in.
-Get 30 more units of blood.

131
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,253
-Speed up the transfusion.
-On it.

132
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,965
Dr. Baek, we're losing too much blood.

133
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,841
We must find the source quickly.

134
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,557
BP is still dropping. It's 60 over 40.

135
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,850
Dr. Baek?

136
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,271
Dr. Baek, what do we do next?

137
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,194
Dr. Baek!
We'll lose the patient at this rate!

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,574
This much bleeding means it's an artery.

139
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,534
Dr. Baek!

140
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,244
Where is it?

141
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,246
Where?

142
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,081
Where are you?

143
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,586
I've found it.

144
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,802
Suture. Quickly! It's slippery.

145
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,682
How did you find that?

146
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,684
I didn't see anything.

147
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,270
Suction. Stay focused!
I'm not flying solo here!

148
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,396
Yes, Doctor.

149
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,001
The superior mesenteric artery
was damaged.

150
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,212
Anus, place the omni retractor
and cauterize all bleeding.

151
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,213
Yes, sir.

152
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,890
But what do we do about the liver?

153
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,309
I can't cauterize all of this.

154
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,062
The damage seems worse than expected.

155
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,731
We'll need to resect 80% of it
to control the bleeding.

156
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,067
A liver rupture…

157
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,944
Damn, he's even had liver cirrhosis.

158
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,030
It's at least a Class B.

159
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,366
That means his liver function
is next to zero.

160
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,326
If we control the bleeding,

161
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,787
will he survive?

162
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,997
The chances are slim. Gauze.

163
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,130
Then…

164
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,219
don't you think
we should just close him up now?

165
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,722
Medicine is all about probability.
Death is never a certainty.

166
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,393
We'll only buy him a few more hours.
You know that.

167
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,103
Nobody will give us credit anyway.

168
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,027
Could we try something else?

169
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,029
What the heck does she know?

170
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,448
What, is she a doctor now?

171
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,867
Could you please watch your mouth?

172
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,160
Sorry?

173
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,995
That's Nurse Cheon Jang-mi.

174
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,249
She's a fifth-year senior
who has been here since Dr. Kwon's time.

175
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,960
She's probably seen
more trauma cases than anyone.

176
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,796
She's more experienced than either of us.

177
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,258
Please show her some respect.

178
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,221
Having fun, are we?

179
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,639
Are you done?

180
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,558
-Sorry, Doctor.
-I'm sorry.

181
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,018
Gangster.

182
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,271
What do you suggest we do?

183
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,357
What if he got a donor liver?

184
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,650
Whose liver would that be?

185
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,944
Yours? Mine? His?

186
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,241
Dr. Baek, earlier today,
I ran into an organ donor coordinator.

187
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,619
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,877
ORGAN AND TISSUE DONOR CONSENT FORM

189
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,879
If they're here at this hour,

190
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,381
it means a registered donor
is declared brain-dead, so--

191
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,216
What are you waiting for? Call them.

192
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,134
Yes, Doctor.

193
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,440
This is Kang Chang-su.

194
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,275
We urgently need a liver transplant.

195
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,320
Is there any possibility?
There's a brain-dead donor, right?

196
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,988
Has the surgery already begun?

197
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,906
Well,

198
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,241
everything has been put on hold.

199
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,369
We've lost contact with their next of kin.

200
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,747
We're just waiting for them to call.

201
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,792
You know the drill.
We need their consent to proceed.

202
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,335
Give me the address.

203
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,836
Pardon?

204
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,254
Who was that?

205
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,090
We'll send someone to get their consent.

206
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,842
-Give me the address.
-I can't.

207
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,177
It's illegal.

208
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,138
Forget the law.
Saving a life comes first, doesn't it?

209
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,974
Dr. Baek, why don't we check
their blood type first?

210
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,019
Unless the donor is type O,
the consent will come to nothing.

211
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,771
Mr. Lee Gi-yeong is type O, so…

212
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,980
Hang on.

213
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,774
What did you say their name was?

214
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,275
Oh, the patient?

215
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,110
The patient's name is Lee Gi-yeong.

216
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,533
NEXT OF KIN INFORMATION: LEE GI-YEONG, SON
LEE HYE-YEONG, DAUGHTER

217
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,118
The donor's son's name on our file

218
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,870
is the same as your patient's.

219
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,332
Just a moment.

220
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,922
Is the date of birth July 12, 1988?

221
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,007
That's correct.

222
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,927
You don't think…

223
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,930
He's the donor's family?

224
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:18,941
Hold on.

225
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,527
Could that woman be…

226
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,157
There was someone in the passenger seat.

227
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,617
Do you know who it is?

228
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,327
It's probably

229
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,913
the daughter, Lee Hye-yeong.

230
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,835
So the two siblings were on their way here

231
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,880
to see their father, the brain-dead donor,

232
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,382
when they got into an accident.

233
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,811
Good.

234
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,607
Can you confirm that the donor is type O?

235
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,609
Yes, that's correct, but…

236
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,904
Then it'll be a transplant
between family members.

237
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,863
Pardon?

238
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,116
-But it's illegal without consent--
-Hey!

239
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,453
The next of kin are unconscious,
so who do you expect to give consent?!

240
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,872
Mr. Lee Gi-yeong will die
without that liver!

241
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,916
We'll add him to the wait list and--

242
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,542
Are you kidding me?!

243
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,962
Do you want us to do the transplant
on a dead patient?!

244
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,718
We'll go ahead with the liver transplant.

245
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,847
If any issues arise from this,

246
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,225
I will take full responsibility.

247
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,982
I understand.

248
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,776
I'll put a rush on it.

249
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,529
One more thing.

250
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,282
I need a favor.

251
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,665
We'll proceed
with the patient's organ donation today.

252
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,375
They'll transplant the liver now.

253
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,127
Contact the recipients
of the other organs.

254
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,797
-Yes, sir.
-One more thing.

255
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,218
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk made a request.

256
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,929
It's our lucky day.

257
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,308
We came so close to losing this patient,
but now he has a donor liver.

258
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,727
Even so, how could you say such a…

259
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,896
Can you save a brain-dead man?

260
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,814
Sir?

261
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:23,983
Answer me.

262
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,112
No, I can't.

263
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,823
I can save Mr. Lee Gi-yeong.

264
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,660
Then what do you think
is the right choice?

265
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,996
I'm sorry, sir.

266
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,877
I'm going to save him, no matter what,

267
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,423
to make sure that the donor

268
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,466
can pass away in peace.

269
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,723
You may begin.

270
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,184
Let's have a moment of silence.

271
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,061
Okay.

272
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,522
Dr. Baek, that was barely a second.

273
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,690
He will understand.

274
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,985
He'd care more about saving his child
than our silent prayer.

275
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,903
Scalpel.

276
00:17:55,866 --> 00:18:02,498
NAME: LEE JI-YEONG, GENDER: MALE
ORGAN DONATION

277
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,086
One more.

278
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,112
All set.

279
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,076
Why are you running?

280
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,120
We have another patient, Lee Hye-yeong.

281
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,914
Dr. Baek! Wait a second!

282
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:27,833
What is it?

283
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,917
Damn it.

284
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,713
I need to tell him about the warning email
from the audit team.

285
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,340
Oh dear.

286
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,720
That female patient from earlier,
which OR is she in?

287
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,930
She's in OR 27 in the main building.

288
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,724
-Okay, 27.
-Yes.

289
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,226
-Dr. Jung Jun-su is treating her!
-Sorry?

290
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,440
Dr. Baek, wait a second.

291
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,153
She's been moved to orthopedics,
so she's not with us now.

292
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,113
What? She's a major trauma patient. Move.

293
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,157
-Well, the thing is…
-What now?

294
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,660
Dr. Jung Jun-su,
the one in the surgery, is a little…

295
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,497
He is one of your kind.

296
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,415
What?

297
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
-Is he a genius?
-Yes.

298
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,210
What?

299
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,252
No, that's not…

300
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,879
What I mean is,

301
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
he's a little

302
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,675
intense.

303
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,513
Fine, no fighting.
I'll just check one thing. Move.

304
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,145
Hold it properly, damn it!

305
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,819
-What the heck?
-Wrong name.

306
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,322
I'm Baek Kang-hyuk of trauma surgery.

307
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,907
I just need to check something.

308
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,785
That Dr. Baek.

309
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,996
I've heard a lot about you from Dr. Han.

310
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,292
How dare he steal my protégé?!

311
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,754
Chewing him up wouldn't even be enough!

312
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,465
DIE, BAEK KANG-HYUK

313
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,676
My teacup!

314
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,887
Baek Kang-hyuk!

315
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,476
I heard you triaged her.
Are you here to follow up?

316
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,313
Couldn't you have done a better job
to begin with?

317
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,274
Just look at this. It's a complete mess.

318
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,359
This is a difficult case.

319
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,862
Are there ever any easy ones?

320
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,572
It's up to you to do a good job.

321
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,119
What the hell, kid?

322
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,664
If I were your kid,

323
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,125
I'd be a son of a bitch.

324
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,710
Why, this little bastard…

325
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,004
Dr. Jung, please contain yourself.

326
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:41,216
Another act of violence,
and the board won't let you off.

327
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,761
Damn it.

328
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,596
Open it wider, asshole.

329
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,644
Her creatine has really spiked.

330
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,731
Nurse? What's the patient's I/O like?

331
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,359
Fluids and blood transfusions
total around 2,000 cc,

332
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,528
but there hasn't been any urine output.

333
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,989
There's no kidney function at all.

334
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,117
Yes. She's already getting hydronephrosis.

335
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,369
Lab results show
that uremia has set in too.

336
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,664
Is she going to the nephrology ward?

337
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,460
Yes. Dr. Shin Jeong-u of nephrology
is on his way here.

338
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,507
Shin Jeong-u here.

339
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,176
Baek Kang-hyuk of trauma surgery.

340
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,219
-Oh.
-Lee Hye-yeong is your patient, right?

341
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,556
-Lee Hye-yeong?
-Yes. What is your care plan?

342
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,644
I'll put her on dialysis
and monitor her lab results.

343
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,481
That is a death sentence,

344
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,026
especially for a trauma patient
with acute renal failure.

345
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,030
I know, but I'm at a dead end.
I can't exactly find a kidney somewhere.

346
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:45,989
As for that,

347
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,367
I've already secured one.

348
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,038
One more thing. I need a favor.

349
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,751
Along with that liver,
please save a kidney for me.

350
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,087
I have the feeling

351
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,839
that Lee Hye-yeong
has acute renal failure.

352
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,847
I'll get to the transplant right away.
Could you begin dialysis in the OR?

353
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,281
The kidney is here.

354
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,495
I've heard all about that kidney.

355
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,498
The donor is Lee Hye-yeong's father.

356
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,584
I'll leave the dialysis in your hands.

357
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:41,878
I'll begin now.

358
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,095
-Anus.
-Yes?

359
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,389
The patient is in a very bad state.

360
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,224
Let's give ourselves 30 minutes.

361
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,851
Yes, Dr. Baek.

362
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,562
A kidney transplant in 30 minutes?

363
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,440
You're one big bluffer.

364
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,068
Scalpel.

365
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:10,699
NAME: LEE HYE-YEONG, GENDER: FEMALE
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT

366
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,956
3-0.

367
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,309
Now cut.

368
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,729
Okay. Done.

369
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,690
That took exactly 24 minutes.

370
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,248
I know, I'm amazing.
Tell me something new. Let's go.

371
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,584
After you.

372
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,214
Hey.

373
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,758
How can you yawn in this situation?

374
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,594
But we're all done now.

375
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,473
I thought you were a well-mannered kid.
I guess I was wrong.

376
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,184
Come with me. We have somewhere to be.

377
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,645
-Where?
-Just come.

378
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,163
Let's have a moment of silence.

379
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,251
Didn't we do that earlier?

380
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,795
That was a short version.

381
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,505
This time it's formal.

382
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,507
We should do it properly.

383
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,679
How thoughtless of me.

384
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,848
Organ donation is a noble sacrifice.

385
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,476
Let us pay

386
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,479
proper respect.

387
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,068
Thank you.

388
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,238
Rest in peace.

389
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,271
I'm tired.

390
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,739
-Wake up!
-Yes, Dr. Baek!

391
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,699
Oh my.

392
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,952
You'll have to try harder
to crack your skull.

393
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,911
Sorry, Doctor.

394
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,080
Are you leaving?

395
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,498
Yes, outpatient appointments.

396
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,752
-Let's do the ICU rounds after lunch.
-Sure.

397
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,972
Did I sleep?

398
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,141
Hey, Anus!

399
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,020
He called him "Anus."

400
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,272
You

401
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,066
are just pure evil.

402
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,901
Why? I got it right, didn't I?

403
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,569
Isn't that your official title?

404
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,660
I've been in trauma surgery all this time,
and he still calls me Anus!

405
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,622
Hey.

406
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,833
I guess it's not all that bad.
It's been a month already.

407
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,044
What do you think?

408
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,631
Guess what I hear all the time nowadays.

409
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,882
Number one, "Hey, Anus."

410
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,425
Number two, "Start running."

411
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,762
Number three, "What do you think?
That was so easy, right?"

412
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,139
It's easy to remove a liver
and then transplant it.

413
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,893
It's easy to sew up a shredded artery.
Even cardiotomy is easy for him.

414
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,103
Is any of that

415
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,063
easy?

416
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,527
Dr. Baek must be the type
to toot his own horn.

417
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,530
If that were the case,
I would keep my mouth closed.

418
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,656
The truth is,

419
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,450
he truly finds these things easy.

420
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,166
Is there something wrong with me?

421
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,836
Not at all.
Everything is completely normal.

422
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,088
The same goes for your liver.

423
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,297
Everything looks clean.

424
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,967
Come back in six months.

425
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,554
If all is well then,
you won't need to see my face again.

426
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,808
Thank you so much.
I never got to thank you properly.

427
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,353
I was so out of it in the helicopter.

428
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,939
If you want to show your gratitude,

429
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,191
why don't you do me a favor?

430
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,360
A favor?

431
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,283
One, two, three!

432
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,043
You're the first doctor
to ask me for a picture.

433
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,463
It's both to document and to commemorate.

434
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,384
Thank you for everything.

435
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,307
I might as well put them on display.
If not, no one would ever notice.

436
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,975
I should let them know.

437
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,483
Dr. Baek!

438
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,573
That brat! He is not with his outpatients.
Where on earth is he?

439
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,408
Damn it.

440
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,459
Hey, Anus.

441
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,336
Yes?

442
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,047
Is this your first time
seeing a liver transplant patient?

443
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,673
Yes, sir.

444
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,092
And you, Gangster?

445
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:04,969
Yes, same here.

446
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,641
So you will be handling
post-transplant care for the first time?

447
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,142
Yes.

448
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,729
What am I gonna do?

449
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,898
How am I ever gonna teach this lot

450
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,691
to start pulling their own weight?

451
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,743
By the way, Dr. Baek,
I tried to tell you earlier…

452
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,747
What? Why?

453
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,457
Am I in the dark here?

454
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,125
The thing is…

455
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,504
Budget cuts?

456
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,091
Budget cuts, my ass.

457
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,218
Since you joined us,

458
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,596
the audit team has sent
over ten warning emails.

459
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,056
Wait, so,

460
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,601
what is the review service's excuse
for these budget cuts?

461
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,520
They have a baseline, not an excuse.

462
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,482
Go over it and your budget gets cut.
If not, it's payday. You know that.

463
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm saying that the baseline is all wrong.

464
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,904
I sent them a whole compilation
of theses and case reports.

465
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,867
I understand where you're coming from.

466
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,081
But I am the epitome of this Trauma Team.

467
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,209
A senior nurse
with a mere five years' experience.

468
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,045
I wouldn't be a senior anywhere else.

469
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,757
This is just a hollow shell
that was made to barely function.

470
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,675
So,

471
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,555
how do you think we've managed
to stay afloat despite everything?

472
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,642
We would bow down
to the director's office,

473
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,352
grovel to the board of directors,

474
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,229
and plead with the review board.

475
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,898
That's how we stuck it out.

476
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,441
That's how we survived.

477
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,027
Well done. Good job.

478
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,904
Are you fishing for compliments?

479
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,492
If you keep this up,
this team will fall apart.

480
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,161
I want to protect our team.

481
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,245
Gangster.

482
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,916
What do you mean "protect"? We just--

483
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,917
Dr. Baek!

484
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,544
There you are!

485
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,548
How are you doing?

486
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,885
What's the occasion?

487
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,929
Come with me.

488
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,597
Where to?

489
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,390
You'll find out when we get there!

490
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,518
I'd like to know before I go.

491
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,815
Seriously. Damn it.

492
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,408
My apologies.

493
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,125
You all took time
out of your busy schedules to be here,

494
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,877
but today's meeting…

495
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,546
It was canceled because of you!
Do you realize that?

496
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,466
As far as I know,
those meetings aren't mandatory.

497
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,592
Hey!

498
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,135
Come on, Dr. Han.

499
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,263
Listen, Dr. Baek.

500
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:58,810
I sent out text messages and emails
asking all attendings to make time

501
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,687
for this week's meeting.

502
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,938
Yes, I saw them.

503
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:02,897
Then I forgot.

504
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,527
I guess that can happen.

505
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,612
That I understand.

506
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,072
But this?

507
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,618
The trauma surgery department's deficit

508
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,079
has exceeded 300 million won.

509
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,999
This I can't just let go.

510
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:26,212
Can't we cover around 300 million won
with the government subsidies?

511
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,178
I can't believe this guy.

512
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,097
That money

513
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,809
goes toward the center's maintenance
and equipment purchases.

514
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,604
It is not intended
to cover deficits like this.

515
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,276
I don't think that's the intended purpose.
You should use it correctly.

516
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,655
While we're at it,
let's talk about the Trauma Center ICU.

517
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,200
It's been a stopgap
for the main ICU's overflow.

518
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,828
At the moment,
in a room with only three beds,

519
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,664
there is one trauma patient
and two from internal medicine.

520
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,417
All patients are treated equally.
Stop splitting hairs!

521
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,918
I don't think so.

522
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,298
Using money meant for trauma patients
on something else,

523
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,467
isn't that basically fraud?

524
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,634
Watch it.

525
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,804
If we get flagged by the review service
and face a special audit,

526
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,056
forget 300 million won,

527
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,516
we could be out tens of billions of won.

528
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,769
If that worries you,
stop the overtreatment.

529
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,687
The attendings are so money-hungry!

530
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,022
Dr. Baek!

531
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,442
That pie hole of yours
doesn't have a filter, does it?

532
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,818
My apologies!

533
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,113
In any case,

534
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,824
don't hassle me about the deficit again.

535
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,202
Excuse me.
I need to get back to saving lives.

536
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,789
I dare you to leave!

537
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,457
Don't you dare open that door!

538
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,416
Hey! Stop!

539
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,835
What? You're leaving?! Really?!

540
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,796
I saw that look you gave me!

541
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,631
You little brat, get back here!

542
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,091
That bastard…

543
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,552
Yu-rim.

544
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,678
Yes, Doc.

545
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,766
That bastard is good for nothing.

546
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,643
He's a pit bull.

547
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,811
I know.

548
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,939
We can't just let him be.
He'll get us into deep trouble.

549
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,192
The board of directors
will not stand for this deficit.

550
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,571
My chance of being the next director
would be gone.

551
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,828
As would your chance of being
the chief of planning and coordination.

552
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,706
That just cannot be.

553
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,542
Doc.

554
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,919
Leave it to me, Doc.

555
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,963
Let me handle this, okay?

556
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,382
Everyone has skeletons
in the closet, right?

557
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,801
Trust me with this, Doc.

558
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,226
Hi, Dr. Yoon.
I heard you were back in Korea.

559
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,062
We should catch up over dinner.

560
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,439
You spent a long time

561
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,151
with the International Medical Association
for Peace.

562
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,820
Could you look into something for me?

563
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,322
All right.

564
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,908
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
NAME: LEE HYE-YEONG

565
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,717
By the way,

566
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,136
do you think it'll be okay?

567
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,097
The swelling is slow to go down.

568
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,391
She'll be fine, I'm sure.
We'll have to wait.

569
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,102
No, not that.

570
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,856
The chief of planning and coordination
summoned you.

571
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,526
What do you care?
You're being presumptuous.

572
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,237
I know I am, but it worries me, Dr. Baek.

573
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,155
Hey, Anus.

574
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,824
Doctors are never in the wrong
for saving lives.

575
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,909
That's just a given.

576
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,161
All that stuff
about our deficit or whatever,

577
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,287
just ignore it.

578
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,539
Yes, sir.

579
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,463
This won't do.

580
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,590
My treat tonight. Let's eat out.

581
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,135
-Out?
-Yes.

582
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,138
-Outside the hospital?
-And…

583
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,474
Yes?

584
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,727
Make sure to pass my message on
to Gangster.

585
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,772
What message?

586
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,486
Excuse me?

587
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,780
He wants you to come out
looking half-decent.

588
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,409
Fine, got it.

589
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,579
I can't believe this.

590
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,250
I just don't bother to doll up,
but when I do…

591
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,216
As long as I'm not naked, it's fine.

592
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,970
What should I wear?

593
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,520
TV shows are so unrealistic.
No real-life doctor is that good-looking.

594
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,803
Dr. Baek!

595
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,929
Oh my God!

596
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,474
I'm sorry I'm late.

597
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,600
Wow, Anus.

598
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,186
You look like a whole new person.

599
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,565
I'm known for being relatively stylish
at the hospital.

600
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,108
Is it your empty stomach talking?

601
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,151
Joke much?

602
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,612
Actually, someone bought me
the whole outfit.

603
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,448
Who? Your girlfriend?

604
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,326
Don't tell me it was your mom.

605
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,163
Whatever. Let's just go.

606
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,708
We could get an urgent call at any moment,
so let's cram in every extra bite.

607
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,835
What are we having anyway?

608
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,420
Beef? Raw fish?

609
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,089
Sushi?

610
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,007
Good grief.

611
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:09,055
TRADITIONAL CHINESE CUISINE

612
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,107
Nurse Cheon, dig in.

613
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,116
Maybe I should've dressed better.
Living nearby, I just threw something on.

614
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,912
Who cares? We are here to eat.
It's good to be comfortable.

615
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,039
You say that, but… Prada!

616
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,791
You look good.

617
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,836
Isn't this a bit much, Dr. Baek?

618
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,755
This place is really expensive.

619
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,256
I'm loaded.

620
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,050
Silver spoon?

621
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,344
Or do your parents own a building?

622
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,261
Not at all.

623
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,722
I'm the rich one.

624
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,766
I lost my parents young.

625
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,436
Sorry, I didn't mean to bring it up.

626
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,688
It's fine. I don't mind talking about it.

627
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,277
Oh, of course.

628
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,695
Compassion.

629
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,408
This is not the best time to mention it,

630
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,159
but since we're on the subject,

631
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,622
my mother passed away when I was little,
so I have no memories of her.

632
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,416
My father was a street cleaner.

633
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,752
One day, during an early morning shift,

634
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,629
he got into a car accident.

635
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,798
His injuries were so severe

636
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,426
that no hospital would admit him.

637
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:29,969
In the end,

638
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,848
he died at the last hospital
he was taken to.

639
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,185
That's why I became a doctor.

640
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,278
You said to lean on a sob story.

641
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,779
But what I meant was--

642
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,865
Anyway, if you don't eat,
I'll finish it all.

643
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,283
Wait. We're on it too.

644
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,701
Dr. Yang, eat up.

645
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,743
Sure.

646
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,998
Oh, right.

647
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,250
Dr. Baek, I'm curious about something too.

648
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,627
Your arm tattoo.

649
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,962
This is just…

650
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,090
It is believed to ward off all bullets.

651
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,884
Excuse me?

652
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,052
I've run through countless battlefields,

653
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,763
and I never once got hit.

654
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,545
Syria, huh?

655
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,882
Were you off on an IMAFP mission?

656
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,634
Well, something like that.

657
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,012
Is that when you learned
to fly a helicopter?

658
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,765
Do doctors in Syria fly the helicopters--

659
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,642
Time for the major announcement.

660
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,894
Hey, Anus.

661
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,020
This is about you.

662
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,815
Now that you're part of trauma surgery,
it feels wrong to still call you "Anus."

663
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,443
I agree. It's wrong.

664
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,653
So I thought

665
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,655
I might…

666
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,452
untag you from the "Anus" label.

667
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,872
I've given it careful consideration.

668
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,000
How about "No. 1"?

669
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,878
-"No.  1"?
-Yes.

670
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,965
Like Protégé No. 1?

671
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,174
Pass me a napkin.

672
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,300
Sure.

673
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,387
No, not protégé.

674
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,347
Slave No. 1.

675
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,520
No way! Please don't.

676
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,939
I want a different…
Just call me by my name.

677
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,693
No. 1, what are you doing?
Answer the phone.

678
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,491
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

679
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,287
Yang Jae-won of trauma surgery.

680
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,790
What?

681
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,586
It's a pedestrian accident, sir.

682
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,005
Prep an OR. We'll be there in ten.

683
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,214
We'll be right there.

684
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,674
I'll come with you.

685
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,009
Nope, you're off duty.

686
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,057
He's right.

687
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,310
I'm off duty.

688
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,983
I meant to tell you this.
I'm busy, so I'll keep it short.

689
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,361
Gangster, you're seriously mistaken
about something.

690
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,406
You fight to win, okay?
To hell with protecting the team.

691
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,782
I'm going to win.

692
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,286
Finish it all and follow us.

693
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,666
What is he saying?

694
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,419
How can I eat all this?

695
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,171
Taxi!

696
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,381
-Hey, No. 1!
-Sir?

697
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,759
Let's keep it under five.

698
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,053
Hey, let me borrow that.

699
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,141
CHINESE DELIVERY

700
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,918
Dr. Baek.

701
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,003
We started CPR 34 minutes ago.

702
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:33,921
Clear!

703
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,173
Shock.

704
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,402
Stop.

705
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:58,946
Get down.

706
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,716
Call their next of kin.

707
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,093
Take him to the morgue.

708
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,768
It's not your fault, Dr. Baek.

709
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,771
His cervical vertebra is fractured.

710
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,815
And his skull is crushed.

711
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,903
Still, if I had been here…

712
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,449
It would have been the same.

713
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,162
Even you can't save every patient.

714
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,044
Fall victim incoming!

715
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,172
Make way.

716
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,365
Prep an OR. Hurry!

717
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,960
We had to keep running.

718
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,842
Even agonizing over a patient's death

719
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,886
was a luxury to us.

720
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,310
Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year.

721
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,189
It felt as though if we stopped,

722
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,485
even for a moment,
someone's heart would stop too.

723
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,533
So we

724
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,993
had to keep running.

725
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,415
New patient!

726
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,085
To keep our patients' hearts beating,

727
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,045
we must

728
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:22,714
keep running.

729
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:36,395
SURGERY IN PROGRESS
