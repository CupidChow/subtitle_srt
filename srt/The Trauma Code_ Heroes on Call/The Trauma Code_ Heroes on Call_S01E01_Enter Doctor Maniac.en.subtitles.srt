00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,689
THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

3
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,068
Now to a heartbreaking story.

4
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,571
A patient died while being transported
to the hospital yesterday,

5
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,949
following a hit-and-run incident.

6
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,159
The ambulance carrying Patient A

7
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,204
had to visit no fewer than five hospitals.

8
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,415
When Patient A reached the final hospital,

9
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,334
medics had no choice
but to announce them dead on arrival.

10
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,923
This year alone, 13 similar cases
have already occurred.

11
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,134
There are growing concerns

12
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,596
that Korea's trauma response system
may not be functioning properly.

13
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,973
A trauma center

14
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,810
is a specialized facility for treating

15
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:16,149
emergency patients with critical injuries
beyond the capabilities of a general ER.

16
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,986
In order to provide adequate personnel,
facilities, and resources,

17
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,905
the Ministry of Health and Welfare
plans to invest heavily

18
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,660
in promoting the use of trauma centers
over the next five years.

19
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,164
No more senseless deaths

20
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,916
in this country!

21
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,501
That is my promise!

22
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,337
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE
KANG MYEONG-HUI

23
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,589
That's how my inaugural speech went.

24
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,261
But just look at the state of things.

25
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,558
Who do we have here?

26
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,187
Directors of the top tertiary hospitals
in the country!

27
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,397
So why can't you do any better? Why?

28
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,693
Director Choi Jo-eun?

29
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,987
Yes, Madam Minister.

30
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:08,868
How much funding was allocated
to Hankuk Hospital's Trauma Team?

31
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,703
About that…

32
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,581
They got ten billion won!

33
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,417
Did we get good bang for our buck?

34
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,755
Nobody wants to see the Trauma Team
running smoothly more than I do.

35
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,006
But?

36
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,091
But, as you know,

37
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:28,679
there is only one person in Korea
who can be considered a trauma specialist.

38
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,680
Indeed.

39
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,100
-He collapsed from overwork.
-Yes.

40
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:36,020
Dr. Kwon has done a great job
leading the Trauma Team so far.

41
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,356
But our hands are tied.

42
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,401
Everyone saw him collapse
with their own eyes.

43
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,654
Is there a single doctor out there
who'd be willing to fill his shoes?

44
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,989
Yes.

45
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,867
Who?

46
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,956
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

47
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,419
I reached out

48
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,924
to someone incredible and asked them
to come all the way here to see us.

49
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,760
He'll be arriving soon.

50
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,433
Dr. An Jeong-won of pediatrics,
please come to OR 12.

51
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,934
I repeat…

52
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,196
Dr. Kwon Hak-su
of Hankuk National University Hospital,

53
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,450
a pioneer in trauma care,
has collapsed from overwork.

54
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:35,204
Dr. Kwon, known as the "sole champion"
of the tough field of trauma care…

55
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,165
So much for being the sole champion.

56
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,669
He has dedicated himself to advancing
emergency medicine in Korea.

57
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:46,966
His excessive workload has been attributed
to the unstable working environment…

58
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,509
Yang Jae-won of general surgery.

59
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,637
We have an unconscious trauma patient
coming in on an ambulance.

60
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,223
He has a stab wound
on his left upper abdomen.

61
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,852
Patient number 37. This way, please.

62
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,522
Patient number 37.

63
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,816
No BP reading at all?
What about the C-line?

64
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,152
I'll be there as soon as possible.

65
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,735
Dr. No Seung-hyeon of neurosurgery,
please come to the OR.

66
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,824
Once again, Dr. No Seung-hyeon
of neurosurgery, please come to the OR.

67
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,249
REGIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

68
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,380
New patient. Stab wound
to the left side of the abdomen.

69
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,006
-To the resuscitation room.
-Okay!

70
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,301
-BP is dropping! It's 60!
-Let's intubate right away!

71
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,636
-Avoid the knife.
-Okay!

72
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,929
One, two, three!

73
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,811
He is unconscious
with a dangerously low heart rate.

74
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,898
With the knife lodged in,
at least the bleeding is contained.

75
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,526
-Check his BP.
-Right.

76
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,864
Be careful. If the knife comes out,
it'll be a disaster.

77
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,033
-Yes, sir.
-Intubation complete.

78
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,286
-BP is still dropping. 50!
-What? 50?

79
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,580
Let's hurry.

80
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,582
-Prepare for a CT scan. Quick!
-Yes, sir.

81
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,001
Wait!

82
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,461
What is this?

83
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,256
It's a bruise.

84
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,551
-Stethoscope, please.
-Here.

85
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,529
Blood accumulating in the pericardium
is putting pressure on the heart.

86
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,825
Cardiac tamponade.

87
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,702
Call cardiothoracic.

88
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,289
They'll do a puncture.
Get a spinal needle and ultrasound ready.

89
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,290
Yes, Doctor.

90
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,000
Ultrasound. Quick!

91
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,553
Doctor, everyone is in surgery
for another two hours.

92
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,389
-Do they know it's a cardiac tamponade?
-Theirs is a heart rupture.

93
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,392
You're kidding me.

94
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,394
What do I do?

95
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,146
Must I do the puncture myself?

96
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,357
It could be something
other than the heart.

97
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,609
Shouldn't I get a CT scan to check first?

98
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,195
Okay, CT scan?

99
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,405
BP is getting too low! It's 40!

100
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,200
Shouldn't you do the puncture first?

101
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,117
Dr. Yang!

102
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,787
All right, I'll do it. Give it to me.

103
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,164
-Right, I'm doing this.
-Yes, sir.

104
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,165
-I got this.
-Right.

105
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,584
Okay.

106
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
Here I go.

107
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,693
Who the hell are you?

108
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,700
Xiphoid process. 45 degrees to the left.

109
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,536
You can't just…

110
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,148
What? BP is stabilizing.

111
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,405
Who are you?

112
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,326
Kid, you call yourself an ER doctor
when you can't even do a puncture right?

113
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,286
Me?

114
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,496
My specialty is the anus.

115
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,708
So why are you hanging around the ER?

116
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,627
Because I'm on call.

117
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,382
We all take turns. General surgery,
cardiothoracic surgery, then neurosurgery.

118
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,592
Ridiculous.

119
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,474
What, are you a doctor or something?

120
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:51,145
Whatever the case, I appreciate your help,
but I'd like you to leave now.

121
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,480
You're on my turf.

122
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,523
I'm not done yet.

123
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,318
Hey, I asked you who you are.

124
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,112
I'm an attending trauma surgeon here,
starting today.

125
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,739
No way.

126
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,041
Are you Dr. Kwon's replacement?

127
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,213
This isn't your turf.

128
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,131
It's mine.

129
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,014
The name's Baek Kang-hyuk.

130
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,100
Hey, Anus.

131
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,853
What's the next step?

132
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,774
My name is not Anus. It's Yang Jae-won.

133
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,484
I decide who deserves their name.

134
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,444
So, what do you do next?

135
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,987
Next?

136
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,950
We got the cardiac tamponade
under control.

137
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,327
We need to check the stab wound,
so a CT scan?

138
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,495
CT scan?

139
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:55,209
When this patient was rescued,
a broken knife blade was found nearby.

140
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,004
Hey, Anus.

141
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,173
When assessing trauma patients,

142
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:05,636
the circumstances of the accident are
as important as their current condition.

143
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,597
-Don't you know that?
-Pardon? Yes, I do know that.

144
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,060
Then did you check how the patient
was stabbed and in what environment?

145
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,895
No.

146
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,273
A gangster? And the weapon?

147
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,859
A sashimi knife.
A nasty stab to the upper abdomen.

148
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:26,657
So I made light of the stab wound
and just pulled the knife out.

149
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,658
And what happened?

150
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,202
Even with the knife gone,
the bleeding wasn't severe.

151
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,748
Yes, the broken knife could only
have caused a shallow wound to start with.

152
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,750
What does that tell us?

153
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,630
His fucked-up BP and lack of consciousness

154
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,924
were a direct result
of the cardiac tamponade.

155
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,931
What's the next step?

156
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,683
The next step?

157
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,229
-Lots of gauze.
-Here.

158
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,231
Gauze? What for?

159
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,403
The patient is still unconscious,
so there must also be an issue over here.

160
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,113
Get ready for a burst.

161
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,323
Burst?

162
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,659
What on earth…

163
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,870
Call anesthesiology and prep for surgery.

164
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,787
Yes, sir!

165
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,876
The hand of God?

166
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,046
Supposedly, he can save someone
on the brink of death

167
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,048
with the flick of a scalpel.

168
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,551
How have I never heard of such a whiz?
Did he not go to Hankuk University?

169
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,719
Is he from overseas?

170
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,387
He went to Muhan University.

171
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,139
What? Muhan?

172
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,933
Muhan University?

173
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,436
-Still, he's had his share of time abroad.
-Where?

174
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,897
International Medical Association
For Peace.

175
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,859
Is that all?
That's just a volunteer organization.

176
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,861
Countless doctors have been there.

177
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,988
They say he's the crème de la crème.

178
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,198
I think it was Syria.

179
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,409
He spent six years there
handling every trauma case under the sun.

180
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,453
So he did nothing but grunt work.

181
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,581
I still don't get
how a Muhan graduate ended up here.

182
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,126
What do you think?
It's cronyism at its finest.

183
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,463
Someone high-up just gave him the job.

184
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,673
Who could that be?

185
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,967
Who brought in that Baek Kang-hyuk guy?

186
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,093
Kang Myeong-hui.

187
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,094
Kang Myeong-hui?

188
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,637
Wait a second.

189
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,138
Kang Myeong-hui?

190
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,891
The same Kang Myeong-hui that I know?

191
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,525
Is that why the minister will show up

192
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,152
at the appointment ceremony
of just another attending?

193
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,489
Don't ask.
Kang Myeong-hui, or whatever her name is.

194
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,824
I just can't be bothered.

195
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,203
What does she expect to accomplish
with just one crony?

196
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,956
It spells disaster. It really does.

197
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:45,838
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

198
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,966
-What is it?
-Dr. Hwang Seon-u, this is the ER.

199
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,718
You're on call for the Trauma Team--

200
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,887
Just find another anesthesiologist.
Take it elsewhere.

201
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,390
The patient's condition is too critical--

202
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,183
You want me to come in right now?

203
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,727
No, sir. It's just that--

204
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,020
I'm off this afternoon.

205
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,604
What is this, hotline dating?

206
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,276
Look, you should call me first
and give me a heads-up

207
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,486
so I can prep for surgery in advance.

208
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,490
Honestly, you're a fourth-year resident,
and you haven't got a fucking clue.

209
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,453
When will you figure it out? Huh?
When is that going to happen?

210
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,872
Goddamn it, man.

211
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,707
-So full of crap.
-What?

212
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,292
What was that? Who are you?

213
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,294
I'm an attending, you asshole.

214
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,671
-An attending?
-You little…

215
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,925
Who the hell are you to demand a heads-up
for a surgery that nobody can predict?

216
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,636
What I meant was,
I was on call yesterday, too, so--

217
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,513
Cut the crap. Get over here now.

218
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,392
If you're not in the OR when I get there,
you're dead meat. Got it?

219
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,519
Answer me!

220
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,271
Yes, sir. I understand.

221
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,690
What the…

222
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,201
Dr. Baek!

223
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:01,413
There are no ORs available.
They're all booked for surgeries--

224
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,627
But there is the emergency OR.

225
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,337
Right this way.

226
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,008
TRAUMA/INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

227
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,186
The room was renovated with funding, but…

228
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,021
A quick fix just to save face.

229
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,856
Is it at least functional?

230
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,943
Well, it's never really been used.

231
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,486
Who is the head of Trauma Team?

232
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,364
There isn't one.

233
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,493
Y'all are doing just fine.

234
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,494
It's not that bad.

235
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,789
The emergency department
has been supportive.

236
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,834
This place could pass
for a damn corner store.

237
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,462
I'm here!

238
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,673
-Anesthesiology?
-Yes, sir.

239
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,551
You must be the one I talked to on the…

240
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,387
Hey, Buzz Cut.

241
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,015
Let's save the patient first.

242
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,184
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,721
Scalpel.

244
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,622
You're pretty nimble-fingered, Anus.

245
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,583
This is nothing.
By the way, I'm not Anus. I'm Yang--

246
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,500
Here it is.

247
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,090
A splenic artery branch was cut.
That explains all the blood.

248
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,095
Tie it off already.

249
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,181
Right, I'll do it right away. But…

250
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,059
where do I tie it off?

251
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,146
You can't see this?

252
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,900
Right angle.

253
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,155
I guess it's not visible
to an average person.

254
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,456
Tie it off, will you?

255
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay. Black Silk 3-0, please.

256
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,929
Wait.

257
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,643
Dr. Baek, there's more blood oozing out.

258
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,979
You little piece of shit.

259
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,147
-Did I do something wrong?
-Hey!

260
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,402
Yes?

261
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,696
-Did you use inotropics?
-Yes.

262
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,906
Well, the BP was only 60 over 40.

263
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,950
You used inotropics for that?

264
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,202
On a patient who just had a puncture?

265
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,954
Well, I just…

266
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,664
The BP was only…

267
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,750
You tried to take a shortcut,
and now you're screwed.

268
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,045
Resident, get on the phone
and call in a different anesthesiologist.

269
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,257
Sir, I think you're being unreasonable.

270
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,258
Unreason--

271
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,513
A doctor does not screw a patient over
for his own convenience.

272
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,767
You're not even a doctor,
so you shouldn't be in the OR!

273
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,026
The rest of you, stitch him up
and prepare for a thoracotomy.

274
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,069
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, Doctor.

275
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,001
-He threw out one of our own?
-He's plain crazy.

276
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,755
We are at the very top
of the surgical pecking order.

277
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,384
How dare a lowly trauma surgeon
humiliate the Anesthesia Team?

278
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,348
All right, so who's going to go?

279
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,266
That punk, obviously.

280
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,352
Ppark!

281
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,823
This is anesthesiology resident
Park Gyeong-won.

282
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,700
Ppark, it's an emergency.

283
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,369
Hurry over to the emergency OR.

284
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,914
I'm studying. Does it have to be me?

285
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,207
Hey, Ppark.

286
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,210
What are you, a fellow?
I said it's emergency surgery!

287
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,503
How dare you…

288
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,469
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

289
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,398
Hey.

290
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,524
Yes?

291
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,359
Not you, the anesthesiologist.

292
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,444
Yes?

293
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,407
Did you lower the heart rate on purpose?
I see less movement.

294
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,284
I figured it could be a rupture.

295
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:35,580
RUPTURE: TEAR OR BREAK
DUE TO EXTERNAL DAMAGE

296
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,249
What is your name?

297
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,628
Park Gyeong-won, sir.

298
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,133
It is a rupture.

299
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,928
Let's pick up the pace.

300
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,513
3-0, please.

301
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,858
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave…

302
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,694
Where on earth is he?
He's not even answering his phone.

303
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,321
The minister has arrived.

304
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,326
Hello.

305
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,996
Hello.

306
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,708
Thank you for making the time, ma'am.

307
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,543
-It's an honor.
-Not at all.

308
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,213
I have very high hopes
for Dr. Baek's performance here.

309
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,424
Actually, Dr. Baek isn't here yet.

310
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,260
Let's wait a while, then.

311
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,970
-May I…
-This way, please.

312
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,930
Hello. Do take a seat.

313
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,901
CURRENT TIME - DURATION OF SURGERY

314
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,246
What time is it?

315
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,417
What's taking him so long?
The man is anything but punctual.

316
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,673
Okay, cut.

317
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,469
Let's close the chest now.

318
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,356
Done.

319
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,115
One hour, 42 minutes.

320
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,458
I can't believe he finished it so fast.

321
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,627
Oh my!

322
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,670
Fast, my ass.

323
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,465
It shouldn't take more than 90 minutes.
We went ten minutes over.

324
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,634
Thanks to someone's pathetic assistance.

325
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,719
It wasn't pathetic.

326
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,847
You made me late
for my appointment ceremony.

327
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,474
Has it started?

328
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,392
What?

329
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,604
Since I'm late anyway, I may as well
see the patient wake up.

330
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,689
You're not going?

331
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,525
But it's your appointment ceremony.

332
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,318
I need to see the patient wake up.

333
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,196
Please, Dr. Baek. You should hurry.

334
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,288
He's an odd one.

335
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,374
-Let's wait a little longer.
-Yes, ma'am.

336
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,921
I see why Kang handpicked Baek Kang-hyuk.

337
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,382
To brace for the parliamentary audit.

338
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,843
And the director okayed it

339
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,597
so he could bring in
some worthless Muhan graduate

340
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,891
and make the Trauma Team remain
nothing more than a hollow shell.

341
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,853
What I can't figure out, though,

342
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,483
is why he came to this hospital
knowing full well he'd be an outcast.

343
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,620
What time is it?

344
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,538
-We're all busy here.
-There he is.

345
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,457
He's finally here.

346
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,501
-What a brat!
-So inconsiderate.

347
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,337
-He's an hour late!
-We're all busy.

348
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,464
-Dr. Baek, you're late.
-Yes, I'm late.

349
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,342
It would be best to start with an apology.

350
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,053
Wait! You should greet the minister first.

351
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,095
It's all right.

352
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,139
She says it's all right.

353
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,562
Hello, all. I am Baek Kang-hyuk,
the new attending trauma surgeon.

354
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,901
The director would like me
to start by apologizing.

355
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,903
But I refuse to do that.

356
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,034
I think I should be getting
an apology instead.

357
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:54,214
They offered me the attending position
and agreed to reorganize the Trauma Team.

358
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,298
But it turns out

359
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,177
that they were kind of just
looking for a figurehead.

360
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,140
In any case,
I'll tell you why I came to this place.

361
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,519
My goal is to take the Trauma Team…

362
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,441
and shut it down for good.

363
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,450
Dr. Baek, what's wrong with you?

364
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,743
Let's have a quick chat.

365
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,036
-Let me talk--
-Excuse me!

366
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,663
Yes?

367
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,420
Was it Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk?

368
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,671
Yes.

369
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,133
It's unbefitting of a trauma surgeon
to say things like that.

370
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,592
On your first day, no less.

371
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,304
"Despite the tough reality,
I will do my best."

372
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,098
Wouldn't that be more appropriate?

373
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:52,021
I'm Han Yu-rim, Head of General Surgery
and an attending colorectal surgeon.

374
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,940
Right, Dr. Han Yu-rine.

375
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,861
No, not "Yu-rine." Han Yu-rim.
My name is Han Yu-rim.

376
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,362
Right. Thank you.

377
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:04,284
I actually tested the waters
of this tertiary hospital earlier.

378
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,120
It's almost laughable.

379
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,624
I've been told that you've never had
a dedicated trauma department.

380
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,128
Other departments just take turns
being on call at the Trauma Team,

381
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,881
as if passing around a ticking time bomb.

382
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,842
-Please choose your words--
-Do you know who I found?

383
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,721
An on-call colorectal surgeon
dealing with a trauma patient by himself.

384
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,431
What did you say?

385
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,852
I've never seen
such sincere, earnest efforts

386
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,147
to kill a person in my life.

387
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,317
I can't put up with this any longer.

388
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,695
The system is messed up.

389
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,034
No wonder the on-call doctor
messed up so badly like a quack.

390
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,535
How insulting. I've had enough.

391
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,912
Dr. Baek!

392
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:49,996
Watch your mouth!

393
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,457
-That's too harsh!
-How dare you call one of us a quack?

394
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,167
Who do you think you are?

395
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,130
I couldn't just sit around
and watch the quack kill a man.

396
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,925
So I performed a quick surgery.
That's what held me up.

397
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,386
That's why I won't apologize.

398
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,638
And that's why

399
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm going to shut it down.

400
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,391
What do you mean?

401
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,312
Are we a joke to you?
Do you think this hospital is a joke?

402
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,273
Please don't get the wrong idea.

403
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,026
Dr. Baek!

404
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:24,948
I'll get rid of that useless Trauma Team,
take it up a notch,

405
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:29,160
and then reopen it as the Trauma Center.

406
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,958
Center?

407
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,294
-What utter nonsense!
-You're out of control.

408
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,217
Ma'am, you got my back, right?

409
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,261
Sure. I'll be watching you.

410
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,974
I'll help you get the most
out of that ten billion won.

411
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,898
I will show you all
that I'm the real deal.

412
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,109
That's all I have to say.

413
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,944
Over and out.

414
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,488
-Who do you think you are?
-Dr. Baek.

415
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,282
-Hey, get back here!
-Dr. Baek!

416
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,241
Hey!

417
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,951
You owe us an apology!

418
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,620
What's all this about? Wait, Dr. Baek.

419
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,538
Dr. Baek!

420
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,833
You don't even deserve to be here!

421
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,919
If I may add to that sentiment.

422
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,841
Dr. Baek may be blunt with his words,

423
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,510
but I don't think he's incorrect.

424
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,721
I personally vouch for his skills.

425
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,557
Give him a chance, for my sake.

426
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,683
Thank you.

427
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,436
Madam Minister?

428
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,315
Applause.

429
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,907
What? A pet name?

430
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,867
What is he talking about?

431
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,077
Let's just go.

432
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,621
Come on.

433
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,081
Dr. Baek called you "Anus" earlier.

434
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,876
That's not a pet name.
He was making fun of me.

435
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,797
Still, I think he took a liking to you,
teaching you like you're his student.

436
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,967
His student? Hey, don't scare me.

437
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,345
I'd never forfeit
the glory of colorectal surgery

438
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,473
to opt for trauma surgery,
a specialty with no future.

439
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:18,311
Take this hospital, for example.
The Trauma Team exists in name only.

440
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,228
Right.

441
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,608
Dr. Kwon struggled all alone.
I could never do that. I won't.

442
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,569
"Colorectal" may not sound pretty,
but the outlook is strong.

443
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,988
Emergencies are rare.
It's ideal for a clinic.

444
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,366
-The pay isn't bad either.
-You're right.

445
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,535
You're cut out for colorectal.

446
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,912
That nickname is perfect.

447
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,747
Thanks for the coffee.

448
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,548
He's right, so why am I ticked off?

449
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,181
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

450
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,017
Yang Jae-won of general surgery.

451
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,358
Where is it?

452
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,621
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY
ATTENDING TRAUMA SURGEON BAEK KANG-HYUK

453
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,581
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

454
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,132
Where did he go?

455
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,807
Yes?

456
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,102
I'm here to see a patient.

457
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,937
And you are?

458
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,523
Baek Kang-hyuk, attending trauma surgeon.

459
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,567
There's no doctor here by that name.

460
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,029
Don't go around pretending to be a doctor.

461
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,739
Hey, listen.

462
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,742
I really am a doctor here.

463
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,745
I did a thoracotomy in there
this morning, for God's sake.

464
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,538
There's no need to be rude.

465
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,249
I'm here to see a patient,
but you won't let me!

466
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,960
And keep your voice down.
There are patients in here.

467
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,254
-Patients…
-What is the name of your patient?

468
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,256
I didn't get a look at his name.

469
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,386
I know the doctor
who brought the patient in.

470
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,346
His name is…

471
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,182
He's called…

472
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,017
Anus?

473
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,814
What's wrong with this asshole?

474
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,357
Hey, come on!

475
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,193
Hey!

476
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,945
Damn, what a cheeky brat.

477
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,406
Hey, Anus!

478
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,910
Perfect timing.

479
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,954
Baek…

480
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,956
So I'm "Baek" to you now?

481
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,874
No!

482
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,460
Dr. Baek, I've been looking for you.

483
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,087
Me?

484
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,505
Why?

485
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,381
Bukhansan.

486
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,303
A hiker fell off the Bukhansan trail.

487
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,555
The patient needs urgent care.

488
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,557
But

489
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,353
their injuries are so severe,
they might not make it here.

490
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,148
-Is the helicopter on its way?
-Well…

491
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,777
The National Rescue Unit
says they're on their way.

492
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,946
Tell them to stop by here first.

493
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,615
We'll go treat the patient at the scene.

494
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,616
Okay.

495
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,286
"We"?

496
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,538
Is there a problem?

497
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,289
What do you mean "we"?

498
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,126
Me and you.

499
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,461
For now…

500
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,009
Call me when the helicopter is here, okay?
I'll be checking on my patient.

501
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,719
Don't forget the trauma kit!

502
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,596
Wait a second! I…

503
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,730
You're going in a helicopter?

504
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,775
With me?

505
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,282
The emergency ICU.

506
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,620
"Internal medicine"?

507
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,041
So the emergency ICU
is a stopgap for the main ICU.

508
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,762
Who are you? How did you get in here?

509
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,600
Your voice rings a bell.

510
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,645
-That hardhead from earlier?
-What are you on about?

511
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,231
Cut the crap and leave.
This place is for medics only.

512
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,066
Look, I'm one of them.

513
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,735
Whatever.

514
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,071
-Give me your name.
-What will you do with it?

515
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,783
"Cheon Jang-mi."

516
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,493
Happy now?

517
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,370
-Now get out.
-Ouch!

518
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,665
Get out.

519
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,626
-Not that way. This way.
-Wait.

520
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,169
Listen, I'm…

521
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,545
Just give me a moment!

522
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,925
A tattoo?

523
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,428
He has one too?

524
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,226
I'm telling you,
he's the one I took care of!

525
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,645
"Took care of"?

526
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,821
MEDICAL OXYGEN

527
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,423
No!

528
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,264
No way.

529
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,392
Let go of me!

530
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,643
Why are you so strong?

531
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,895
-So strong!
-Let me go, man!

532
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,189
Hey! Damn it, woman!

533
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,691
Oh my!

534
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,401
Stay still for a second.

535
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,028
Stop moving!

536
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,280
-I saw nothing!
-Doctor, call the police!

537
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,448
Hey!

538
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,992
-No! It's not what it looks like.
-Call the police!

539
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,744
-Call the cops!
-The cops?

540
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,912
-This darn woman!
-Please calm down!

541
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,749
Don't come any closer!

542
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,626
Doctor, this guy's a gangster!

543
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,302
No, he's not.

544
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,846
He's an attending.

545
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,976
He is our new attending.

546
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,686
He is Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.

547
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,649
Oh my.

548
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,403
-Apologies, Doctor.
-Gangster?

549
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,449
You're more like a gangster than I am.

550
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,701
But you said
you "took care of" the patient…

551
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,248
I'm sorry.

552
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,668
Right. Nurse Cheon Jang-mi.

553
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,840
From now on,

554
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,843
you're Gangster.

555
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,428
Gangster.

556
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,346
Sorry?

557
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,317
I thought death was my only way
out of the gang.

558
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,570
Thank you, Doctor.

559
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,282
You even saved someone like me.

560
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,581
Who you are and what you do
are not important.

561
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,836
I just did what I had to do as a doctor.

562
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,549
To be honest,

563
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,177
the most important thing
is that you met me.

564
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,431
Others couldn't have done it.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

565
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,644
Had you met a quack,

566
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,147
you'd be on your way to meet your maker.

567
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,982
I heard it's really hot down there.

568
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,069
And this doctor

569
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,073
played a vital role in saving you.

570
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,496
The stitches on your stomach that he did
will hardly be noticeable.

571
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,206
He has the hand of God, you see.

572
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,709
Me?

573
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,627
Thank you so much.

574
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,255
AN JUNG-HEON

575
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,424
Yang Jae-won of general surgery.

576
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,426
Now? Okay, understood.

577
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,386
The helicopter is here.

578
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,763
Take care, then.

579
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,392
Nurse Cheon.

580
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,685
Hey, Gangster.

581
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,770
Check his vitals every 30 minutes.

582
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,105
Yes, sir.

583
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,565
-Run, Anus!
-Yes, sir!

584
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:27,943
"Anus"?

585
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,781
You're a gangster?

586
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,287
It's just a nickname.

587
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,047
Wait, Dr. Baek!

588
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,384
-What?
-Wrong way! The heliport is that way!

589
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,719
It's not on the roof?

590
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,970
No, it's over that way.

591
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,805
Damn, why didn't you say so?

592
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,055
This is the heliport?

593
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,432
That's right. Dr. Baek, have a safe trip.

594
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,561
-Wear it on your front!
-Pardon?

595
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,230
-It could get caught in the blades.
-On my front?

596
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,816
-We need to get on now.
-No, I really can't!

597
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,235
I mean it!

598
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,450
Let's go!

599
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,662
Help! This is really happening!

600
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,122
Save me!

601
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,708
NATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY
119 RESCUE UNIT

602
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,002
Help me!

603
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,697
The official document
was issued a year ago.

604
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,825
But this is my first ride
alongside doctors.

605
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,703
This will be as frequent as coffee breaks
from now on.

606
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,746
Your name is?

607
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,582
An Jung-heon, a team leader
in the National Rescue Unit.

608
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,959
Are you familiar with helicopters?

609
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,628
You're not nervous at all.

610
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,838
This is pretty standard.

611
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,134
That would be the standard reaction.

612
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,974
Anus, will you be able
to save patients like that?

613
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,976
I have a fear of heights.

614
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,897
You have such a long way to go.

615
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:22,326
Visibility is dire in this weather.
There are gusty winds too.

616
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,953
Captain, I don't think
we can get any closer.

617
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,211
How are things on the ground?

618
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,880
The patient's condition is critical.

619
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,008
He is unconscious with a very weak pulse.

620
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,638
We suspect an impact on his right chest
from the fall, with possible rib damage.

621
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,849
-How much time do we have?
-He needs to be treated immediately.

622
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,143
You're bringing doctors, right?

623
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,230
He won't withstand transport
in his current state.

624
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,775
We'll lose the patient
if he's not treated right away!

625
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,945
You should hurry, Captain.

626
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,658
It's too risky.
The gusts are making it impossible.

627
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,784
What?

628
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,912
Our own lives are in danger.
We must turn back.

629
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,919
I guess we have no choice, then.

630
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,547
Hold on tight.

631
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,923
Dr. Baek?

632
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,593
Goodness!

633
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,637
No can do?

634
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,763
What are you doing?

635
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,181
Sit back down quickly!

636
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,516
It looks hopeful to me.

637
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,934
Do something, Mr. An!

638
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,859
Can't we just carry him down?

639
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,569
You know that's impossible.

640
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,548
Captain?

641
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,675
Let's trade places.

642
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,385
Right.

643
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,521
We're here. Grab the kit and get ready!

644
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,314
We're here?

645
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,244
Shut the door! Shut it now!

646
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,121
No, I can't!

647
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,461
Hurry up!

648
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,339
No, I really can't.
I'm already in the helicopter.

649
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,925
I really can't do it. No way!

650
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,761
Anus, what if your family were down there?

651
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,486
No!

652
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,991
Dr. Baek, you're not jumping, are you?

653
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:49,908
See you later.

654
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,243
Save me!

655
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,120
-Help!
-Dr. Baek!

656
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:54,504
