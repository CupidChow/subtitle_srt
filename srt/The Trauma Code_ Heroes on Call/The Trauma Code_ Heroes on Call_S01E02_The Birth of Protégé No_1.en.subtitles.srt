THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

3
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,950
No, I really can't! I mean it!

4
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,911
I really can't do this!

5
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,212
What are you doing?

6
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,051
Dr. Baek, you're not jumping, are you?

7
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,512
-See you later.
-Save me!

8
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,806
-Help!
-Dr. Baek!

9
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,981
Are you sure he's a doctor?

10
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,608
Why is no one stopping him?

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,752
There's a gap!

12
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,713
Dr. Baek, you'll die! Please don't!

13
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,226
Take me with you.

14
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,196
This is frustrating!

15
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,407
I'm scared.

16
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,533
I'm terrified!

17
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,912
Take me with you! Please!

18
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,249
Who are you?

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,210
He's a doctor. Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.

20
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,587
-Stethoscope!
-Yes, sir!

21
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,422
-Quick!
-Here.

22
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,688
No breath sounds
in the upper lobe of the right lung.

23
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,772
What does that mean?

24
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,902
It's a pneumothorax!

25
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,070
There are no breath sounds at all!

26
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,784
-It's a tension pneumothorax!
-Then what's next?

27
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,911
A puncture!

28
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,954
The air in the lung must come out.

29
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,122
Hold tight!

30
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,946
Dr. Baek!

31
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,864
He's still unconscious!

32
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,033
If the air in the lung was the cause--

33
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,077
He should have started coughing by now.

34
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,753
His pupils are not responding, Dr. Baek.

35
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,172
He has a brain hemorrhage. Papilledema!

36
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,340
Sorry?

37
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,384
We must relieve the intracranial pressure!

38
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,347
That calls for a decompression.
But we can't do that here!

39
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,308
-What is the patient's condition?
-Let's hurry and get him in the air.

40
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,769
The chopper can't stay forever!

41
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,021
Let's secure the patient.

42
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,777
Raising the hoist.

43
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,000
Get ready.

44
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,335
I'm opening his skull in the helicopter.

45
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,461
Pardon?

46
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,587
His skull!

47
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,214
Right. What?

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,757
We're gonna take his lid off!

49
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,342
Okay?

50
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,595
What?

51
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,356
Get a grip.

52
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,233
Don't let the height get to you.

53
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,901
Think only of the patient.

54
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,112
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,196
Get started.

56
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,698
Shave it real close.

57
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,825
Just a moment, Dr. Baek.

58
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,826
Are you serious?

59
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,661
We're 15 minutes from the hospital.

60
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,873
Once we land,
15 minutes before surgery can start.

61
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,458
Unless we open his skull now,

62
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,460
this helicopter will become a hearse.

63
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,131
Let's steady his breathing first.
We'll go with incision, not intubation.

64
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,573
Mr. An, get the Ambu bag, please.

65
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,742
Okay, I've got it.

66
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,711
He's practically glowing.

67
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,548
You wanted a close shave.

68
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,008
That was a compliment.

69
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,427
It's time.

70
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,970
Disinfect and pull the scalp.

71
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,888
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,432
But Dr. Baek,

73
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,976
can you really do this?

74
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,686
A decompression in a helicopter?

75
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,148
I've done it in worse conditions.

76
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,068
Where?

77
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,947
Afghanistan.

78
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,738
We've managed to pull off anesthesia
and fasciotomy, but how do we make a hole?

79
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,033
-What? You didn't bring a hand drill?
-Pardon?

80
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,035
A hand…

81
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,330
I doubt you'll find one in a trauma kit.

82
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,671
What's that for?

83
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,423
-Pour it on.
-Sorry?

84
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,467
-Sir?
-Pour the disinfectant.

85
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,635
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,721
What…

87
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,599
What are you thinking?

88
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,184
Stop babbling and hold tight.

89
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,643
The hole must be precise.

90
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,899
Stop, Dr. Baek! This can't be right.

91
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,569
There must be some other way.

92
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,279
All right, here goes.

93
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,165
Tea just tastes better in this teacup.

94
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,800
What on earth?

95
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,136
Earthquake!

96
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,096
It's an earthquake!

97
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,478
Wow, he actually airlifted a patient.

98
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,897
I've never seen anything like this.

99
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,024
I've seen it around ten times.

100
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,526
This is my fifth year here.

101
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,611
Ten times?

102
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,571
Yes, when Dr. Kwon was here.

103
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,990
We lost three patients during landing.

104
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,408
Really? How come?

105
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,162
This isn't a real heliport after all.

106
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,582
Each second counts for trauma patients,
but the landing drags on.

107
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,708
It drives us insane.

108
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,134
We're good. You can disembark now.

109
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,102
One, two, three.

110
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,021
-Let's go straight to the OR.
-Okay.

111
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,274
-Mr. An, please check the patient in.
-Okay.

112
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,275
-Anus!
-Yes, sir!

113
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,151
Press the gauze tight. Never let go!

114
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,444
Okay, I won't let go.

115
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,696
Let's go!

116
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,613
One, two!

117
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,045
Let's go.

118
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,675
Dr. Baek. I can't get hold
of the anesthesiologist.

119
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,593
What?

120
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,970
-What's going on?
-He's still not answering?

121
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,347
I know his morning shift isn't up yet.

122
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,142
That asshole must be
out of his freaking mind.

123
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,480
NURSE KIM SEONG-YUN
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

124
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,149
Ten minutes.

125
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,818
Ten more minutes.
Hold out for just ten minutes.

126
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,153
Okay, ten minutes.

127
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,447
I'll clock out on the dot.

128
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,909
-Okay, just ten more minutes.
-So he wants to get off at 12.

129
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,580
What would be the best possible way
to kill this jerk?

130
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,209
Killing him can wait.
Anesthesia comes first.

131
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,544
I'll look for him.

132
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,047
Forget it.
I don't need that piece of trash.

133
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,340
Call someone else.

134
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,217
No one is available right now
except Dr. Hwang Seon-u.

135
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,221
How about the one we had
for the thoracotomy this morning?

136
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,557
Park… Gyeong-won?

137
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,184
No, he's out of the question.

138
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,769
-How come?
-He's a fourth-year.

139
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,813
Whatever. Just call him.

140
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,981
Oh, really now?

141
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:53,235
Fourth-years preparing for their exams
are exempt from shifts or duties.

142
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,404
It's a big ask to bring him in.

143
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,115
Can we afford to be polite right now?

144
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,576
All that grace and class
won't save a single patient.

145
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,371
Call him right away. Should I do it?

146
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,797
NURSE CHEON JANG-MI

147
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,133
Resident Park Gyeong-won
of anesthesiology.

148
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,344
This is Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk
from trauma surgery.

149
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,137
I need you to come down right now.

150
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,056
What is this about?

151
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,224
Emergency surgery.

152
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,769
Hello?

153
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,563
I can't hear anything. Hello?

154
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,317
I can't hear anything.

155
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,820
Are you insane?

156
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,159
Hello, this is Nurse Cheon Jang-mi
from trauma surgery.

157
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,788
We can't get ahold of Dr. Hwang Seon-u.

158
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,665
What about the other doctors on call?

159
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,127
The office tells us to wait
for another hour or so.

160
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,963
But the patient is
in a really critical condition.

161
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,011
All right, then.

162
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,096
Thank you.

163
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,143
THE ROLE OF AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST
IN TRAUMA SURGERY

164
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,811
Dr. Baek, the patient's BP!

165
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,898
Push two amps of dexamethasone.
Go all in with mannitol.

166
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,650
-Yes, sir.
-Get me a C-line.

167
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,568
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,698
I'll get the ultrasound ready.

169
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,957
I can't get a pulse.

170
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,296
Are you going in? I'll get the ultrasound.

171
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,839
He will die waiting.

172
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,592
We have no BP reading.
You might hit his artery. Let me.

173
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,509
Hey, Anus.

174
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
Watch closely.

175
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,151
Okay, the blood color confirms
I've hit the mark.

176
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,489
When treating major trauma patients,

177
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,367
you must consider their actual condition
more than textbook knowledge.

178
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,122
Otherwise, you could end up losing a life
that might have been saved.

179
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,041
Like you almost did.

180
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,844
For anesthetics,
remifentanil and ketamine will do.

181
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,890
The surgery will relieve
the intracranial pressure. As for the BP,

182
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,643
use inotropics if it gets too low.

183
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,394
And the heart

184
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,146
will be okay.

185
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,859
No.

186
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,611
It's not okay.

187
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
My heart is pounding.

188
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,176
What magic will he perform this time?

189
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,436
Let's get started.

190
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,354
Yes, Doctor.

191
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,818
What a nutcase!

192
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,113
Calling a helicopter on his first day?

193
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,991
Doc!

194
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,077
Doc, did you see the helicopter?
That Baek Kang-hyuk dude…

195
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,204
What's with all the fuss?

196
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,956
I heard it too.

197
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,627
He transported the patient himself
by helicopter, along with Yang Jae-won.

198
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,589
That nutcase must be trying
to bring this place down and--

199
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,466
What? With Yang Jae-won?

200
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,511
He is on call for the Trauma Team today.

201
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,889
Apparently they're in surgery together
right now.

202
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,349
Yang Jae-won got in a helicopter?

203
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,476
With Baek Kang-hyuk?

204
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,645
And surgery even?

205
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,565
I have a bad feeling about this.

206
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,527
Baek Kang-hyuk can't possibly have
his eye on my protégé, can he?

207
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,696
-Hold on.
-No, there's no way.

208
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,699
He wouldn't dare steal
from the chief of general surgery.

209
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,118
-The director wants me.
-It's a possibility.

210
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,704
Yang Jae-won is indeed impressive.

211
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:20,920
Thank you.

212
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,965
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
SCHOLARSHIP PRESENTATION CEREMONY

213
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,926
ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE SCHOLARSHIP

214
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,845
Scholarships every semester
at Hankuk National University.

215
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,555
The undisputed valedictorian!

216
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,642
No way I'm losing him!

217
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,101
I already called dibs!

218
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,521
Doc?

219
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,778
What do you mean by that?

220
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,072
Who did what now?

221
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,158
The person who introduced Dr. Baek
to Minister Kang

222
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,535
was Director Oh of Chilseong Hospital.

223
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,208
I got blindsided with my eyes wide open.

224
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,710
At any rate, I'm worried.

225
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,005
They say Dr. Baek has exceptional skills.

226
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,257
I hear he saves patients
on the brink of death.

227
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,259
He'll be pouring money into treatment!

228
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,764
The more patients he saves,
the more money we'll bleed!

229
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,684
That must be the whole point
of Oh's dirty trick!

230
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,480
I did get the minister's recommendation.

231
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,608
Plus, I had no good reason to reject him.

232
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,860
So I thought I should meet him.

233
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,614
My plan was to hammer down his salary
and then scrap the whole thing.

234
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,168
He's handsome.

235
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,385
Mr. Baek Kang-hyuk?

236
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,302
Yes.

237
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,389
I will accept the attending position.

238
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,183
Just like that?

239
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,768
In a heartbeat?

240
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,813
I've always had my heart set
on your hospital.

241
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,315
Even so,

242
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,859
let me go through the terms--

243
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,110
What terms? Salary?

244
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,779
Man, who cares about the pittance?

245
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,783
These shoes, this suit, this watch…

246
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,287
I can get these things with my own money.

247
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,457
For me, the white coat
is not about making a living.

248
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,167
It's a sense of duty.

249
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,004
Aren't you a nice guy, rich and all?

250
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,006
With a sense of duty on top.

251
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,468
But you're a rude brat.

252
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,429
Just what you'd expect
from a Muhan graduate.

253
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,598
Typical behavior of a lower-tier graduate.

254
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,392
They never keep their heads down.
It gets on my nerves.

255
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,147
Director.

256
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,275
When the next assessment comes around,

257
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,652
you could just let him go.

258
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,031
What are you saying?

259
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,367
Forget it. I'm sorry.

260
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,787
The next assessment is too far off.

261
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,874
We should get rid of him
as soon as possible.

262
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,885
UNKNOWN MALE
INTRACRANIAL DECOMPRESSION

263
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,969
Scalpel.

264
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,652
This is insane.

265
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
He doesn't hesitate at all.

266
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,911
Army.

267
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,541
Hand drill.

268
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,173
Wow, look.

269
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,551
Look at him with the drill.

270
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,430
EVD.

271
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,278
Seriously, is he for real?

272
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,874
That's the head done.

273
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,959
The lungs are next.

274
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,673
UNKNOWN MALE
INTRACRANIAL DECOMPRESSION

275
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,843
PARTIAL LUNG RESECTION

276
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,614
First, cut the artery
in the right lower lobe.

277
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,657
This reduces blood loss.

278
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:08,498
Next, cut the bronchus to prevent air
from leaking into the damaged region.

279
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,756
Finish up with the vein.

280
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,262
This allows the right lower lobe
to come off with ease.

281
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,687
The cause of pain is then removed.

282
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,399
All done.

283
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,194
-Send this to the specimen lab.
-Yes, sir.

284
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,862
-Anus.
-Yes?

285
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,113
Let's close the chest.

286
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,699
Just two hours in,

287
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,119
he finished an intracranial decompression
and a partial lung resection.

288
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,037
Hey!

289
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,668
Sending out the specimen.

290
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,685
-Are you smitten?
-Sorry?

291
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,145
You seem completely taken
with my surgical skills.

292
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,984
Not even. I just thought…

293
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,612
you're not half bad.

294
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,115
What would you know?

295
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,537
What are you doing next year?
No one studies colorectal for two years.

296
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,916
Aren't you being too dismissive?
What's wrong with colorectal anyway?

297
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,502
You're the one with a dismissive attitude.

298
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,131
Muddling through in a cushy department,
hoping things will somehow work out.

299
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,716
Isn't that your little plot?

300
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,592
No, it's not.

301
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,636
Right?

302
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,641
Let me introduce you to a good specialty.
There happens to be an opening too.

303
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,060
A fellow trauma surgeon.

304
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,104
Trauma surgery?

305
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,774
What's with the reaction?

306
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,447
-I'm not saying no, but--
-It's settled, then.

307
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,118
It's just so sudden, that's all.
Please don't get me wrong.

308
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,289
Why can't you do it?

309
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,459
Give me a logical, well-structured answer.

310
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,501
Well, I…

311
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,129
I don't exactly have a reason not to,

312
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,506
but it's a major life decision, so--

313
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
Give me a proper answer in three seconds,
or I'll take it as a yes.

314
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,932
My advisor expects me to become
a second-year colorectal fellow next year.

315
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,143
-I couldn't possibly--
-What a load of bullshit.

316
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,145
It's your life. You call the shots.

317
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,230
That's…

318
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,901
Do you think your advisor
will look out for you?

319
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,528
Or help you become an attending?

320
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,240
Why are you so loyal
to that advisor of yours?

321
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,035
Am I asking for too much?

322
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,371
Did I ask you to set up
a blind date for me? No.

323
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,581
Join me and I will teach you.

324
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,333
My pass!

325
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,793
Here it is, Dr. Baek.

326
00:22:59,002 --> 00:22:59,878
Sure.

327
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,214
For you, it's a guaranteed win.

328
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,550
Of all the potential mentors out there,
I am the best.

329
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,430
That might be the case…

330
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,434
Absolutely not! My advisor--

331
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,103
Enough of that damn advisor.

332
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,774
So, your advisor has the final say, huh?

333
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,072
Where are you going?

334
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,246
Who did this?

335
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,916
Who put all this in front of my office?

336
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,503
Who left Baek Kang-hyuk's stuff here?

337
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,130
Man, honestly!

338
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,299
It's his first day,
and I already can't stand him.

339
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,843
I can't believe this!

340
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,345
I'm the head of general surgery after all.

341
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,556
He hasn't even visited me
from right next door.

342
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,515
You mean me?

343
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,644
What are you doing?

344
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,774
I'm paying you a visit
from right next door.

345
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,070
Well, even so,

346
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,072
you just let yourself in?

347
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,408
It's an urgent matter. Please take a seat.

348
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,451
But this is my room.

349
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,869
Don't tell me what to--

350
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,328
Do you prefer to stand?

351
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,538
Well, do as you wish.

352
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,957
Whatever.

353
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,417
Unbelievable.

354
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,839
All right, what's so urgent?

355
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:31,553
I believe there is a fellow on your team
by the name of Yang Jae-won.

356
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,388
Yes, there is.

357
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,349
He's my favorite student,
a true protégé of mine.

358
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,020
I thought I'd try my hand at teaching him.

359
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,026
Do they not teach manners
at Muhan University?

360
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,652
Look, Dr. Baek.

361
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,113
He is my fellow. Mine!

362
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,950
Come on. Don't be so petty about this.

363
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,327
The way I see it,

364
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,246
it's his call at the end of the day.

365
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,667
Wait.

366
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,923
Are you saying he would ditch me
and choose trauma surgery?

367
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,925
We have a long history,

368
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,385
and plenty more to come.

369
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,013
Don't tell me you're worried

370
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,934
that he'll end up
ditching and humiliating you?

371
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,061
Not at all.

372
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:21,978
In that case,

373
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,398
let's leave the choice up to him.

374
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,400
Deal?

375
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,486
Deal.

376
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,991
Let's meet at four o'clock
and talk this over, the three of us.

377
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,454
I feel cheated somehow.

378
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,958
Take the offer.

379
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,126
Don't take the offer.

380
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,127
Take it.

381
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,255
Don't take it.

382
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,673
Take it.

383
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,258
Don't take it.

384
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,262
It's a sign from above. I'm folding.

385
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
Hey there!

386
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,848
Our very own Dr. Yang Jae-dong.

387
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,642
What are you doing here?

388
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,813
Our dear Dr. Yang Jae-dong,
coveted by the trauma surgery department.

389
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,817
That being said,

390
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,151
something seems off.

391
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,780
Why is your face telling me
that you're considering the offer?

392
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,157
Listen.

393
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,536
Just yesterday,
I would've turned down such an offer.

394
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,205
-Yeah?
-But…

395
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,584
Hey, I keep having strange thoughts.

396
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:30,130
I wonder if I would become like Dr. Baek
if I went into trauma surgery.

397
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,758
No way! Not in a million years!

398
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,676
Why not?

399
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,678
You rode on a helicopter today.

400
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,887
Not only that,

401
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,639
you rappelled from it.

402
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,892
Can you really keep doing that?

403
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,695
Man, that's impossible.

404
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,447
Jae-won.

405
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,867
Do you have a sense of duty or something?

406
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,535
-A sense of duty?
-Yeah.

407
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,162
Next question.

408
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,539
Are you a maniac?

409
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,750
No, I'm as ordinary as they come.

410
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,792
Exactly.

411
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:13,340
Only maniacs with a sense of duty
make it in trauma surgery.

412
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,799
Case in point,

413
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,718
Dr. Baek.

414
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,682
See you later.

415
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,563
Maniacs with a sense of duty…

416
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,652
Oh my goodness, you're right.

417
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,779
You have a way with words.

418
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,906
-Thanks. Bye now.
-Hey.

419
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,554
Dr. Baek, thank you for the offer,
but I'm committed to colorectal surgery.

420
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,931
Look at this kid.

421
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,975
Four o'clock. My office.

422
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,065
Hey, Gangster.

423
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,277
-Good to see you, boss.
-What?

424
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,865
Since you call me "Gangster,"
I should treat you like a boss.

425
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,536
You wore your white coat today.
Now you look like a real doctor.

426
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,496
Stuff it.

427
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,457
Just tell me how to win someone over.

428
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,084
Win someone over?

429
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,629
I saw how you won
that anesthesiologist over earlier.

430
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,508
That's not what happened.
I simply asked for a favor.

431
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,051
Potato, potahto.

432
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,970
Give me some tips already.

433
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,471
Why should I?

434
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,890
Yang Jae-won.

435
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,685
How would you like to work with him?

436
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,521
Who?

437
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,815
You heard me.

438
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,275
Dr. Yang Jae-won?

439
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,363
Actually, all the nurses in our team
have a soft spot for him.

440
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,074
I'm sure they do.
He is such a soft-hearted pushover.

441
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,034
Here's the problem.

442
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,997
He said no. He's playing hard to get.

443
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,082
What a shame.

444
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,042
Hey, Gangster.

445
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,378
You've lasted here for five years.

446
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,131
I bet you wouldn't want to see
the Trauma Team disappear.

447
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,176
We're in the same boat.

448
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,471
Wouldn't it be nice
to have one more person on board?

449
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,598
-Yes?
-One more person.

450
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,477
Could we have a minute?

451
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,855
No.

452
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,649
You still don't get it.

453
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,609
Like I said,

454
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,737
Dr. Yang is a compassionate soul.

455
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,906
Try a more humane approach.

456
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,785
That's not easy. Inhumanity is my forte.

457
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,788
Compassion…

458
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,955
Give me an example.

459
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,666
Why did you want to become a doctor?

460
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,585
Me? Because of my father.

461
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,423
That's perfect!

462
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,468
Sit down with him
and have a good chat about it.

463
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,514
You want me to sell a sob story.

464
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,808
I wouldn't put it that way.

465
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,310
I'm saying you should have
a conversation with him.

466
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,772
All personal relationships
begin with a conversation, don't they?

467
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,071
You have no time to waste!

468
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,782
It seems like Dr. Han is already on it!

469
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,575
What?

470
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,119
I called Dr. Yang earlier
about an ICU patient,

471
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,955
and he was rushing off to see Dr. Han.

472
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,997
What?

473
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,041
Damn it.

474
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,966
This teacup.

475
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,135
It's a Goryeo celadon.

476
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,766
Maybe it's because it's a masterpiece,
but it just makes tea taste better.

477
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,479
Go ahead. Take a sip.

478
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,275
That's hot.

479
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,864
Dr. Yang, we're both graduates
of Hankuk National University, aren't we?

480
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,868
In short, we have a certain pedigree.

481
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,873
You should follow my lead
and enjoy a smooth ride all the way.

482
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,293
If you had to struggle from scratch
under that Muhan graduate

483
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,254
who has no background,
I would be disheartened.

484
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,925
-Dr. Han.
-Yes?

485
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,344
If this is about Dr. Baek's offer,

486
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,721
I am sorry.

487
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,726
I asked to see you today
for something else.

488
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,022
When my mentor gave me this teacup,

489
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,735
he said that one day
I'd find my own protégé to pass it on to.

490
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,071
Today, the teacup finds its new owner.

491
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,200
Me, sir?

492
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,661
You, sir.

493
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,845
-What the…
-Dr. Baek.

494
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,930
What are you doing?

495
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,057
-What do you need that for?
-That…

496
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,683
No! Please don't!

497
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,937
Have you lost your mind?!
What do you think you're doing?!

498
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,023
This should be a three-way meeting.

499
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:26,986
We said the three of us would meet
at four o'clock and discuss it together.

500
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,196
But

501
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,823
it's only 3:20 right now.

502
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,661
Why wait until then?
Let's speed things up and decide now!

503
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,746
I'd love that.

504
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,084
Fine. Take a seat.

505
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,211
How insolent.

506
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,046
Hey, Anus.

507
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,547
Sir?

508
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,676
Is it gonna be colorectal surgery
or trauma surgery?

509
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,221
The thing is…

510
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,975
Colorectal surgery, no doubt.

511
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,268
I've already taught him all the basics.

512
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,647
He'll start writing papers next year
and become an attending one day.

513
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,732
An attending?

514
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,109
Do you really believe him?

515
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,569
He's saying you owe him
two years of grunt work

516
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,446
for making you a specialist.

517
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,740
Why do you put
such a barbaric spin on things?

518
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,202
Do you even have a position
that you can hand him?

519
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,788
You can't just be handed
an attending position.

520
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:23,209
You need to be prepared
when the opportunity arises.

521
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,254
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

522
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,214
Even I can prepare him for such things.

523
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,925
Once I take him under my wing, let's see…

524
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,973
In about five years, he'll be
an eighth of the doctor that I am.

525
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,099
Five years?

526
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,268
I wonder why such a talented man

527
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,562
ended up going to Muhan University.

528
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,898
Your degree means nothing in the OR.

529
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,276
Dr. Baek, come clean.

530
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,485
Why are you here?

531
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,822
You're here to shed the label
of being a lowly Muhan graduate

532
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,115
and polish your résumé!

533
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,117
-Calm down, sir.
-"Polish my résumé"?!

534
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,327
-Are you done?!
-Stop it!

535
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,412
"Polish my résumé"?!

536
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,913
I'm not done talking!

537
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,292
You started talking smack first.

538
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,753
You keep jabbing at me
with all your talk of skills.

539
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,213
But I have something you'll never have.

540
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,381
An impressive résumé.

541
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,675
A medical degree
from Hankuk National University.

542
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,553
-Go on.
-Subspecialty in colorectal surgery.

543
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,388
-And?
-Subspecialty in colonoscopy.

544
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,391
Colorectal specialist certified
by the Ministry of Health.

545
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,018
Specialist in colorectal medicine.

546
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,146
Lifetime member
of the Korean Surgical Society.

547
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,107
Member of the Colorectal Research Society,
Columbia University.

548
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,159
MUHAN UNIVERSITY GRADUATE
FIRST ATTENDING SURGEON ROLE

549
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,413
Will he choose Han Yu-rim's credentials
or Baek Kang-hyuk's skills?

550
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,460
Dr. Yang is facing quite a dilemma.
He has to pick one.

551
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,588
So if all goes well,
he will be working with us.

552
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,507
Let's not get our hopes up.

553
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,634
I mean, it's no contest.

554
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,678
A head surgeon has more clout
than a newly appointed attending.

555
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,347
Right?

556
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,852
If I had to guess, Dr. Baek will end up
fighting tooth and nail all on his own

557
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,479
like Dr. Kwon did.

558
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,940
Shall we bet on it?

559
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,239
Winner gets 10,000 won?

560
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,450
You know,

561
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:24,455
the number of plaques I've received
from societies alone equals my age.

562
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,042
Jae-won, if you commit yourself
to your work,

563
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,545
you might reach great heights like me.

564
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,008
You don't have a single picture
taken with a patient.

565
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,468
What was that?

566
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,263
Is it hard to choose?

567
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,017
Yes, sir.

568
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,435
Why?

569
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,020
To be honest,

570
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,315
I'm not confident about trauma surgery.

571
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,029
You're not confident.

572
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,241
Yang Jae-won.

573
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,743
It's time to make a decision.

574
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,747
Colorectal or trauma?

575
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,670
Me or Baek Kang-hyuk?

576
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,213
I think, Dr. Han…

577
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,424
It's me, isn't it?

578
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,800
-I--
-Never mind.

579
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,387
Never mind.

580
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,892
You can't save lives
by weighing up all the odds like that.

581
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,353
Your hesitation
would cost patients their lives.

582
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,860
Don't worry about him.

583
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,825
-Where are you going?
-Wait, sir!

584
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,619
Yang Jae-won!

585
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,874
Just a moment!

586
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,792
Dr. Baek.

587
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,337
The thing is…

588
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,297
What I meant was…

589
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,760
I was wondering what I could do
as a trauma surgeon.

590
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,761
Isn't it obvious?

591
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,306
You'll go through what happened today
over and over again.

592
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,058
Then, eventually,

593
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,270
you'll be able to save lives
all on your own.

594
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,863
Are all those people…

595
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,367
Are they all patients you saved?

596
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,579
Rania.

597
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:34,418
Severe brain damage from the bombing
required eight hours of surgery.

598
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,088
The bombs kept falling,
and we were running low on blood.

599
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,089
Good job.

600
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,841
It was a tough battle for the little girl.

601
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,176
Did she live?

602
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,095
Her dream is to become a doctor.

603
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,395
That old man over there is Masoud.

604
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,649
He refused to be seen by any other doctor.

605
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,902
I don't trust him.
Bring me a Muslim doctor.

606
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,238
Goodness, you're a stubborn one, old man.

607
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,407
Keep quiet or your BP will drop.

608
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,410
What are you doing?

609
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,540
Finally, some peace and quiet.

610
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,086
He insisted on me becoming his son-in-law.

611
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,923
He wanted you to be part of his family.

612
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,431
Dr. Yang is a compassionate soul.

613
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,891
Try a more humane approach.

614
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,271
You…

615
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,569
Why did you want to become a doctor?

616
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,329
Perhaps…

617
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,292
you wanted to save lives, like me.

618
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,131
Yang Jae-won!

619
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,883
Dr. Yang.

620
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,093
I would give you this.

621
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,929
Why can't you see how I feel?
I want you to have this!

622
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,516
Dr. Han.

623
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,186
I think this teacup

624
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,188
belongs to someone else.

625
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,734
This is a celadon from the Goryeo dynasty.

626
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,819
Haven't you heard of Goryeo celadons?

627
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,737
Sir…

628
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,158
I choose trauma surgery!

629
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,744
No, you've got it all wrong.

630
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,663
Fellows don't get to choose
the specialty they want.

631
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,540
-They must do as they're told.
-Hey!

632
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,959
You said his decision would be final.

633
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,795
-But…
-All right, let's get to work.

634
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,171
Wait a second!

635
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,464
-Wait!
-I'm sorry, sir!

636
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,924
-Yang Jae-won!
-I'm sorry!

637
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,842
-I wish you the best, sir!
-Yang Jae-won!

638
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,844
Let go of me. Hands off!

639
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,098
-How dare you?
-What's wrong with you?

640
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,767
That teacup looks like a knockoff anyway.

641
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,520
Nonsense. You have no clue!

642
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,313
I'm pretty good with these things.

643
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,482
Goryeo celadons

644
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,401
aren't decorated this way.

645
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,113
You should get it checked in Insa-dong.

646
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,906
What do you know?

647
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,287
A knockoff?

648
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,833
A knockoff?!

649
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,212
Yang Jae-won.

650
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,880
That ungrateful bastard.

651
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,217
I doted on him dearly as a fellow alumnus.

652
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,177
He dares to betray me?

653
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,680
He dares to ditch me?

654
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,764
Me?!

655
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,142
Yang Jae-won!

656
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,603
Me?

657
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,159
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEND THE EMAIL?
YES

658
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,037
What is this?

659
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,080
What on earth?

660
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,133
What does it say?

661
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,071
All right, tell me! Spit it out!

662
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,741
Take deep breaths.
Do you remember Lamaze breathing?

663
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,412
Get to the point. I don't have time.

664
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,538
Hey!

665
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,040
The fellows are freaking out

666
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,125
about an email from Dr. Han.

667
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,293
A group email.

668
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,504
What about the group email?

669
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,673
From now on… Here. Just see for yourself.

670
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,384
-All right, let me see.
-I can't bring myself to say it.

671
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,387
"Starting today,

672
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,516
all Trauma Team on-call duties
are assigned to Yang Jae-won."

673
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,320
ALL TRAUMA TEAM ON-CALL DUTIES
ARE ASSIGNED TO YANG JAE-WON

674
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,364
Listen.

675
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,824
Go and beg like your life depends on it.

676
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,577
I can't do it! I won't do it!

677
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,497
All these on-call shifts
will be the death of you!

678
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,130
TRAUMA TEAM: YANG JAE-WON, YANG JAE-WON,
YANG JAE-WON, YANG JAE-WON, YANG JAE-WON

679
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,507
It's a death sentence.

680
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,194
Yes, Dr. Baek?

681
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,446
What's the matter? Did someone die?

682
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,948
-Are you crying?
-No.

683
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,909
But my funeral is coming up soon.

684
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:04,456
Dr. Han Yu-rim has assigned me
to all on-call duties for the Trauma Team.

685
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,086
What about it? In trauma surgery,
you're on call every day.

686
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,922
In Korea, one specialist must handle

687
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:16,343
all trauma patients,
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

688
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,095
Hey.

689
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,516
Don't tell me you didn't know
what you were signing up for.

690
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,651
You don't seem to know your place yet.

691
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,403
Hey, Anus!

692
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,619
Yes… Dr. Baek.

693
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,458
Those on-call duties,

694
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,462
I won't let you work them all by yourself.

695
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,050
I can't let you go around killing people.

696
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,638
Actually, this works in our favor.

697
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,681
You'll be on call anyway.

698
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,975
Thanks to that email,
the entire hospital knows

699
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,561
that we are busting our tails.

700
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:12,149
The best kind of hard work
is the kind everyone acknowledges.

701
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,988
Come on. It's time to check on the ICU.

702
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,281
But sir,

703
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,785
why did you choose me of all people?

704
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,666
It's simple.

705
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,501
You're a good runner.

706
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,928
Every time I saw you, you were running.

707
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,263
Running to save a patient.

708
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,361
I will make sure

709
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,032
you don't regret choosing me.

710
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,705
I'm going to make sure
you regret choosing trauma surgery.

711
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,924
By the way, Dr. Baek,

712
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,927
didn't you go to Syria with IMAFP?

713
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,012
What? Why do you ask?

714
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,558
But you mentioned Afghanistan
when we were in the helicopter.

715
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,479
Hey, never mind that.
Just reply to Dr. Han's email already.

716
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,901
Dear Dr. Han. This is Yang Jae-won.

717
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,280
Dr. Baek has asked me
to pass on a message.

718
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,575
He says the teacup
is an authentic Goryeo celadon.

719
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,747
Baek Kang-hyuk!

720
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,299
"Trauma Center." Sounds great!

721
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,135
-Anus, you just follow my lead.
-Yes, sir.

722
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,261
A round of applause!

723
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,151
I love money.

724
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,114
I wonder if Dr. Yang will last, though.

725
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,115
I know.

726
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,119
Double or nothing?

727
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,580
Deal.

728
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,835
That day, a deep conviction
nestled in my heart.

729
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,591
If I continue following Dr. Baek
and walk in his footsteps as I am now,

730
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,680
one day I will become a doctor
who saves lives just like him.

731
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:54,478
Both the Trauma Center
and my career as a doctor

732
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,563
are now at the starting line.

733
00:51:56,113 --> 00:52:01,118
