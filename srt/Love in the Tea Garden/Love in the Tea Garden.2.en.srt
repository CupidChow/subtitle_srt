[Xiufen's suffering]

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,310
Father died early, wicked stepmother
and spoiled brother.

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,430
What kind of melodrama script is this?

16
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,840
Never mind.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,510
I know you lost your memory.

18
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,710
Let me introduce myself directly.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,870
My name is Su Qiqi.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,920
I've been your best friend
since we were kids.

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,950
If you have any questions later,

22
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,950
just find me anytime.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,710
But I need to livestream soon,

24
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,510
so I need to go.

25
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,710
We're from the same village.

26
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,640
Why does everyone know me

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,710
except you?

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,640
I returned to the village a year ago,

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,590
and I haven't met everyone yet.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,510
Are you sure you want
to come back to this house?

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,840
I...

32
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,710
Xiufen?

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
You're back!

34
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,360
I have to tell mom the good news.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
Mom, Xiufen is back!

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,310
See?

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,310
They aren't completely heartless.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,870
Finally, someone is here
to do the chores.

39
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,360
We can sell the donkey now.

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,680
So I really am Xiufen.

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,310
I must have escaped this hell before.

42
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,680
Now, to regain my memory,

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,400
I have to jump back in.

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,190
Xiufen!

45
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,400
How shameless you are!

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,870
I'll teach you a lesson today.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,190
Let me.

48
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,680
What are you doing?

49
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,960
Mom!

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,030
I'm back!

51
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,560
You missed me, right?

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,750
You wretched girl, let go of me.

53
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,680
No!

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,520
No, I still want
to take good care of you.

55
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,870
Let go of me!

56
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,680
No!

57
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,560
Let go!

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,590
What secret is she hiding?

59
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,280
Why is Hydra going to such lengths
for her?

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
Calling me mom won't help.

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,680
You still have to do chores.

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,910
Ridiculous.

63
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,400
Ripped pants

64
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,840

65
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,120
Trying to escape?

66
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,310
Still not going?

67
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,310
Are you setting a fire?

68
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,390
Yes, I plan to end it all.

69
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,480
Didn't you say you'd help me?

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
I can't stay here any longer.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
Did you remember anything?

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
No.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,750
Why are you so invested

74
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,720
in me regaining my memory?

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,870
Wretched girl,
are you trying to kill me?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,190
Time is money.

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,870
Meaning,

79
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,800
Oh my god, you guys have no talent
for language at all.

80
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,120
What a fool.

81
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,190
Are you being racist, excuse me?

82
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,310
Learning English to us
is like a piece of cake.

83
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,800
But do you speak Chinese?

84
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Let me show you how talented

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,270
Chinese people can be

86
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,430
when it comes to learning a language.

87
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,600
Do you speak Korean?

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,240
Do you speak French?

89
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,390
Do you speak German?

90
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,040
Do you speak Japanese?

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm saying all this to tell you,

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,950
don't discriminate
against Chinese again.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,310
Wait,

94
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,560
aren't you a junior high school graduate?

95
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,560
Right.

96
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,600
Why does my language talent

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,190
seem embedded in my DNA?

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,750
Why?

99
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,680
Xiufen couldn't possibly know these.

100
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,600
Are you OK?

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,510
Loser.

102
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,920
You can't do anything right.

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
All the efforts put into raising you
were wasted.

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,430
You shouldn't have come back.

105
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,040
This is the house my mom left me.

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,950
Why can't I live here?

107
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,680
According to inheritance law,

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm the first in line to inherit.

109
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
You're the ones occupying my house.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
I can kick you out anytime.

111
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,270
You ungrateful wretch.

112
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,870
Could she be the one
who saved me back then?

113
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,120
Could you have grown up without me?

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,750
I've prepared this long ago.

115
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,070
I raised myself.

116
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
Be reasonable.

117
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,680
How dare you talk to my mom like that?

118
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,630
And you,

119
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,270
you failed college entrance exam
five times.

120
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,950
You even hired a private tutor.

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Tom is Mary?

122
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
You should spend money

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,390
checking up your brain.

124
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,120
So the folks were telling the truth.

125
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,750
Mom, Xiufen's personality changed

126
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,870
because she lost her memory
in an accident.

127
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,600
I wondered why you brought her back.

128
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,310
You're the culprit, right?

129
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,600
Don't slander a good person.

130
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,870
He saved me.

131
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,390
He didn't hit you?

132
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,950
Then why did he bring you back?

133
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,270
He's clearly guilty.

134
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,310
We need compensation.

135
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,190
You can be shameless,
but I still need my pride.

136
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,830
You!

137
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,310
Don't talk nonsense. Don't hit people.

138
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,390
Chief,

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,870
I don't want to live anymore.

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,310
He hit Xiufen.

141
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,310
And he wants to hit me, Chief!

142
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,870
I don't want to live.

143
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,510
I've investigated.

144
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,600
It has nothing to do with Mingyu.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,360
Xiufen's mom, apologize now.

146
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,430
Our village depends

147
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,800
on Mingyu's tea plantation to prosper.

148
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,950
But he slept with Xiufen.

149
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,150
Everyone saw it.

150
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,960
Exactly.

151
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,720
You ruined Xiufen's reputation.

152
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,360
How will she get married?

153
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,960
You have to take responsibility.

154
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,600
How should I be responsible?

155
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,750
Marry her.

156
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,150
The dowry won't be much,
just 200 thousand.

157
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,120
- You're daydreaming...
- Sure.

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,150
You can have the money.

159
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,360
But I'll take her.

160
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,240

161
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,720
I escaped the nightmare.

162
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,200
By the way, you have
a tea plantation, right?

163
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,960
I'll work for you to repay the money.

164
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
No rush.

165
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,150
Did you remember anything this time?

166
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,550
I can't remember anything.

167
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,840
Have you thought about

168

190
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,030
Take some buns,
you haven't eaten, right?

191
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,320
Try these buns.

192
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,790
Thank you.

193
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,720
They're delicious.

194
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,600
Thank you.

195
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,000
Is there a strange woman
in the village?

196
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,960
No.

197
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,150
Sir,

198
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,480
have you seen

199
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
a strange woman in the village?

200
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,320
Strange woman?

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,080
Mie Mie.

202
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,510
When will you pay the balance?

203
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,870
When will you pay the rent?

204
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,720
Let's settle it.

205
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,510
Refund your rent? Dream on.

206
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,750
Ungrateful wretch,

207
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,030
I've raised you for so long,

208
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,320
and you ask for a rent refund?

209
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,030
She's with me now.

210
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,480
If you keep pestering,

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,510
I guarantee you won't get a penny.

212
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,080
CEO talk plus a hug.

213
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,670
Is he discreetly

214
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,120
confessing to me?

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,150
Explain to me.

216
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,550
Sir, have you seen a strange woman?

217
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,390
No.

218
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,630
It's confirmed.

219
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,120
He

220
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
loves me.

221
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,480
Dang.

222
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,150
Is the countryside this open now?

223
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's go. She's not here.

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,720
Let's go.

225
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,080
That's thrilling.

226
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,960
What's your excuse this time?

227
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,510
I slipped.

228
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,080
Though I like straightforward people,

229
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,600
you're too blunt.

230
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,120
What do you mean?

231
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,080
Keep pretending.
