Stop looking so glum.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,510
He's just a crude farmer.

What I can offer you

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,310
is a thousand times better.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,430
Ye Xiyan,

18
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,950
be aware of your current status.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,510
You're now my fiancée.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,310
Mr. Cui,

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,640
there's someone here.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,350
Oh, who do we have here?

23
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,040
Just a watchdog.

24
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,040
Ye Xiyan,

25
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,560
there must be other ways

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,070
to solve Ye Group's crisis.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,310
I'll face it with you.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,310
Don't choose self-sacrifice.

29
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,350
Sacrifice?

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,760
Lu Mingyu,

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,360
she's the one who came to me.

32
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,560
These are all my choices.

33
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,360
It has nothing to do with you.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
Letting me stand aside

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,520
and watch you face all this alone

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,360
is the cruelest choice for me.

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,910
Enough.

38
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,030
We never belonged

39
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,080
to the same world.

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,150
My interest in you
was just a passing fling.

who likes to steal love.

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,310
It's more thrilling that way.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,910
What can a mere villager like you

50
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,120
do against me?

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,040

I've done everything you asked.

55
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,310
I hope you'll keep your promise.

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
That depends on your performance.

57
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,270
You better show some sincerity.

58
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,920

If you want that,

64
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,070

and financial teams.

Be good and wait for me.

74

Maybe there's another way.

75
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,120

I gave you a chance.

86

But you insisted on walking
the path of destruction.

Trying

88
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,200
to ask Lu Mingyu for help?

89
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,550
Perfect, I'm looking for him too.

90
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,960
This has nothing to do with him.

91
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,670
Nonsense!

92
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,270
Xiyan, he owes me too much.

93
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,670
It's time to settle

94
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,270
old and new grudges together.

95
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,910

Please, let him go.

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,360
Please, let him go.

It's OK. Don't be afraid.

100
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,510
Feeling sorry for him already?

101
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,030
Cui Zihao, if you have any guts,
come at me.

102
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240

Lu Mingyu!

105
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
You're stubborn.

106
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,870
No!

what'll it take for you to let him go?

109
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll agree to anything.

110
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,550
You know exactly what I want.

111
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,670
Alright, I'll agree

112
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,960
to anything you want.

113
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,720
Xiyan, don't listen to him.

114
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,960

No, no!

118
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,960
You would've ended up

119
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,030
like your partner long ago.

120
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,030
Cui Zihao, I beg you.

121
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,910
I beg you.

122
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,240
You finally admit it.

123
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,750
You caused Qiushui's death.

124
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,840
Yes, I killed her.

125
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,870
You just realized?

126
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,080
Now that things have reached this point,

127
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,200
you won't be able
to stir up any trouble.

128
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,150
Three years ago, I captured Ye Xiyan.

129
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,270
If it weren't for you,

130
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,030
I wouldn't have wasted three years.

131
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
But it's alright.

132
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,550

135
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,360
but you still haven't made
much progress.

136
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,150
You're pretending to be captured again?

137
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,150
Xiyan!

138
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,960
Don't move!

With the evidence in your safe,

142
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,720
you won't escape.

143
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,720
Why did you come?

144
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,750
Xiyan,

145
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,870
I know you too well.

146
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,030
You wanted to play along

147
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,720
to lower Cui Zihao's guard

148
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,550
and gather evidence
of his crimes, right?

149
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,720
This plan

150
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,390
needs to be more precise and convincing

151
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,270
to fully trap him.

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,910

this is a windfall

172
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,600

eagerly showing off to everyone.

183
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,630
You hid behind the scenes

184

trying to destroy Ye Group,

185
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,270
kidnapped me,

186
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,550
