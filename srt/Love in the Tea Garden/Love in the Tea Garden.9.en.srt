I thought she was your fiancée.

128
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,750
Now she's just a friend?

Are you a fraud?

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,830
It's just my wishful thinking.

and looked in many places,

138
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
but I couldn't find her.

139
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,960
So,

140
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,550
I claimed to be her fiancé

141
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,440
to make it easier to look for her.

142
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,960
But I told you,

143
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,510
I'm not the person you're looking for.

144
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,000
Since I couldn't find her,

145
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,000
seeing you is good enough.

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,480

166

I have to go out for a bit.

He has someone he likes.

179
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,790
Why am I getting angry here?

180
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,360
How come this looks exactly like the one

181
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,720

182
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,790
