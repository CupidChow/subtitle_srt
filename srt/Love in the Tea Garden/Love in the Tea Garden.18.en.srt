When I met her,

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,190
she wasn't Ye Xiyan yet.

118
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,430
She was just herself.

She's my only precious daughter.

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I didn't say anything.

128
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,440
You came on your own.

129
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,550
So what happened exactly?

130
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,600
