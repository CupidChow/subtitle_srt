returned to the countryside,

182
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,600
to take that step.

183
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
Nice.

184

190
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
get so rich?

191
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,270
It's very strange.

192
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,510
She exposed you in public,

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,360
stirred up villagers' resentment,

194
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,600
and destroyed the trust between us.

195
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,150
All of this

196
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,360
seems to be aimed at stopping you
from acquiring Guyan Village.

197
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,200
And the proposal of Ye Group,

198
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
how did she get it?

199
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,510
Someone must be behind this.

200
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,550
Do you have any suspects?

201
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,240
The chairman of Cui Group,

202
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,240
Cui Zihao's dad.

203
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,200
As far as I know, he also wants
to acquire Guyan Village.

204
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,960
I suspect,

205
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,360
even that car accident

206
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,440
is related to him.

207
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,840
Is it possible

208
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,720
the Hydra organization

209
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,550
is connected to Zihao's dad?

210
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,870
I told you to eliminate

211
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,360
Ye Xiyan quietly.

212
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,960
What did you do?

213
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
You've made this mess,

214
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,480
and forced me out into the open.

215
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
Sorry, Boss.

216
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,960
We just found out

217
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,960
that Lu Mingyu

218
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
is the bodyguard

219
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,510
who destroyed our entire
overseas division years ago.

220
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,390
It's him.

221
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,720
I'm telling you,

222
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,150
this time, we must not let him escape.

223
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,030
Dad,

224
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
what did you just say?

225
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,720
Lu Mingyu is that bodyguard?

226
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,750
You just realized?

227
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,150
I thought you went to the countryside
to get close to him

228
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,720
because you had already suspected
and planned it.

229
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,870
This time, I went to the countryside

230
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,720
to prevent you from doing anything

231
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,030
harmful to Xiyan again.

232
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,630
Operation suspended.

233
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,670
Await further instructions.

234
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,240
Yes.

235
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,150
Wait...

236
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,630
Cui Group and Ye Group

237
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,510
have fought for decades.

238
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,960
You're not planning to let a woman

239
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
become an obstacle

240
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,960
to our group's success, are you?

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
I do like Xiyan,

242
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,670
but I know what I want.

243
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,390
I have my plans.

244
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,440
Hello, dad?

245
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,150
What?

246
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,630
There's trouble at the company?

247
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,550
OK, I'll be back immediately.

248
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,550
There's trouble at the company.
I need to go back.

249
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,480
I'll drive you

250
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,840
as an all-day bodyguard included.

251
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,270
