13
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:12,950
Xiyan,

14
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,510
I'm here to take you home.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,120
This wretched place

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,590
isn't worth staying.

17
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,040
You're just leaving like this?

18
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,280
- Xiyan!
- Xiyan!

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,950
What are you doing?

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,790
I dare any of you to touch her!

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,710
Zihao,

22
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,590
this is between me and them.

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,790
It has nothing to do with you.

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,400
I know you're angry right now.

25
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,150
I betrayed your trust.

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,350
I was too eager for success,

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,760
and I hurt your feelings.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
Who said we were angry?

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,840
Even if you're not Xiufen,

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
so what?

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,750
Your identity might be fake,

33
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,190
but the things you've done for us

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,840
are real!

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,560
That's right.

36
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,750
You exposed the fraud,

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,360
organized the village evening party,

38
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,680
and helped me and my dad
resolve our conflict.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,310
At the trade fair,

We all recognize you as one of us
in Guyan Village.

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,710
Yes.

45

- That's right.
- That's right.

46
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,910
We all do. Exactly.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,520
Don't leave.

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,240
This is your home now.

Don't go. Yes!

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,710
Don't go!

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,710

54

No problem. What's mine is yours.

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,870
Stay as long

56
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,680
as you want.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,870
Lu Mingyu probably won't forgive me.

58
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,240
Put myself in his shoes.

59

If I were him,

60
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,590
I'd block

61
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,120
and delete someone like me from my life.

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,430
Well, it does make you

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,630
sound like

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,910
a heartless cheater.

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,630
Wait a second.

66

Don't worry, friend.

67
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,400
I understand the pain of a breakup.

70
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,720
why is everyone acting so strange?

71
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,720
Why is everyone looking at me like that?

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,800
Nothing's wrong.
You're just overthinking it.

73
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,830
Everyone's acting weird.

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,390
I'm announcing

75
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
Lu Mingyu and I

76
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,830
are officially breaking up today.

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,920
I don't remember us ever being together.

78
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,830

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,510
Don't hide inside and stay silent.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,870
I'm right behind you.

82
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,480
Why won't you see me?

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,870
Why have we become like this?

84
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,870
No!

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
Where are you, Lu Mingyu?

86
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
From now on,
don't let her drink anymore.

87
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,270
Lu Mingyu,

88
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,830
I was just saying those things
out of anger.

89
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,870
Look here,

90
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,830
these are all the memories of our love.

91
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,360
Have you forgotten them?

92
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,720
We're not that close.

93
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,190
- Not close.
- Not close.

94
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,240
Lu Mingyu must be so fed up with me.

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,870
Xiyan.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,430
Xiyan.

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,680
Take a walk with me nearby, OK?

98
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
I want to talk to you.

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,160
Actually, this is a good opportunity

100
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,120
to test Mingyu.

101
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,870
Wait for me to assist you.

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
Mingyu,

103
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,120
are you still mad at Xiyan?

104
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,310
I haven't been mad for a while.

105
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,680
It's just,

106
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,070
without pretending to be a couple,

107
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,000
I have no reason to keep her around.

108
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,750
Besides, I have my own troubles.

109
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,190
I don't want to drag her down.

110
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,360
I don't know

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,830
if I'm capable of making her happy.

112
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,560
Everything's set. Ready to go.

113
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,560
Mingyu,

114
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,510
you missed your chance.

115
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,720
Where did this photo come from?

116
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,920
From Cui Zihao's social media.

117
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,240
I went undercover for you
and added him as a friend.

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,430
What's his hand doing?

119
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm not blind.

120
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,510
Where is this?

121
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,830
Let me see.

122
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,720
What now?

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,560
Look at the love tree behind Xiyan.

124
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,240
This place is famous for matchmaking.

125
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,480
Couples go there to pray

126
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,830
for a happy relationship.

127
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,160
Look at Xiyan's smile.

128
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
It's genuine.

129
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,600
She's genuinely happy.

130
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,750
You mean...

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,190
Xiyan

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,430
has moved on.

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,560
What?

134
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,560
In just one day, she's already over it.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,390
Women...

136
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,560
are fickle, after all.

137
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,240
How could she choose him over me?

138
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,240
Cui Zihao isn't better than me.

139
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,240
If I can't make her happy,

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,360
neither can he.

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,030
Wait, I'll go with you.

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,240
Plan successful. Operation continues.

144
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,480
What's making you so happy?

Hey, buddy, take a picture for us.

153
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,550
Why does he keep taking pictures?

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,390

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,510
I can represent Cui Group in investing
in Ye Group.

the only possibility between Cui Group

168
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,390
