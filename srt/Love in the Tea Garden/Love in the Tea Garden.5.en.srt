Here.

190
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,390
Did you scan the code?

191
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,270
And you?

192
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,080
Don't worry.

193
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Everyone will get one.

194
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,670
Hold onto it.

195
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,790
Scan the code first.

196
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,270
Here, this is yours.

197
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,000
Yours.

198
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,440
Here you go.

199
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,080
I didn't expect

200
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,790
you also know about marketing.

201
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,080
I don't.

202
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,120
I just suddenly thought of this idea.

203
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,320
Mainly because you helped me.

204
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,080
Mr. Zhao and my dad

205
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,360
are here.

206
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,320
Dad.

207
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,360
What?

208
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,080
Mr. Zhao.

209
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,080
What are you doing?

210
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,840
Avoiding the sun.

211
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,870
Mr. Zhao, take a look.

212
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,600
These are

213
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,270
our village's specialty products.

214
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,200
Wait, who is this person?

215
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,910
I don't remember him.

216
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,480
Chief Jiang,

217
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,510
what do you mean by this?

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,720
Do you really think this trash

219
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,510
is worthy of a partnership
with Ye Group?

220
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,910
[Board Members of Ye Group]
Come on, please reconsider.

221
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,790
These products

222
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,390
have great market potential.

223
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,630
Unless

224
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,960
you agree to the conditions
I mentioned yesterday.

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,790
Chief,

226
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,750
let me have a word with Mr. Zhao.

227
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,510
Alright.

228
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,270
Please.

229
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,240
Chief.

230
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,150
Chief, you've been deceived.

231
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,910
This Mr. Zhao

232
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,480
is a complete fraud,

233
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,910
with no ties to Ye Group.

234
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,910
What are you talking about?

235
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,390
What are you talking about?

236
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,120
Who do you think you are,

237
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
to question and slander me?

238
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,790
The legal department at Ye Group

239
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,080
won't let this slide.

240
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,750
Wait for the lawyer's letter.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Mr. Zhao, calm down.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,150
There might be a misunderstanding.

243
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,550
You'd better show some respect.

244
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,910
Let go of me.

245
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,550
What are you doing?

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,390
Can such an important deal

247
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,510
be solely decided by you?

248
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,630
Our CEO has given me
full authority to handle it.

249
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,510
Really?

250
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,910
Here is the publicly listed phone number

251
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,960
of Ye Group's investment department.

252
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,080
Want to verify?

253
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,910
So,

254
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,600
what have you done?

255
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,270
You'd better confess,

256
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,960
or you can't bear the consequences.

257
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,320
I was indeed a former employee
of Ye Group.

258
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,080
But I was fired.

259
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,960
It's all my fault, blinded by greed.

260
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,790
I've done stupid things.

261
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,670
I'm sorry, everyone.

262
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,510
I'm sorry,

263
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,270
Alright, the misunderstanding
is cleared up.

265
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,200
This has nothing to do

266
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,240
with Ye Group.

267
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,120
Let me tell you,

268
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,670
a company's nature decides
the people it hires.

269
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,270
Those in subordinate positions follow
the example set by their superiors.

270
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,080
Ye Group must be no good either.

271
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,360
Big companies are always shady.

272
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,000
How can we compete with them?

273
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,840
Let's just take care of our own
piece of land.

274
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,960
Don't trust them.

275
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,910
This incident has caused
significant damage.

276
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,000
It seems the acquisition
and renovation plan

277
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,910
for Guyan Village still has
a long way to go.
