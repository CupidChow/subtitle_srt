[Episode 20]

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,870
I didn't expect it to be so successful.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,280
The inventory is all cleared out.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,870
Of course.

16
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,070
After all, I'm
a successful businesswoman.

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,120
You really are my lucky star.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,480
So this is how you roast tea.

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,590
Yes, do you want to learn?
I'll teach you.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,920
Come on.

21
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,400
Traditional hand-roasted tea involves

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,350
the steps of de-enzyming, rolling,

23
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,230
re-roasting and baking.

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,230
I know.

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,480
De-enzyming means

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,150
quickly evaporating the moisture
in the tea leaves,

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,920
inhibiting fermentation
and locking in the aroma of the tea.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,230
Let me try it myself.

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,920
OK.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,640
You need to go faster
with the tossing. Faster.

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,590
Be careful not to burn your hands.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you OK?

the first jar of tea
we roasted together.

I learned about this

can kill the entire tea plants.

What about our goods?

I thought you've been working together
for so many years,
