Let him paint.

192
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,200
- Let him paint.
- Let the kid paint.

193
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,270
Let the kid paint.

194
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,960
I'm very touched.

195
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,870
You all are good kids.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,790
Dad.

197
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,750
Bravo!

198
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,510
Look,

199
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,510
they are hugging.

200
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,200
This is the fusion of their love.

201
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,960
This is the call of the heart.

202
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,320
Father's love is like a mountain.

203
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,840
Long live understanding.

204
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,790
Bravo!

205
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,360
Long live understanding.

206
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,840
But,

207
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,840
no.

208
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,360
Painting can only be

209
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,790
a hobby.

210
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,390
Alright.

211
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,600
That's a big step forward already.

212
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,670
Mingyu,

213
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,000
Xiufen,

214
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,080
Qiqi,

215
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,790
thank you.

216
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,360
Dad.

217
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
Come on everyone,

218
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,030
