Seventy orders?

190
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,910
Keep it up.

191
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,750
Seventy orders, can you finish them?

192
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,510
No problem.

193
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,240
Miss Ye, how's business today?

194
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,550
I just discussed
with a few foreign clients.

195
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,390
Very likely in the near future,

196
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,720
our Guyan Tea

197
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,870
will go global.

198
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,670
Looks like I'll need

199
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,670
to hold on to you in the future.

200
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,390
Of course, you must hold on tight.

201
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,120
Don't let go.

202
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm not, and never will.

203
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,390
Hello?

204
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,910
