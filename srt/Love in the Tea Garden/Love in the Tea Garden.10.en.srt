You're not welcome here.

187
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,440
Fine.

188
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,550
You're hiding your true strength.

189
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
It seems we need
to get to know each other again.

190
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,480
My name is Lu Mingyu,

191
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,870
Xiufen's fiancé.

192
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,720
Remember that.

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,750
Mingyu, how are things going
with Xiufen?

194
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,360
Not bad.

195
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,080
Xiufen,

196
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,360
you're really into him, huh?

197
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,320
What? I'm just enjoying the view.

198
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,910
Didn't you say you had something
to talk to me about?

199
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,030
Yes.

200
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,510
My short video account

201
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,870
hasn't been getting much traffic.

202
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,200
I really don't know what to do.

203
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,440
Your problem is

204
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,000
you're always

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,150
copying other people's styles.

206
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,870
You should have

207
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,600
your own unique style as Su Qiqi.

208
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,720
That's right.

209
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,080
Then give me some advice.

210
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,150
I want to ask a question.

211
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,910
I have a friend

212
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,960
who has a crush on the girl
he grew up with.

213
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,200
What do you think his chances are?

214
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,550
Do you like Su Qiqi?

215
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,960
Is it that obvious?

216
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,600
Your rate of success

217
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,510
is proportional to your effort.

218
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,790
You have to work hard.

219
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,080
For example, you could do

220
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,790
a series on traditional culture
in modern life.

221
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,630
There's a traditional painting
in Mingyu's study.

222
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,600
I'll bring it over for you.

223
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,550
Alright.

224
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,030
Xiufen!

225
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,550
Are you OK?

226
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,030
I'm fine.

227
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,320
But where did these flowers come from?

228
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,150
I bought them.

229
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
Do you like them?

230
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,510
Create a crisis if there's none.

231
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,910
I've learned that.

232
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,000
Qiqi, watch out.

233
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,870
It seems not everyone can do this.

234
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,720
Jiang Shengsheng!

235
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,270
Su Qiqi,

236
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,870
I didn't do it on purpose.

237
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,960
I saw you spill it.

238
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,030
And you say it wasn't on purpose!

239
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,200
You, stop there!

240
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
I really didn't do it on purpose.

241
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,510
