00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,750
how is Chairman Ye recently?

196
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,910
Uncle Lu, my dad is doing well.

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,150
Thank you for your concern.

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,750
Miss Ye,

200
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
I heard you're very skilled in tea art.

201
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,750
Could we have the honor

202
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,320
of seeing your skills?

203
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,550
Yes.

204
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,320

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,910
This way, everyone.

206
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,080
Take a look at our Guyan Tea.

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,000
You can try it.

210
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,960
No problem.

211
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,080
Let's use Guyan Tea then.

212
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,000
- OK.

213
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,510
This smells so good.

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,080
Yes, I can smell it too.

215
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,510
I can already smell the tea aroma.

216
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,910
It's indeed professional.

217
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,390
Everyone, please enjoy the tea.

218
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
How does it taste?

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,080
Exactly.

220
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,080
Try it now.

221
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,270
It smells so good, it must be good tea.

222
