Fraud.

188
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,510
Fraud.

189
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,030
What are you doing?

190
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,200
Fraud.

191
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,440
Why did you

192
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,360
do this to us?

193
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,080
Xiyan,

194
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,000
it's really you.

195
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,270
Are you alright?

196
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,080
Is what Xiufen's mom said just now

197
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,870
really true?

198
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,440
I want to hear it from you.

199
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,440
I admit at first,

200
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,150
I pretended to have amnesia

201
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,960
and impersonated Xiufen

202
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,200
to acquire the tea plantation.

203
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,360
So at the beginning,

204
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,000
you were willing to come with me

205
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,740
all because of the tea plantation?

206
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,860
Yes.

207
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,360
So you watched me like a clown,

208
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,360
performing a one-man show,

209
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,870
step by step achieving your goal?

210
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,360
At first,

211
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,440
at first, it was all fake,

212
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,390
and insincere.

213
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,270
But later, didn't you feel

214
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,360
those real,

215
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
beautiful moments?

216
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,600
Maybe it was too beautiful.

217
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,670
I don't know when it was sincere

218
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,790
and when it was fake.

219
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,790
Now that the truth is out,

220
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,150
we have no reason

221
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,200
to pretend to be a couple anymore.

222
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,720
