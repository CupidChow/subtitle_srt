00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,333
Come out and receive your guests!

2
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,416
Don't mess with my property!

3
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,583
Hello, everyone!

4
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,333
I'm Nakrob, the house flipper!

5
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,250
HOUSE FOR SALE

6
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>I renovate deserted houses</i>

7
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,083
<i>into amazing ones.</i>

8
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,125
<i>I can turn a rat's nest</i>

9
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,333
<i>into heaven!</i>

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,625
Uncle Choke.

11
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:15,750
Choke!

12
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,958
What?!

13
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,666
It'll dry soon.

14
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,250
Darn it, Suakrong.
Who told you to store them like that?

15
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,083
Dad said,

16
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,333
"Just stuff them in."

17
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,541
"Nakrob won't know."

18
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,625
"He's plain stupid."

19
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,291
"Trust your dad."

20
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,708
Suakrong, you dumbass.
You memorized it word for word?

21
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,750
Hey.

22
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,125
Don't worry.
Everything will be done by tomorrow.

23
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,333
- Are they coming today?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,375
Time's up then.

25
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,875
Sorry.

26
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,833
It's not for sale anymore, sir.

27
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,875
Well, this house looks so wonderful,

28
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,791
I just want to live here myself.

29
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,416
But I like you!

30
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
If you also like this house…

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,208
then maybe we can talk.

32
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,833
NAKROB DEVELOPMENT CO., LTD.

33
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,166
HAPPY NEW YEAR

34
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,833
Lyn, girl.

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,333
Is he really gonna propose to you today?
It won't fall through again?

36
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,583
Does your brain have no filter?

37
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,125
It's going to be today for sure.
Just you wait, bridesmaid.

38
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,500
If I'm your bridesmaid,
I can meddle, right?

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,875
You're an architect, you know.
Come work for me.

40
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,583
You'd have better pay and a better life.

41
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,500
Way better than working with this scammer.

42
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,416
I wonder if there's still time
to change my bridesmaid.

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,833
I've told you, he's not a scammer anymore.

44
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,458
Respect, girl. Bless your trusting heart.

45
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,916
We opened this company together.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,416
And this bank account here is
in both of our names. See?

47
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,833
NAKROB PRASITCHOKE
AND LALYN PRACHAJARUS

48
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,333
If you loved someone,

49
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,958
wouldn't you want to grow together?

50
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,416
Done deal.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,041
Did you forget something?

52
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,208
Where do I have to sign?

53
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,875
Goodness gracious, jerk!

54
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,916
You didn't get caught
scamming again, right?

55
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,666
I just repainted the floor.
It's all nice and new.

56
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,666
The door faces south.

57
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,416
A nice breeze passes through all day.

58
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,541
Well, we're already in our thirties.
We have to look after ourselves, right?

59
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,083
I'm only 25.

60
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,875
As for Cheer here, she's 24.

61
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,708
I'll be 25 at the end of the year.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,041
Ominous times.

63
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,208
Don't forget your mouth.

64
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,208
Oh, yes. That's right.

65
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,625
Let's go somewhere else.

66
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,000
Hold on, babe.

67
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,166
This place is a million baht cheaper
than the others.

68
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,333
One and a half million.

69
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,083
That's right, one mil--

70
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,625
Secondhand homes
choose their owners, right?

71
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,625
And this house has chosen you!

72
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,791
A gecko warning.

73
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,625
The ball is in your court.

74
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,666
Hello.

75
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,208
Brother.

76
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,416
I want to buy the house.

77
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,666
To buy the house?

78
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,125
This Chinese client
wants to buy the house.

79
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,750
I'm here to look at the house.

80
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,750
I'm in a rush to buy a house.

81
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,541
Um, this couple is still considering.

82
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,166
That's all I've prepared.

83
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,541
Say something.

84
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,708
Quoting a China Dolls song?

85
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,000
What the heck was that?

86
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,833
He's ready to go through
with the transaction.

87
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,416
He's got the money
to go ahead with the sale.

88
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,958
He's not going to give in.

89
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,958
You gotta decide now!

90
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,750
- What do you think, babe?
- It's all up to you.

91
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,791
- What would you like to do?
- Think it over.

92
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,208
The choice is yours.

93
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,458
What will it be, sir?

94
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,625
I've decided.

95
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,083
500,000!

96
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,500
I'll shave off another 500,000!

97
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,250
500,000!

98
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,500
Dude, you're missing out!

99
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,583
You fool!

100
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,500
Damn it.

101
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,458
I know what you're waiting for.

102
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,458
But believe me,
everything will get better.

103
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,791
Hey, mind your own business.

104
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,000
Happy New Year, Ti.

105
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,583
Hey.

106
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,250
Bro, don't!

107
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,208
Stay still! Don't struggle!

108
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,666
Hey!

109
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,750
Pay up

110
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,708
so we can continue
doing business together.

111
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,416
If I don't get the money,
you know what's gonna happen.

112
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh my God!

113
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,333
It's gonna sound kinda like that.

114
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,166
No one's buying the house,

115
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,125
so I'm having money problems, but…

116
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,083
- What are you doing?
- Don't butt in.

117
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,083
Bro!

118
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,375
Give him our savings.

119
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,541
- No.
- I wasn't asking for your opinion.

120
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,958
If you die, then our wedding savings
will be meaningless.

121
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
Believe me one more time, Lyn.

122
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,125
I'll do whatever it takes
to make our dreams come true.

123
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,625
I'm just not sure how long
I can wait anymore.

124
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,416
Please give me one last chance.

125
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,583
I promise it will happen.

126
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,458
THE OTHER HALF OF DREAMS NEEDS MONEY

127
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,750
It's such an honor.

128
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,583
What's next?

129
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,333
Didn't you promise Lyn?

130
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,791
I don't know.

131
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,833
All I know is that

132
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,041
I don't want only 500,000.

133
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
I'm going to give five million to Lyn
for her dowry.

134
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,500
Bullshit!

135
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,500
You invested two million per house
and you've only made 50,000.

136
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,291
That's 100 houses you've gotta flip.

137
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,125
Lyn's gonna die an old maid.

138
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,375
LISTINGS

139
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,291
If houses bring in small profits,

140
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,958
then let's try going big, boss.

141
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,708
What nonsense are you spouting?

142
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,875
We can't even manage a detached house.

143
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,458
That's true.

144
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,625
Right?

145
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,583
The bigger it is,
the more money we'll make.

146
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,083
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS FOR SALE

147
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,375
Boss, I was joking.

148
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,291
"Urgent sale."

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,708
"Sukhee Nirun Hotel, Takua Pa, Phang Nga."

150
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,916
"Twenty million baht. Negotiable."

151
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,458
I'm begging you, bruh.

152
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,166
Don't even think about it!

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,583
TAKUA PA, PHANG NGA

154
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,625
Excuse me.

155
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,708
How can I get to the Sukhee Nirun Hotel?
It's not showing up on the GPS.

156
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,625
You wanna die?

157
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,500
What did you say?

158
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,958
You wanna die?!

159
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,458
You jerk! I'm speaking nicely to you.

160
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,416
Hey, stop.

161
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,125
He said, "You wanna die?!"

162
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,416
What's up?

163
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,875
Whoa, a gang.

164
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,208
What is it?

165
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,500
Bruh, he was only asking a question.
He wasn't looking for trouble.

166
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,416
Why do you want to go there?

167
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,416
Go if you wanna die. It's over there.

168
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,250
Shit.

169
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:14,041

LAND FOR SALE, HOTEL FOR SALE

174
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,416
- You're Mr. Nakrob, right?
- Yes.

175
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

176
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,833
I'm Tao, your real estate agent.

177
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,916
I see.

178
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,583
This way, please.

179
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,625
Just a second, sir.

180
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,791
This way.

181
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,375
It's a bit dark.

182
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,750
If I had enough money, I'd buy it myself.

183
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,750
Take a look. It's tastefully decorated.

184
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,083
The previous owner did it.

185
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,541
They loved this place very much.

186
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,791
Shall we continue? This way.

187
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,125
This won't scare me.

188
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,000
This way?

189
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,125
What do you think?

190
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,041
Just a sec, sir.

191
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,791
If the previous owner
really loved this place,

192
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,125
why has it changed hands so many times
and been left empty?

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,583
Some things are just waiting
for the right person.

194
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,083
Someone with a good eye.

195
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,500
Someone with good taste
like you, Mr. Nakrob.

196
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,208
Blind me, will you?

197
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,583
The second floor is even more beautiful.

198
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,916
Let's go.

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,333
Follow me.
We'll go up to the second floor.

200
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,583
Again?

201
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,916
This way, over here.

202
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,333
Be careful.

203
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,375
<i>This hotel has four floors.</i>

204
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,791
It has a total of 80 rooms.

205
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,708
All in all, there isn't much work to do.

206
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,000
Everything's pretty much
in good condition.

207
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,958
The next floor is the fourth floor.

208
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,416
This way.

209
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,000
- Shit!
- Shit what?!

210
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,166
I mean, superb.
All the rooms on this floor are awesome.

211
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,375
Here's the suite.

212
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,500
- Let's go back downstairs, sir.
- Oh, won't we…?

213
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,833
We can continue talking about the details.
You can check the lights downstairs.

214
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:20,875
In the electrical room.

215
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:21,875
Let's go.

216
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,958
I know you want to do this for Lyn.

217
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,750
But don't you wonder why
no one's bought it?

218
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,458
Because it's haunted.

219
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,500
I see.

220
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,083
Shit!

221
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,750
For this price, even if there were
ten ghosts, I'd take it.

222
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,708
- Are you afraid of ghosts?
- Hey. Of course, I am.

223
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,250
It's ghosts we're talking about.

224
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,250
Has anyone ever died because of ghosts?

225
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,041
I totally understand.

226
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,541
But this is even worse than a hoax.

227
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,125
This is hocus-pocus.

228
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,708
Let me ask you this then.

229
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,250
Where are you going to get the money from?

230
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,208
There's only one option left.

231
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,375
- I'll borrow from Ti again.
- Hey!

232
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,875
Are you telling me
to ditch this opportunity?

233
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,333
If we succeed, we'll be filthy rich.

234
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,083
Ever heard the phrase
"turning the tables"?

235
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,750
It looks more like

236
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,708
burning the tables.

237
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,916
Being in the same profession, let me ask.

238
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,375
Someone's died here, right?

239
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,333
That would probably be me.

240
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,583
The first time I saw this place,
it was really beautiful.

241
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,041
I almost had a heart attack.

242
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,875
And…

243
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,541
What about ghosts? Are there any?

244
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,083
Nope.

245
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,333
Is that a Buddhist amulet you're wearing?

246
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,583
That's the fashion nowadays.
I'm just following the trend.

247
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,500
- I've run into one.
- Into what?

248
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,125
- A ghost.
- Where?

249
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,750
- There.
- There's nothing there except curtains.

250
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,583
- What about that?
- What?

251
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,833
An authentic French lamp.

252
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,833
- I can sense it.
- Sense what?

253
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,833
- There's something here.
- There's nothing, sir.

254
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,000
There's a ghost.

255
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Since we're in the same profession,
I really mean it.

256
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,291
I'm not tricking you
into buying a haunted house.

257
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,500
Only really bad agents would do that.

258
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,833
Locals would call them shitheads.

259
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,458
Shit! I'm already afraid! I'm innocent!

260
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,541
I'm just an agent. Sorry.

261
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,291
See?

262
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,208
If there aren't any ghosts,
what are you afraid of?

263
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,000
There's nothing to stress about.
Even if there is one, it's fine.

264
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:49,958
I like this place.

265
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,041
Okay. So about the documents…

266
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,083
- Fifteen million.
- Twenty, sir.

267
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,125
Ten million.

268
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,375
You took off five just like that?

269
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,625
I can't sell it for ten.

270
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,791
The agency would have my head.

271
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,125
The agency won't say anything.

272
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,041
If you can sell this place at all,
they'd only praise you.

273
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,166
I saw the pile
of "for sale" signs outside.

274
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,041
I really can't.
I'd be making a loss at ten.

275
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,666
If that's the case,
then I guess this place isn't for me.

276
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,166
It's fine. Well then, please excuse me.

277
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,333
Let's go.

278
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,958
Are you just gonna leave?

279
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,166
You must be waiting for me
to stop you, huh?

280
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,416
Fine. Ten. Is it a deal?

281
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,750
Deal.

282
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:55,750
1 WEEK LATER

283
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,416
What the hell is this?

284
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,291
Hey, Suakrong.

285
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,875
You said your dad had already
cleared the front.

286
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,083
I can't trust Uncle Choke with anything.

287
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,250
How can you all just pack up and leave?

288
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,708
Come back! You can't just
hang me out to dry like this!

289
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,166
You, come here.

290
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,166
You're the foreman
so take responsibility for this!

291
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,500
I'm not the foreman, sir.

292
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,000
Huh? Then who are you?

293
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,583
I live around here. I heard the commotion
and came to check things out.

294
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,958
Damn it.

295
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,750
- Then who's the foreman?
- That'd be me.

296
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,541
- I'm the assistant foreman.
- Who asked you?!

297
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,458
- Great. You have to take responsibility.
- Take responsibility for what?

298
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,416
You haven't even paid us.
Plus, there's a ghost.

299
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,833
- What are you waiting for? Let's go.
- Hey, what about my work?

300
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,000
- Leave some of your men!
- I'm coming too.

301
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,833
Who are you?
Why do I have to wait for you?

302
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,083
Can you drop me off at the main road?
Drop me off up there.

303
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,541
I'll get off at the main road.

304
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,625
So stressed!

305
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,500
So?

306
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,791
They said they saw a ghost.

307
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,541
I told them I'd raise their wages,
but they said no.

308
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,958
Boss, I already warned you that
this place was haunted.

309
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,791
If that's true,
why didn't you see anything?

310
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,916
I was drunk

311
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,541
and fell dead asleep.

312
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,416
Uncle, did they tell you
what kind of ghost they saw?

313
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,750
A female ghost.

314
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,916
With really long hair

315
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,166
and really skinny?

316
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,291
For shit's sake!

317
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,500
Delivery!

318
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,916
Can't you come like normal people?

319
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,291
Locals call me Jie-Pen.

320
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,708
"Jie" which means "older sister."

321
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,208
Hurry up.

322
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,541
Isn't the food for the workers?

323
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,208
I was trying to get your attention,
but no one came out.

324
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,500
I'm all wet now.

325
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,791
Hurry and pay up.

326
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,250
I don't want to stay here
longer than I have to.

327
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,458
Why not, Auntie?

328
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,416
I mean, Jie?

329
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,750
If you want to know,
then come to my karaoke bar.

330
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,500
Do you want your money?

331
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,333
Yeah.

332
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,166
If so, then tell us.

333
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,791
Fine then.

334
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:52,416
Actually, I don't know much.

335
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,458
In the past, back in 1994…

336
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,625
I was still young and beautiful.

337
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,791
My body…

338
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,250
Auntie.

339
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:12,750
When construction had just finished,
I came to work here.

340
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:17,125
Back then, the hotel's owners
were Mrs. Lalita

341
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,958
and Mr. Ong-ard.

342
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,875
Lalita?

343
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,375
LAND DEED

344
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,333
"Mrs. Lalita Phopsuknirun."

345
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,625
<i>Mrs. Lalita was the daughter</i>
<i>of a quarry owner.</i>

346
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:33,833
<i>She was the richest</i>
<i>and most beautiful woman in town.</i>

347
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:37,708
<i>As for Mr. Ong-ard, he was from Bangkok.</i>

348
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:42,833
<i>I'm not sure how, but they got married.</i>

349
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,166
<i>Mrs. Lalita's dad was furious</i>
<i>when they got married.</i>

350
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,333
<i>But Mrs. Lalita wasn't playing around.</i>

351
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,541
<i>She cut ties with her family.</i>

352
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,291
<i>She started this hotel with Mr. Ong-ard.</i>

353
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,541
SUKHEE NIRUN HOTEL

354
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,208
<i>May I invite my lady inside?</i>

355
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,250
If they were so in love with each other,

356
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:13,958
then what's with this?

357
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,500
I found it in the storeroom.

358
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,208
That's…

359
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,000
Mrs. Lalita.

360
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,333
Look over there.

361
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,500
Do you see that room up over there?

362
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,625
One night, for unknown reasons,

363
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,666
Mrs. Lalita got riled up

364
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,083
and sliced Mr. Ong-ard's neck,
killing him.

365
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,916
She then killed herself too in that room.

366
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,166
My goodness.

367
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,041
By the time anyone found the bodies,

368
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,875
rats had gnawed at them.

369
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,625
The bodies were all decomposed.

370
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,125
The locals say

371
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,791
that Mrs. Lalita really loves this hotel

372
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:57,791
and won't go anywhere.

373
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,666
Careful, or you'll choke on the amulet.

374
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,000
- Wait.
- What?

375
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,291
I heard when you stay at a hotel,

376
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,583
you should knock
to greet the owner properly first.

377
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,875
That way, Mrs. Lalita will know
we're not trespassing.

378
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,375
What is it?

379
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,625
You're knocking too hard.

380
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,125
Nammon's the guy who's knocking.

381
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,708
Bruh, if I were a ghost,
I'd break your neck first.

382
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,125
Watch me.

383
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:46,875
Ouch!

384
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,083
Do you call that a knock?

385
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,375
It's so soft, who would know you're here?

386
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,083
Put yourself in her shoes.
If I were a ghost, I'd be annoyed.

387
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,958
The one who's annoyed is me.

388
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,791
If you're gonna let anyone know,
it'd be me.

389
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,541
This is my room!

390
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,666
These scaredy cats are takin' up my space.

391
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,166
Boss, I'll feel safer sleeping with you.

392
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,583
This place is freaky.

393
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,541
The workers might have really
seen something.

394
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,166
It'd be cool if it was true.

395
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,416
Bring it on!

396
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,333
C'mon! Pop up!

397
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,041
Help move everything out too.

398
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,208
Bless you.

399
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,791
I truly hope your wish comes true.

400
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,458
Nammon, you don't have to threaten him.

401
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:33,000
He's not afraid of ghosts.

402
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,666
The only thing he's afraid of is…

403
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,250
Lyn dumping him.

404
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,666
Asshole.

405
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,291
Bossie.

406
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,375
Nammon. Nammon!

407
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,333
Nammon.

408
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,541
Damn…

409
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,458
Shit, what a nightmare!

410
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,291
Oi! Why did you slap me? It hurts!

411
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,541
So you'll know you're awake, boss.
You're safe now.

412
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,875
What the hell?! Why'd you slap me?

413
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,041
I was just checking
if it was really you or not.

414
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,833
- That you're not…
- Burial shroud.

415
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,375
Did you also see it?

416
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,500
Two.

417
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,541
Dammit!

418
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,375
Funny business starting
on the first night…

419
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,333
Damn.

420
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,708
In my dream,
they almost choked me to death.

421
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,833
I don't think it was a dream, boss.

422
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,375
Shit.

423
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,125
Damn it.

424
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,541
Go, will you?

425
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,458
They're calling you.

426
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,375
Yep.

427
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,875
You're like two peas in a pod.

428
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,333
What's with the noise?

429
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,416
I had a nightmare.

430
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,708
- Did you dream of anything?
- Of course.

431
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,333
I dreamt I was at a massage parlor.
The masseuse was about to…

432
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,333
That's enough. I don't need the details.

433
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:43,083
But what's with Nammon and Suakrong?

434
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,208
Why were they hogging my bed all night?

435
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,125
Who's sleeping in my room?

436
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,791
Why don't you take a look yourself?

437
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,708
- Come on.
- What for?

438
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,250
- Come and keep me company.
- Why don't you go yourself?

439
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:03,875
How can I go alone?

440
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:06,875
What the…?

441
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:16,041
The hotel is deserted,
so there's lots of rats.

442
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,375
What the hell are you afraid of?

443
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:22,750
It's cats.

444
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,000
They're looking for rats to eat.

445
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,583
Damn it.

446
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,083
What the hell is going on?

447
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,125
- Is that a ghost?
- Hey!

448
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,666
Everything is mine!

449
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,916
We've got a problem.

450
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,125
I'm going to stay here!

451
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,250
Shit!

452
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,750
She's serving the full package.

453
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,500
What the hell are you reciting?

454
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:58,250
All the other monks are away on business.

455
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,375
I'm a bit confused myself

456
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:04,500
and I'm just wondering

457
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,166
because I've been ordained for only…

458
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,416
One Buddhist Lent, right?

459
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,458
One day.

460
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,375
Up there, please.

461
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,541
Up there too.

462
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,333
Doesn't anyone want to lead?

463
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,458
It'd be a sin to lead a monk.

464
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,416
What's that smell?

465
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:31,791
I'll go.

466
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:33,791
Let's see.

467
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:39,875
Shit.

468
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:45,666
Whoa!

469
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:51,958
Last night, did the noise
come from this room like Jie-Pen told us?

470
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,916
- Are these offerings to ghosts?
- Ghosts?

471
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,958
Please shower this room with holy water.

472
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:08,958
Shit!

473
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:14,125
If you leave,
I'm going to hunt you down at your temple.

474
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,000
Careful. I'm a monk.

475
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,208
Take it easy, okay?

476
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,083
It's been raining heavily lately.
The ceiling hasn't been repaired, I guess.

477
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,125
Don't tell me…

478
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,541
It must be…

479
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,208
It's

480
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,208
blood, right?

481
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,416
That's right.

482
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,083
You answered so confidently.

483
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:08,916
Well then…

484
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,083
Goodbye!

485
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,791
- Sir!
- I can't stay here any longer!

486
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,333
Sir!

487
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,708
- You should've said the ghost was fierce!
- Sir, come back!

488
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,625
Protect your child.

489
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,500
Before I came to work in construction,
I was a monk for 20 Lents.

490
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:31,916
I dare you to come at me!

491
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,416
Bring it on! Come on!

492
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,500
Uncle!

493
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,166
Blood!

494
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:05,958
Shit.

495
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,000
Fuck!

496
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,416
Fuck. Don't touch me!

497
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,791
What the hell?
I'm gonna die because of you.

498
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,416
- Well, I'm terrified.
- You scared me.

499
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,375
Who wouldn't be afraid?

500
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,125
NO ESCAPE

501
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,083
We really can't escape.

502
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,125
Shit.

503
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,583
Wait for me.

504
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:01,333
Open! Open up!

505
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,833
Ghost! A ghost!

506
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:05,958
I know, but can you run away first?

507
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,375
I can't run anywhere.

508
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,583
Why not?

509
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,333
My legs are frozen in place.

510
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,000
Even if they're frozen,
you gotta go. Hurry!

511
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,250
Nakrob!

512
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,541
Nakrob!

513
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,333
Shit, man!

514
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,458
Bruh, wait for me!

515
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:27,625
Boss.

516
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,916
- Go for it, son.
- Yeah. Hurry up.

517
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Let's see.

518
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,375
Hurry! Hurry it up--

519
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,000
Shit.

520
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,541
- You bastard!
- We're all going to die!

521
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,625
JIE-PEN'S KARAOKE BAR

522
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,333
Let me know
if there's anything else you need.

523
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:11,541
Don't be shy.

524
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,333
Look at you.

525
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:23,625
Now do you believe me?

526
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,250
So pitiful.

527
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:46,333
What is it? You can't move again?

528
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,583
Damn it! What's with this song
saying "come"?!

529
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,041
Great. The song's changed.

530
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,208
This is getting tiring.

531
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:19,333
I can relax now.

532
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,500
What's wrong?

533
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,958
The lyrics for this one say
to move in closer.

534
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,458
Shit, she's joining our table!

535
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,458
Shit!

536
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,625
What is it?

537
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,375
Whether you're at the hotel

538
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,166
or anywhere else,

539
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:09,666
if you're not dead,

540
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,250
she's going to follow you wherever you go.

541
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,791
Because your name's on the deed.

542
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,250
You're the hotel's owner now.

543
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,041
None of the previous owners

544
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,000
ever survived.

545
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,083
Mrs. Lalita Phopsuknirun!

546
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,125
I'm Nakrob Prasitchoke.

547
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,416
I'm the owner of this hotel!

548
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,791
I'm here to talk with you nicely.

549
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,500
You can't stay here!

550
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,875
How can you stay here?

551
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:17,708
You're not helping me
pay for the utilities.

552
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,166
You also aren't paying land tax.

553
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:29,916
Quite stubborn, I see.

554
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,083
Fine then.

555
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,625
Just let it be known, Mrs. Lalita…

556
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,708
that I'm putting a bounty on your head.

557
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:42,500
I'm inviting shamans from around the world
to drag you out from here.

558
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,166
Go to a place you like!

559
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,166
- I like it here!
- Shit!

560
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,375
I told you, I'm here to talk nicely.

561
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,500
Please let go.

562
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,041
- Nakrob, I'll help you!
- Guys, help…

563
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,041
- I thought you were gonna catch him.
- Sorry.

564
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,208
True love, bruh.

565
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,041
Let's go. This place isn't ours.

566
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,750
I like the sound of that, boss.

567
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,750
In all the time I've known you,

568
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,000
this is the first time
you've used your brain.

569
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,666
Boss, are you cold?
Your body feels chilly.

570
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,916
Pack up before he changes his mind.

571
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,250
Are you possessed, Nakrob?

572
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,583
You're not putting up a fight?

573
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,041
Do you want to die?

574
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,333
Hey, shithead. I'm helping you.

575
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:56,791
Why not save yourself first?

576
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,166
Is it really you?

577
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,833
Look into my eyes!

578
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,708
You look into my eyes!

579
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,416
Suakrong! Nammon!

580
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,791
Nakrob's possessed by the ghost!

581
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,666
He looks fine.

582
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:26,416
See?! Look now!

583
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,416
Look!

584
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,875
Are you drunk and out of your mind?

585
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,875
Hurry up before Lalita shows up!

586
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:37,708
- Oh my…
- Hurry.

587
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,416
Shit, she's already here choking me!

588
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,250
Cutie.

589
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,250
They're close like childhood friends.

590
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,083
What?

591
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,375
Suakrong, listen to your dad.

592
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,791
Nakrob's possessed by that bitch Lalita!

593
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,750
How can you call her that?

594
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,875
Why not?!

595
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,083
She's a damn ghost.

596
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:15,791
Lalita! A damn ghost!

597
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,916
You're the damned one, you drunkard.

598
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,375
Why the hell did you slap me?
I'm your freakin' dad, you little shit!

599
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:24,916
But I'm not your son!

600
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,708
You dare mock me?

601
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,875
It's the ghost! Damn you!

602
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,500
- Dad!
- Bitch!

603
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,458
Whore! Slut!

604
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Cunt!

605
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,333
Why'd you slap me?

606
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,208
- Suakrong?
- Yes, it's me, Suakrong.

607
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:43,916
You were possessed by Lalita.

608
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,875
I just learned that if a ghost
possesses you, your face will go numb.

609
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,958
Is it really you? Sorry.

610
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,333
Who is she possessing now?

611
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,291
Where is she?

612
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:59,125
I already tried talking to you nicely.

613
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,041
You're not leaving, right?

614
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,041
Nope. You're the one who should leave.

615
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,833
Everything is mine!

616
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,208
I'm going to stay here!

617
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,250
She's just up and left?

618
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,166
I was possessed, wasn't I?

619
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,083
Yeah, but it wasn't too bad.

620
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,000
Bruh!

621
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,250
Let me ask one thing.
Are you gonna leave or not?

622
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,541
You want me
to get thrown out of my own place?

623
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,125
No way! She's the one who's gotta go.

624
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:39,416
I'm begging you.
Please use your brain once more.

625
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,791
We don't want to die here!

626
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,833
I don't want to return to die
in Bangkok either!

627
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:44,916
If I stay here, the ghost might kill me,

628
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,083
but if I return to Bangkok,
Ti will definitely want my head, okay?

629
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,708
Guys, listen to me.

630
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:59,291
No matter what,
I'm going to complete the renovation.

631
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,333
This is my last chance.

632
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,833
TAKUA PA, PHANG NGA

633
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,291
We're here. Hurry up and go in.

634
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:20,708
This is Dr. John.

635
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:29,083
This guy here's done lots of exorcisms
on TV shows from abroad.

636
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,166
Since Thai monks can't handle her,
we'll need to try this instead, boss.

637
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,916
There's a way out of every problem.

638
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,625
What state is he from?

639
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:59,333
An opposite state to us.

640
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:12,250
Put the holy water back.

641
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,125
It didn't work when the monk tried it.

642
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,291
<i>Farang!</i>

643
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:32,208
Damn it. The doctor's possessed.

644
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,208
Possessed?!

645
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,958
- Why'd you kick me?
- Why didn't you turn when I called you?

646
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,291
I'm not hungry. I already ate.

647
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,416
I said not "turn," not "hungry."

648
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,875
My ears aren't good.
I have trouble hearing.

649
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:48,875
I knew it from the first moment I saw him.

650
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,833
- Damn.
- What now?

651
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:01,708
She's here.

652
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,500
I'm gonna kill you.

653
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,583
Hey.

654
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:12,125
If my silver bullets don't scare you,
then come on.

655
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,416
Hey.

656
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:25,166
He shot at the ghost. Why are you hurt?

657
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,208
Tell him to stop shooting. If he doesn't,
Nakrob is as good as dead. Go!

658
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,166
Whoa!

659
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,208
Come on!

660
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,750
What are you waiting for?! Go!

661
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,083
Doctor, stop shooting.

662
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,041
I'm really slingin' it.

663
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,291
Slingin' it like shit.

664
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,750
Doctor, I said stop shooting!

665
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:48,166
- That's really slaying!
- That's not it.

666
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,875
Ouch. Great.

667
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,250
Get up.

668
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,375
No wonder you're half-deaf.

669
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,166
Shit.

670
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:12,833
Behind you.

671
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,666
Behind you.

672
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,583
Oh, "blessings."

673
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,750
He's so lost in the dark.

674
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,500
Yes, definitely blessed.

675
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:25,750
He's definitely a goner.

676
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,416
Oops.

677
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:35,333
Shit.

678
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:49,750
Die, you bitch of a ghost.

679
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,000
Oh my God! Help me!

680
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,750
Run, Nakrob! Hurry up and go!

681
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:08,541
I can't move! My legs are frozen again!

682
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,458
Bruh, don't ditch me.

683
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:12,125
I'm not gonna leave you.

684
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,583
My legs are just like yours.

685
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,541
Take care of yourself, bruh.

686
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:30,333
I'm all warmed up. Lemme speed past you!

687
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:31,625
What a smart aleck!

688
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,125
FLOOR THREE

689
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:36,333
So damn troublesome.

690
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,375
Where are you going?

691
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,708
My goodness, I've been waiting for you.

692
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,750
There!

693
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,250
Whoa, it's just like <i>Chucky</i>.

694
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,875
- All of you listen. Listen!
- Shit!

695
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,666
I said listen!

696
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,791
Close your eyes. She's fooling with us.

697
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:01,458
As soon as we open our eyes,
she'll disappear.

698
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:02,833
Damn it, you bastard!

699
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:04,708
Then how am I gonna see where she's at?

700
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:05,666
Shut up and close them!

701
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:09,583
You, damn ghost!

702
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,166
Don't you dare hurt me!

703
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,625
Nakrob.

704
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,500
Nakrob!

705
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:18,458
Bruh.

706
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,208
What the hell!

707
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,750
You're still alive?

708
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,583
Follow me. I have a way out.

709
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:25,666
Let's go.

710
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,375
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me.

711
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,250
This is the only way.

712
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,625
- What the hell did you eat?
- Hurry it up!

713
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:42,708
- Where'd they go?
- Come on.

714
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,208
Hurry, over here.

715
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:46,958
Doctor, wait for me.

716
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,333
- Keep going.
- He's around the corner.

717
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,791
What is happening

718
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,916
to me?

719
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,833
How could you drag me all the way?
I almost died!

720
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,125
Damn it!

721
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:18,875
How can we escape from up here, Doctor?

722
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,083
Don't worry. There's a way out
of every problem, always.

723
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:26,625
Wait.

724
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,916
How come his hearing's improved?

725
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:37,833
Over there

726
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:39,708
is your way out.

727
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,333
Jump to your death, all of you.

728
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,541
Die! Die! Die!

729
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:54,541
- How are you, bruh?
- I almost twisted my leg.

730
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:56,458
Die! Die! Die!

731
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,541
Damn.

732
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:00,125
Ouch! Now it's twisted.

733
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,250
Die! Die! Die!

734
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:06,500
Now I'm doomed.

735
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,666
Open up. Open!

736
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,166
Come on!

737
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,458
- Can you run?
- No can do.

738
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,416
Where are you going?

739
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:19,166
Going down!

740
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,791
Damn it, what a burden.

741
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,333
Is she still following us?

742
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:31,875
Oh, shit.

743
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,333
Who the heck is this?

744
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,250
Did your dad die or what, Suakrong?

745
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:24,875
I feel bad for that bed over there, boss.

746
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,750
But there's no need to be afraid.

747
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,541
If you die, I'll cry a river for you.

748
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:35,583
You have a lot of time on your hands, huh?

749
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,958
Jie-Pen left this for you.

750
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,333
"Construction company owner
fell from rooftop, dead."

751
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,416
"Locals say that the hotel is cursed."

752
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:11,791
"Big shot entrepreneur hangs himself
from chandelier after hotel flops."

753
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,875
Damn, it's the guy I saw at the hotel.

754
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:19,541
These two names are on the land deed
after Lalita's and Ong-ard's.

755
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,208
That means the next person is…

756
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,583
I've already called
all the shamans in the country.

757
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,500
No one's coming.

758
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:07,958
- The color's nice.
- That's right.

759
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:09,916
Right now pink pastel's in trend.

760
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,458
- There's also green pastel.
- Yes.

761
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:12,791
Looks nice, right?

762
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,250
Right, it really does.

763
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,500
Then I'll take this color.

764
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,083
I have a daughter. She'll like it.

765
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,083
Okay.

766
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,458
I'm here. Did I keep you waiting?

767
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:31,791
"Don't worry, everything's good."

768
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,500
"I'll be done in no time."

769
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:34,708
Smiley face, two hearts.

770
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:35,875
Eww, I wanna puke.

771
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,958
Lyn, can I poke my oar in again?

772
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,375
Is this really your dream?

773
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,291
Yeah, just like this.

774
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,916
Your dream is so damn weird.

775
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,708
You dream of not being
with your boyfriend.

776
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:56,416
Of waiting for him
and not knowing what's he doing.

777
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
If I were you, I'd have gone after him
a long time ago.

778
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:03,708
Geez.

779
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,000
INCOMING THAI CALL

780
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:10,083
<i>Handsome, someone's looking for the hotel.</i>

781
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,458
<i>They said they'll help</i>
<i>drive out the ghost.</i>

782
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:13,750
Drive out the ghost?

783
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,666
They said they're a hermit,

784
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,041
and see that you're having trouble.

785
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,458
<i>Whoa, a hermit? Is he a scammer?</i>

786
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,875
I'm the hermit with a third eye.

787
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,541
You can choose
to either believe me or die.

788
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:36,250
That woman won't stop until she kills you.

789
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:41,958
Hermit.

790
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:43,666
Be my guest.

791
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:45,375
One million!

792
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,291
One million, in exchange for your life.

793
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:52,416
Don't waste time thinking.

794
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:56,458
Come!

795
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,208
Show yourself!

796
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,291
Come on!

797
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,875
My neck's got a crick in it.

798
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,625
Are you gonna come out on your own
or should I drag you--

799
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:41,875
You're really nosy, aren't you?

800
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,916
Everything is mine!

801
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,875
I'm going to stay here!

802
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,291
It's me.

803
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:59,333
She disappears around this time
every night.

804
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:03,875
This is the time when she must return
to the same spot and die.

805
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,375
Let's go.

806
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,000
This is the best time to get rid of her!

807
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:18,541
I call on all the gurus,

808
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,500
teachers, hermits,

809
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,083
Grandma, Grandpa,

810
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,958
Uncle Poon, Uncle Pan,
Aunt Cham, Aunt Choi,

811
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:28,708
Guru Eddie Ed, Guru Peter Pan,
Guru Magic Mike,

812
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,166
Guru Gifty, Guru Jackie Chan,

813
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,416
Guru Danang, Guru Ming, Guru Man,

814
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,666
Guru Gooey Glue, Guru Toom, Guru Pauly,

815
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,916
Guru Hi-hi, Guru Choi, Guru Guppy,
Guru Pup, Guru Pink.

816
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,625
What's with all the gurus?

817
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,000
Why not call on novices too?

818
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,125
There aren't any.
There's only the temple kids.

819
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:47,416
Jook, Kon, Lon, Pia, Dam, Tia,

820
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,416
damn it, you fools!

821
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:50,791
This knife

822
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:54,083
needs to be stabbed into her heart.

823
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,666
Just a small prick

824
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:57,541
and it's game over!

825
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,541
He's the real deal.

826
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,291
Damn it!

827
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:08,208
Master.

828
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:09,333
That's…

829
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,000
He's crashing into everything.

830
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,041
Get it.

831
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,416
- It flew away.
- Huh?

832
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,791
Hurry up and find it.

833
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,375
If you don't, it'll be game over for us.

834
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:39,541
- Why would you swing it around?
- What the hell?

835
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:47,291
Why was he swinging it around?

836
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:48,375
It's so freaking dark.

837
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:59,000
That's it.

838
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,375
Why's the knife smaller?

839
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,041
Hermit.

840
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:10,500
Shit!

841
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,166
That stuff that's dripping
is blood, right?

842
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:46,875
Damn, the knife works.

843
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,833
Stab her! Just stab her!

844
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:52,458
Stab her heart. Stab her!

845
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,083
Two million!

846
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,291
My master died.

847
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:11,791
Hey!

848
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,041
Two million in exchange for your lives.

849
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,208
It isn't even that much.

850
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,291
Damn it. You're putting us in a corner.

851
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:20,333
Do you want to or not?

852
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:23,166
If not, I'll let her break your necks.

853
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,000
Let me break yours first then.

854
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,083
Damn it!

855
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:37,291
Damn ghost!

856
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:40,750
Why not do what other hotel ghosts do?

857
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:44,083
They knock on the doors
and turn on the taps.

858
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,708
At most, they come out to dance.

859
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,708
But what the hell's with you?

860
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,333
You killed people!

861
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:54,458
I hope you go to hell, you damn ghost!
Go straight to hell!

862
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:55,625
You damn ghost!

863
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:58,125
Never be reborn!

864
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,500
- Drag him away!
- I hope you rot in hell!

865
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,625
That's enough.

866
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,333
Just go.

867
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:13,250
Damn it!

868
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,958
I warned you countless times.

869
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:17,416
You're turning burning tables.

870
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,083
You never listen to me.

871
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,625
I know deep down that you bought
this shitty hotel because of Lyn,

872
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:25,208
and never thought of us.

873
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,291
But I tagged along with you

874
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:29,041
because I see you as my brother!

875
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,500
Look at the state we're in!

876
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,000
Bastard!

877
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,541
Jerk! What are you doing?

878
01:03:58,416 --> 01:03:59,333
It really is you.

879
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:02,291
Is this the time and place?
Let's go elsewhere!

880
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,750
No, Uncle.

881
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,583
What happened?

882
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:09,583
Why are you like that?

883
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:14,875
Is this it?

884
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,625
Your promise that you'd succeed?

885
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:21,000
Lyn, can we go talk somewhere else?

886
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,458
I'll tell you everything, Lyn.

887
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:23,541
No!

888
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,458
Not until you tell me
what you're hiding from me.

889
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:30,000
Lyn, please leave. I'm begging you.

890
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,041
I came here because I'm worried about you,

891
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,500
not to listen to your lies.

892
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:36,916
- Lyn!
- What?!

893
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,166
There are ghosts here!

894
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,000
Let's get out of here.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

895
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,125
What do you see me as?

896
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,916
What a flimsy excuse.

897
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:50,583
You really want me to leave, don't you?

898
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:51,666
Fine then.

899
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,833
Lyn, it's not like that.

900
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,833
I'm going to take your lover's life.

901
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,208
And your lousy life too!

902
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:09,125
No way in hell! Let go of my girlfriend!

903
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,208
Nakrob.

904
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,166
Bruh!

905
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,000
- Give my girlfriend back!
- What are you doing?

906
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,291
- Bro, let go!
- Let go of her!

907
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:17,208
- Let go! I said let go!
- No way!

908
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,375
- What's with you?!
- Let go!

909
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:20,833
- Nakrob, bruh! Bruh!
- Let go!

910
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,166
What's wrong with you?!

911
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:30,416
Lyn, there was a ghost.

912
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,791
Lyn, believe me.

913
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,208
There really was a ghost.

914
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:34,916
Lalita!

915
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:38,625
Show yourself! Come on out!

916
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:39,666
That's enough.

917
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,958
Why are you asking for her?
She's a ghost, not some friend.

918
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:43,666
Believe me.

919
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,750
This hotel really has a ghost.

920
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:46,750
Lyn.

921
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:51,916
Believe me, please.

922
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,250
Let's go.

923
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:56,541
- Damn it! Show yourself!
- Enough already.

924
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,083
- You freakin' ghost!
- Why are you cursing it?

925
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:02,125
- Why are you doing this? Come out!
- Just stop.

926
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,041
Let go of me. Come out!

927
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,708
- Come out!
- Hey. Enough!

928
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,750
- Stop!
- I'm telling you, come out!

929
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,375
I'll try to trust you then.

930
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:16,916
Just like I've been doing all along.

931
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:22,166
But I don't really trust myself

932
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,416
to wait for that day to come.

933
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:35,708
I can't imagine what our endgame
will look like.

934
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,458
Well, marriage of course.

935
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Do you think that
I just want to get married?

936
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,625
I want us to grow together.

937
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,333
I want us to stand by each other.

938
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:55,958
But so far, what have I been able to do?

939
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:59,041
I've only been able to wait and wait.

940
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:02,333
I don't even know if you're dead or alive.

941
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:04,916
Everything I've been doing is
for your happiness, Lyn!

942
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,166
Then I think you can do it now.

943
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,791
Just let me leave.

944
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:18,458
Lyn. I'm not gonna let you go.

945
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,625
There's no way
I'm letting you go, understand?

946
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:21,708
- Nakrob, let go.
- Lyn.

947
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:59,416
From now on, it's between me and Lalita.

948
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,791
Whoever's afraid can leave right now.

949
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:06,500
It's your problem

950
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,875
so it's mine as well.

951
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,250
I'm not gonna let you die in vain.

952
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:20,583
Otherwise, I'll have to settle
your debt with Ti.

953
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,541
Even if you have no one else left…

954
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:30,875
Lalita! Here I come!

955
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,666
…you still have me--

956
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:39,458
If I can stab Lalita in the heart,

957
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,750
and she gets reincarnated,

958
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,458
everything will come to an end.

959
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,333
Lalita!

960
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:57,083
You're gonna get it!

961
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:09,541
Have fun trying to break my neck.

962
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:16,958
Is she welcoming us?

963
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,791
What?!

964
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:35,833
Damn.

965
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:42,791
Rats! Damn it!

966
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:48,291
Game on.

967
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,208
Let's go, bruh.

968
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,750
Son of a gun.

969
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,041
You didn't even wait for me.

970
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,625
Dad, let me help you.

971
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,333
Help you be the first to die!

972
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:21,375
What are you doing?

973
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,666
Die! Die! Die!

974
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,125
Shit. What the hell?

975
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,416
What was that?

976
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:46,250
Dad, c'mon. Nakrob and Nammon
have gone on ahead.

977
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,166
Hold on.

978
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,458
- Is it really you?
- Yeah.

979
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,833
What's the code?

980
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:59,250
If Lalita can possess us,
we should be one step ahead of her.

981
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,125
Hey. What are you doing?

982
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:08,666
Here.

983
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,041
If we say these are us,

984
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:15,333
it's impossible to tell who's themselves
and who's possessed.

985
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,541
So, we need a secret code.

986
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,500
That way, we can check who's who.

987
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,708
A code that Lalita won't ever get.

988
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,791
Stop it. That's enough singing.

989
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,583
Hurry up. Get going.

990
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:48,708
Dad, let's go.

991
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:56,916
Uncle Choke, what are you doing?

992
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,250
Why did you come back down?

993
01:11:58,333 --> 01:11:59,666
Because I was worried about you.

994
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,833
Do you think you can trick me again?

995
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:03,833
Ouch!

996
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:05,416
Hold on!

997
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,291
C'mon! It's us, Uncle.

998
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:09,666
This punk is Nakrob, and it's me, Nammon.

999
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,500
I won't believe either of you
without the code.

1000
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:29,583
Pass!

1001
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,333
I…

1002
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:36,250
can't remember.

1003
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,291
"Can't remember"?

1004
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:53,875
Let's go.

1005
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,625
Enough already. Satisfied?

1006
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:07,750
I did both Bird and Nat Myria!

1007
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,125
Just let me pass.

1008
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,250
- That's not it.
- That's not a ghost?

1009
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:15,375
Those aren't the lyrics.

1010
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:17,125
The code?

1011
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,541
You really are showing off your voice.

1012
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:23,916
Hey. The code.

1013
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,500
- Whose song?
- Mine.

1014
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,375
You punk, can't you remember my song?

1015
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,125
Come out and receive your guests!

1016
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:37,500
Why are you staring? What do you want?

1017
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,750
You're intruding on my property!

1018
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:42,708
Why are you being so possessive?
You're dead, aren't you?!

1019
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:44,416
Then die just like me!

1020
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,625
Nakrob, run! You're gonna end up dead.

1021
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,041
I've had enough of running.

1022
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,166
Do you think you're the only trickster?

1023
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,333
How's it feel to be tricked?!

1024
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,750
Boss, you're the man!

1025
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:16,541
It's over, right?

1026
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:28,333
It's not over, Uncle.

1027
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,125
Bruh!

1028
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:50,250
Bruh!

1029
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:54,833
"I'm going to stay here forever with you."

1030
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,333
With you?

1031
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,500
Does that mean her husband is also here?

1032
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:07,916
Don't mess with my property!

1033
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:21,416
Damn.

1034
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:31,083
LALITA, 1994

1035
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:37,291
What's this?

1036
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,291
Lalita wasn't reborn when we stabbed her

1037
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,708
because she gave her heart to Ong-ard.

1038
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,583
Lalita's heart is with Ong-ard.

1039
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:49,791
What a load of crap.

1040
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,083
"I was just like any other woman
who had dreams

1041
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,541
until the day I married you."

1042
01:17:56,625 --> 01:18:00,208
"Not only did I give you the land,
I also gave you my heart."

1043
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:04,208
Lalita wants to stay with her husband.

1044
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:07,875
That means that if we find Ong-ard
and stab him so he's reborn,

1045
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:09,583
Lalita will have to leave as well.

1046
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:11,541
Help me.

1047
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:17,750
Damn.

1048
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:20,833
I found him.

1049
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:42,666
Uncle!

1050
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:46,375
Lalita, let go of my dad!

1051
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,458
Bruh.

1052
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,125
You're going kill the boss. Dad, stop!

1053
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:53,000
You damn ghost! Let go of my dad!

1054
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:54,000
Let go!

1055
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,375
Sorry, Dad.

1056
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,041
Boss! Dad!

1057
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,000
Dad.

1058
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:14,125
Go on and stab him!

1059
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:19,666
If you stab my friend,

1060
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:22,208
Ong-ard, the love of your life…

1061
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,416
is gonna turn into Swiss cheese.

1062
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:40,208
You numb-nuts.

1063
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,791
You have been fooled twice.

1064
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,625
Damn it!

1065
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,875
Will I be reborn?

1066
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,500
Where the hell did they disappear?

1067
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:05,708
She's disappeared at this time again.

1068
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,000
What the hell?

1069
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,125
I've already sold this place.

1070
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:21,291
Or could it be what that hermit told us?

1071
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,666
That she keeps looping at
the time of her death?

1072
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,750
How could you sell it?

1073
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,708
Why didn't you ask me about it?

1074
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,583
Because I knew you wouldn't sell it.

1075
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,875
This is to pay for your land.

1076
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,666
Is your decision

1077
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,041
<i>because this hotel</i>
<i>really can't go on anymore</i>

1078
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,708
or for some other reason?

1079
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:56,916
I have a new dream now
with another person.

1080
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,375
I've returned everything to you now.

1081
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,000
Returned everything?

1082
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,791
I only have you in my life.

1083
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:16,333
- Without you, I have nothing left.
- Lalita.

1084
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:18,083
Take the money and go.

1085
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,583
But my love

1086
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:23,250
and heart that I once gave you,

1087
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:25,541
leave it here!

1088
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,875
Everything is mine!

1089
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:29,833
I'm going to stay here!

1090
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,041
Let go.

1091
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:38,250
Let go!

1092
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,083
Ong-ard.

1093
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:45,958
Don't die.

1094
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,291
We have to stay here together.

1095
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:22,041
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE FOREVER WITH YOU.

1096
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:42,500
Don't!

1097
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:49,291
Let us remain here together, please.

1098
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:53,500
You're such a selfish ghost. You want
to keep killing each other like this?

1099
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:55,833
Do you think he's happy?

1100
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,500
He doesn't want to be with you.

1101
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:13,541
Why force him to remain here?

1102
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:14,583
Just let him go.

1103
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:23,958
Lalita.

1104
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,791
I'm begging you to let me go, please.

1105
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,916
I can't do this anymore.
This is unbearable.

1106
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,250
I don't want to stay here.

1107
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:38,083
I'm begging you, please.

1108
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,833
Let go of me, will you?

1109
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:51,166
Boss, what are you doing?

1110
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:53,333
It's not up to us

1111
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,208
to let go of Ong-ard.

1112
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,250
Bruh.

1113
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,791
With all due respect,

1114
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,583
what the hell is up with you?!

1115
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,416
I helped you even as far as
becoming Swiss cheese!

1116
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,875
The chance to reclaim the hotel
was right in front of you.

1117
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,750
- Don't you have any brain cells left?
- It's like I said.

1118
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,916
It isn't up to us to let him go.

1119
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:34,958
Their love is their business.

1120
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:38,208
You wouldn't be here complaining like this
if they were trying to hurt us again.

1121
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:42,333
The one who's holding on to the other
should let go.

1122
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,000
Are you talking about Lalita and Ong-ard,

1123
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,291
or you and Lyn?

1124
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,416
You don't have to show yourself.

1125
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,208
I'm scared.

1126
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:22,458
Are you sure you're going to stay here?

1127
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:25,833
Are you really happy?

1128
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,291
I understand

1129
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:34,458
that it's hard to let go of
someone you love.

1130
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,916
NAKROB DEVELOPMENT CO., LTD.

1131
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,250
Their happiness is also their right…

1132
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:55,125
and our happiness also belongs to us.

1133
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:02,291
Happiness forever…

1134
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:09,125
It could mean only for ourselves.

1135
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:20,708
I'm going to let go of mine now.

1136
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:23,208
I don't want to be like you.

1137
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,958
But if you want to remain here,
that's fine.

1138
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:34,708
I'll let you stay here for free.

1139
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,208
Aren't I a sugar daddy?

1140
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:02,375
LYN

1141
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:07,250
I'm calling to surrender.

1142
01:27:09,666 --> 01:27:10,875
I really am a loser.

1143
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:15,416
I couldn't achieve our dream.

1144
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:21,583
You don't have to wait anymore.

1145
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:30,916
Thank you very much.

1146
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:47,625
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE FOREVER WITH YOU.

1147
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:54,500
<i>I have many dreams.</i>

1148
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:58,375
But I haven't done a single one of them.

1149
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:00,708
What about you? Do you have any dreams?

1150
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:05,375
I've once dreamt
of having a hotel of my own.

1151
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:07,458
LAND DEED

1152
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:09,291
This is all I have left.

1153
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:11,166
Let's make it a success.

1154
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:16,416
What do you mean, this all you have?

1155
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,625
You have me as well.

1156
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:30,875
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

1157
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:34,083
I love you to pieces.

1158
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:40,333
But I'm really sorry

1159
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:43,083
for loving myself as well.

1160
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,375
I'm the one who has to apologize.

1161
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:49,791
I've been holding you back

1162
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:53,208
and I couldn't make you happy.

1163
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,000
It's fine.

1164
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,708
Someday I'll be happy

1165
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:00,958
and so will you.

1166
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:21,125
<i>Thank you for making my dream come true.</i>

1167
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:23,625
If it weren't for your land,

1168
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:25,791
I'd never be able to own a hotel.

1169
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,583
Is it only your dream alone?

1170
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:29,375
Right now, it's my dream as well.

1171
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:31,791
I'm sorry.

1172
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,958
When will you be checking out, my lady?

1173
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:44,875
I'm not going to check out.
I'll stay here until I'm old.

1174
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:51,750
Would you like to stay together?

1175
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:04,000
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE FOREVER

1176
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:16,291
Are you really not coming with me?

1177
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:21,000
Like I said, I'm not checking out.

1178
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,333
If I do, who'll take care of the hotel?

1179
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:25,666
JIE-PEN'S KARAOKE BAR

1180
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:37,458
That damn Ti. Just forget about him.

1181
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,333
Person. A person!

1182
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:42,458
Shit.

1183
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:44,750
Damn it. Let's go take a look.

1184
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,791
Is that called driving?

1185
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:49,625
- Is this a dog or a person?
- Ouch.

1186
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:51,375
- You again?
- Oh, you.

1187
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:54,541
- Watch where you're going, okay?
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

1188
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,250
You came out of nowhere.

1189
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:58,791
- I hurt all over.
- Are you okay?

1190
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:00,500
It's in the way.

1191
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:02,125
Here, there's still some left.

1192
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:04,166
Ow. I feel sore all over.

1193
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,250
- Sorry, bro.
- Yeah, sorry.

1194
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:07,958
Do you call that driving?

1195
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:10,041
- Let's go, we're gonna be late.
- Yeah. Let's go.

1196
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:13,250
Wait up, wait up.

1197
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:15,416
How can you just leave?

1198
01:32:16,083 --> 01:32:17,208
Come over here.

1199
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:18,500
Please buy some lotto tickets.

1200
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:20,416
My wallet's all dried up.

1201
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,791
This is the last one left.

1202
01:32:23,458 --> 01:32:24,416
Fine.

1203
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,416
Does it not hurt anymore?

1204
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,416
Look at him.

1205
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,875
Don't ask if you know.

1206
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:41,791
<i>The winning jackpot lottery numbers</i>

1207
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:46,916
<i>for the 16th of June 2025.</i>

1208
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,291

<i>4, 0, 4.</i>

<i>- Once more.</i>

1212
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:57,916
<i>The winning jackpot numbers…</i>

1213
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,750
- I think it's it.
- What's it?

1214
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,291
<i>…for the 16th of June 2025…</i>

1215
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:04,583
This is it, right?

1216
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:06,500
The pretty woman there
already bought the rest.

1217
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:07,541
This is the last one.

1218
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:08,791
Pretty woman?

1219
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:15,875
<i>The winning number is 1, 4, 1, 4, 0, 4.</i>

Damn it, we won the jackpot! The jackpot!

1221
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:23,291
We won the jackpot!

1222
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:27,541
Hey.
Watch the road! Hey!

1223
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:33,833
SUKHEE NIRUN HOTEL

1224
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:48,750
Welcome, all ghosts,
to the Sukhee Nirun Hotel.

1225
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:50,916
How many nights?

1226
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:55,416
How many nights are you gonna stay?

1227
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:56,458
Gun?

1228
01:33:56,958 --> 01:33:59,208
There aren't any bullets.

1229
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,375
How many nights will you be staying?

1230
01:34:01,458 --> 01:34:04,333
Standing? I'm standing right here.

1231
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,916
Don't mess with me.

1232
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:15,583
I'm still mad at you. Get away from me.

1233
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:19,541
If I had a knife, I'd stab you for sure.

1234
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:20,708
Where are you?

1235
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:23,041
Sorry.

1236
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,250
You stabbed me and now you feel guilty?

1237
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:27,583
Miss.

1238
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,125
Look, a client is here.

1239
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:35,041
Well, well.
What kinda ghost dresses like that?

1240
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:39,416
<i>Chào chị.</i>

1241
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:42,750
<i>"Chào chị."</i>

1242
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:45,875
Oh, a Vietnamese ghost. International.

1243
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:50,875
I heard this hotel has rooms
for ghosts, right?

1244
01:34:51,625 --> 01:34:53,833
That's right. Welcome.

1245
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,750
Who wants some gongs?

1246
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:04,916
Living humans? Didn't you say
this hotel only has ghosts?

1247
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,125
No feet?

1248
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:11,250
That's why ghosts never leave tracks.

1249
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:18,041
The both of us have traveled
a long way to visit Thailand.

1250
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:19,583
They're Indonesian ghosts.

1251
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:22,166
Do you have a room available?

1252
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:26,750
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1253
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,041
What? Casino?

1254
01:35:32,208 --> 01:35:34,333
What are you looking at?
Here comes another couple.

1255
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:37,208
Double trouble.

1256
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,500
How come they came together?

1257
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:49,458
Over here, there's more.

1258
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,458
Welcome to the Sukhee Nirun Hotel.

1259
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,458
You, come here.

1260
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:15,208
You can't ditch me like this!

1261
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:17,000
What did you tell me when I called you?

1262
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:18,000
You ass!

1263
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:19,958
If you were a male ghost,
I'd kick you in the balls.

1264
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:21,958
If you were a woman's ghost,
I'd make you my wife.

1265
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:24,208
You're the foreman
so take responsibility for this!

1266
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:25,375
I'm not the foreman, sir.

1267
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:26,708
Huh? Then who are you?

1268
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:29,041
I live around here. I heard the commotion
and came to check things out.

1269
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:30,458
Who are you?! Hurry up!

1270
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:32,625
You can't leave me like this! Come back!

1271
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:34,333
What about my work?!

1272
01:36:35,375 --> 01:36:36,875
- I'm leaving.
- I don't wanna know!

1273
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,291
Go wherever you want!

1274
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:40,291
They said they saw a ghost.

1275
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:42,875
So they all ran away.

1276
01:36:47,083 --> 01:36:48,833
Didn't you leave with them?

1277
01:36:48,916 --> 01:36:50,250
I live around here.

1278
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:53,250
Why the hell are you back here?

1279
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:56,166
- Can I hitch a ride with you?
- Who are you?

1280
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:57,250
I'm Art.

1281
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,041
Art? What Art?

1282
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,041
Some Art around here.

1283
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,416
Like I would know?

1284
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,666
Stop pressing me.

1285
01:37:09,458 --> 01:37:11,541
- Did he know about this?
- Where did that come from?

1286
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:13,208
Buddhist amulet?

1287
01:37:15,916 --> 01:37:17,125
Fashion statement.

1288
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:18,958
What's that clipped to your shirt?

1289
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,541
A talisman.

1290
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:22,291
And down there? A phallus talisman?

1291
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,625
- No.
- Then…?

1292
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:26,875
It's my family jewels.

1293
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:27,833
Cut.

1294
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,041
You're playing with the family jewels.

1295
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:32,333
I like that. Let's continue.

1296
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:39,083
There's a way out of every problem.

1297
01:37:39,166 --> 01:37:40,541
What state is he from?

1298
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:42,833
Probably from LA, looking for hot chicks.

1299
01:37:42,916 --> 01:37:44,333
More like looking for hotpot.

1300
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:48,000
What state is he from?

1301
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:50,666
From Hawaii. I heard him scream
like they shout there.

1302
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:52,083
Maybe he was bitten by snakes.

1303
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:53,416
He's here to drive out the ghost.

1304
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,083
They ad-libbed.

1305
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:56,166
What state is he from?

1306
01:37:57,333 --> 01:37:58,875
An opposite state to us.

1307
01:37:58,958 --> 01:38:00,875
Looks like he just fought
against the count.

1308
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:01,916
Count Dracula?

1309
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,625
Count on it, I'm a cutie.

1310
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:04,625
Cut.

1311
01:38:10,541 --> 01:38:14,208
How could you drag me up here?
I almost died!

1312
01:38:20,416 --> 01:38:22,458
How can we esgrace from up here, Doctor?

1313
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:25,208
Huh? What did you say?

1314
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:26,708
"Esgrace"? Escape!

1315
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:29,583
Escape. Escaped. Escaping.

1316
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:31,583
- Escape. Escaped. Escaping.
- Escaped. Escaping.

1317
01:38:31,666 --> 01:38:32,541
Make it good now. Hurry.

1318
01:38:32,625 --> 01:38:33,833
Hold on.

1319
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:37,166
- Is it really you?
- Yeah.

1320
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:38,958
Code!

1321
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:47,416
I'm fake.

1322
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:48,666
Damn you!

1323
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,708
You jerk!

1324
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:52,416
Hold on.

1325
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,083
Is it really you?

1326
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:56,833
Yeah.

1327
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,416
Code!

1328
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:05,125
Fake again! Damn you!

1329
01:39:06,083 --> 01:39:07,916
Let me retry, Dad.

1330
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,166
Hold on!

1331
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:10,791
Is it really you?

1332
01:39:11,416 --> 01:39:12,375
Yeah!

1333
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:13,291
Code!

1334
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:29,416
Stop it! That's enough.

1335
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:31,625
You really know how to make things up.

1336
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,166
Sure. It's good.

1337
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,416
Is it really you?

1338
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:40,541
Jackass.

1339
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:43,541
Here, here.

1340
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:44,458
Master.

1341
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:56,291
Who's turn? It's so quiet.

1342
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:57,541
- What?
- Whose dialogue?

1343
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,791
- It's you.
- It's your part.

1344
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:00,750
What the hell?

1345
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:03,000
- "I call on all…"
- Oh, right.

1346
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:04,875
Summon the gurus.

1347
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:07,416
Damn it. Why's he asking whose turn it is?

1348
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,583
- Hand him the knife again.
- To all my teachers and gurus.

1349
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:12,125
Come gather here at this place.

1350
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:14,041
I was shocked because of the knife.

1351
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:16,958
You young-looking guy!

1352
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:19,000
You dare look down on me?!

1353
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:22,708
Do you know how many ghosts
have been ended with this knife?

1354
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:25,125
Hungry ghosts, forest ghosts,
snake ghosts, granny ghosts--

1355
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:29,125
Enough already.
You're starting to repeat yourself.

1356
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:35,416
If this knife
is stabbed through her heart,

1357
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,875
it's game over!

1358
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:40,291
Turn off your headlamp.

1359
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:43,750
What?

1360
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,791
Too rowdy to hold it.

1361
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:55,333
That's too funny.

1362
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,916
He quickly apologized to me.
