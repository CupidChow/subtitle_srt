1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,340
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,320
(Episode 90)

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,090
Sorry?

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,230
Yu Jin.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,670
Yu Jin.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,600
My daughter.

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,410
Who?

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,850
It's me, Mommy. Yu Jin.

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,320
Don't you know who I am?

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,230
My daughter, Yu Jin.

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,330
No, I'm Goo Ha Na. I'm not Yu Jin.

14
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,500
What's wrong?

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,070
She doesn't recognize me.

16
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,610
Ms. Chairwoman, it's me, Ms. Jang.

17
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,650
Do you recognize me?

18
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,380
"Ms. Jang?"

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,630
We'll run a CT scan and MRI on her.

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,160
Okay.

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,470
Is she confused
because she hasn't been up for long?

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,980
Hello?
She regained her consciousness?

23
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,590
How's her condition?

24
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,790
I'll be there with Eun Chong.

25
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,800
Has Ms. Shin woken up?

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,800
- Yes, let's find Eun Chong first.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,440
Do we have to hope
Aunt Yeo Jin never wakes up?

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,940
Of course.
If she does, it'll be the end of us.

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,580
Why would it be the end of us
if Aunt Yeo Jin woke up?

30
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,150
What did you mean by that?

31
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,780
Are you saying my mom did that...

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,450
Yes. Your mom is the key suspect...

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,250
for attempted murder.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
It feels too unsettling...

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,860
to ignore Ha Na's words.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,200
Let's go, Eun Chong.

37
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,840
Se Young!

38
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,180
Mr. Hwang.

39
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,850
Hey, Eun Chong.

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,750
Why are you here?

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,560
- Were you looking for me?
- We need to talk.

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,190
I have nothing to hear from you.

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,990
Hear me out before you go.

44
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,110
What will you do
after taking him abroad?

45
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,280
Aunt Yeo Jin wanted him
to go study abroad.

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,110
She woke up, so go ask her.

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,780
If you take him out of the country,

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,420
you'll be your mother's accomplice.

49
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,120
"Accomplice?"

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,690
There are many suspicions on her,

51
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,960
including the chairwoman's coma
and the respirator coming off.

52
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,460
Are you saying
my mom did both of those?

53
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,730
I'm not saying that.

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,100
But there are
suspicious circumstances.

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,570
Stop lying.

56
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,570
You're slandering my mom
to stop me from leaving.

57
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,440
Why would I lie about this to you?

58
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,410
Let's go, Eun Chong.

59
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
If you want to go, go alone.

60
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm taking him with me.

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,180
Move aside.

62
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,120
My mom is his legal guardian.

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Mr. Yoon left the detention center,

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,390
and the chairwoman
regained consciousness.

65
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,430
Do you think you'll be at peace
after leaving like this?

66
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,660
Your mother isn't leaving,
so why should you?

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,300
Eun Chong.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
Grandpa!

69
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,440
Eun Chong.

70
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,340
Thank you, Eun Chong.

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,410
Thank you, Eun Chong.

72
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,850
Grandpa, did you leave
the police station?

73
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,960
Yes, and Grandma woke up.

74
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,860
Let's go see her.

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,530
- Really?
- Yes.

76
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,930
Darn it.

77
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,540
Yeo Jin will remember everything
when she wakes up.

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,980
What if she tells everything
to the police?

79
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,550
My gosh.

80
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,490
Hello?

81
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,090
How's Yeo Jin's condition?
Is she all right?

82
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,700
She's getting examined right now.
We'll have to wait for the result.

83
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,070
This is too frustrating.

84
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,010
I need to see her myself.

85
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,290
Yeo...

86
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,160
Yeo Jin, are you really up?

87
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,030
I ran over frantically
as soon as the hospital called.

88
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,240
This is a miracle, Yeo Jin.

89
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,640
Yeo Jin...

90
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,920
Actually, I...

91
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,320
Who are you?

92
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,230
Yeo Jin.

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,030
It's me, Se Young's mom.

94
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,970
The closest person to you,
your sister-in-law.

95
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,170
"Sister-in-law?"

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,110
Does she not recognize me?

97
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,050
- What's your name?
- Choi Myung Ji.

98
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,350
Choi Myung...

99
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,090
Why does she not recognize me?

100
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,760
Why not?

101
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,740
She glared at me.
Is she feigning ignorance?

102
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,350
You aren't on the plane yet?

103
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,620
You lost Eun Chong?

104
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,020
Uncle Sung Ho and Jin Goo came
and then took him away.

105
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,730
- How did they know?
- I don't know.

106
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,200
Even so,
how can you let them take him?

107
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
We'll talk at home.

108
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,580
Nothing is going the right way.

109
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,890
I don't have to be scared already.

110
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,790
I need to know
what her condition is...

111
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,930
to come up with a measure
or decide to run away.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,740
It's me, Yeo Jin.

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,440
Do you recognize me?

114
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,680
Who are you?

115
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,110
Your husband, Yoon Sung Ho.

116
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,250
Don't you remember?

117
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,630
She doesn't even recognize
her husband?

118
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,790
Grandma.

119
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,430
He's Yu Jin's son.

120
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,500
Yu Jin's son?

121
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,940
Yu Jin was here just now.

122
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,570
Yu Jin was here?

123
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,740
Is she seeing things?

124
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,210
Wait, does she have dementia?

125
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,580
She thought Ms. Goo was
her daughter.

126
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,720
Ha Na?

127
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,950
What kind of nonsense is this?

128
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,350
Are her memories not intact?

129
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,530
The result said she had amnesia
caused by injury.

130
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,860
"Amnesia?"

131
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,170
Fate is on my side.

132
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,940
I hope her memories never return.

133
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,910
Where's Yu Jin?

134
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,240
She was here just now.

135
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,510
- Yu Jin.
- No, honey.

136
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,680
You can't move around like this.

137
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,850
Ms. Chairwoman.

138
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,320
She doesn't remember
anything else...

139
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,060
other than Yu Jin.

140
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,140
Yu Jin.

141
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,710
My daughter.

142
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,170
Who?

143
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,440
It's me, Mommy. Yu Jin.

144
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,980
Why did she call me Yu Jin?

145
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,050
Hello, Jin Goo?

146
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,760
I heard you visited the chairwoman.

147
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,660
Yes, she didn't seem to remember me.

148
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,960
Is the result out?

149
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,800
She's suffering from amnesia.

150
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,370
She thought you were
her daughter, right?

151
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,400
Yes. If she has amnesia,

152
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,240
is she unable to remember anything?

153
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,210
For now, yes.

154
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,680
So, we don't even know
if and when she'll remember.

155
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,810
That's correct.

156
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,980
Why did you ask me
if Eun Chong had reached out?

157
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,720
Is something going on?

158
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,090
Choi Myung Ji tried to send him
to study abroad in the UK.

159
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,860
What? The UK?

160
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,160
I went to the airport
and brought him back.

161
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,700
It would've been the worst
if he had gotten on the flight.

162
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,200
He's such a young boy.

163
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,400
And she told me to come over
and see him on the weekend.

164
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,270
Where is he right now?

165
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,140
He's at my place, so don't worry.

166
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
I'll be there now.

167
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,980
If she has spent her life
looking for her lost daughter,

168
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
she won't listen to anyone...

169
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,160
now that she thinks
her daughter has returned.

170
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,560
Then, what should I do?

171
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,430
She's emotionally unstable
at the moment,

172
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,560
so don't try too hard
to tell her the truth.

173
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,370
It's better to accept
what she's feeling.

174
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,470
Would it help her to recover
if that person was by her side?

175
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,710
Of course.

176
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,440
- I should ask Ms. Goo for a favor.
- Yes.

177
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,750
That brat can't help Yeo Jin
find her memories.

178
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,150
Why did she think of Ha Na
as Yu Jin?

179
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,320
It should've been Se Young.

180
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,530
Your grandma woke up,
and your grandpa was released.

181
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,300
Lots of great things
happened for you.

182
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,770
Yes. I almost got on a plane today.

183
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,930
Really? Where were you going?

184
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,440
It must be Auntie Ha Na.

185
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,980
Hello.

186
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,610
Eun Chong.

187
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,110
Auntie Ha Na.

188
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,620
I heard you were at the airport.

189
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Why didn't you tell me?

190
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,390
She told me not to tell you
about going on a trip.

191
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,590
- She said it was a trip?
- Yes.

192
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
You still need to be honest with me.

193
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,160
What if you got on that flight?

194
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,800
It makes me shudder
just to imagine that.

195
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,610
Why did Myung Ji
try to sneak him out?

196
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,640
She's so sly.

197
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,110
- You don't hate me, do you?
- What?

198
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,520
Why would I hate you?

199
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,250
Who said she hated you?

200
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,620
One second.

201
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,360
Yes, Mr. Yoon?

202
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,460
Right now?

203
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,700
You want me to act like Yu Jin?

204
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,670
I know it's brazen of me to ask.

205
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,840
The doctor says...

206
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,040
she believes
her daughter has returned.

207
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,650
If you stay with her
and talk to her as Yu Jin,

208
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,280
it may help her remember everything.

209
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,320
Mr. Yoon,
I don't think this is possible.

210
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can do that for you.

211
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,530
I never got a proper apology...

212
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,090
after she used me
as a fake daughter,

213
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,330
yet you wanted to ask me
to be that once again?

214
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,570
- This is harsh.
- Yes.

215
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,300
I knew it was harsh,

216
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,010
but this was all I could do.

217
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,270
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,950
Excuse me.

219
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,620
I can't help you with this.

220
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,260
What she said was right.

221
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,140
If Chairwoman Shin has amnesia,

222
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,180
it must've been a nice break
for Choi Myung Ji.

223
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,810
Do you think she really did that
to Chairwoman Shin?

224
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,850
If she had given up leaving Korea
and returned,

225
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,750
there would be a reason why
Chairwoman Shin shouldn't wake up.

226
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,020
What about Se Young?

227
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,190
Choi Myung Ji was gone
by the time we got there.

228
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,320
She was there alone with Eun Chong.

229
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,690
How did she look?

230
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,600
She looked like a lost child
abandoned all alone...

231
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,730
without her mom and Eun Chong.

232
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,480
You must've heard
I was stopped at the airport.

233
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,080
Have some tea first.

234
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,520
What is it?
Why are you beating around the bush?

235
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,190
Isn't it much better
that you couldn't run away?

236
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,060
You would've been so bored overseas,
alone with Eun Chong.

237
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,870
"Run away?"
I was leaving to study abroad.

238
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,670
I told you that
I'd be away for about a year.

239
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,170
Also, I want to raise...

240
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,510
Eun Chong properly
as Hyesung's successor.

241
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,940
That's what your mom wants.

242
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,310
What she wants is what I want.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,580
Since when?

244
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,150
Since when I was born.

245
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
Do you enjoy living your life
according to her will?

246
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,620
Are you happy?

247
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,020
"Am I happy?" Don't be so tacky.

248
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,930
If I don't live this life,
will I be guaranteed happiness?

249
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,130
What if it does?

250
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,830
Do you want to live
a different life?

251
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,930
What is this?

252
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,840
Did you suddenly call me here
to propose?

253
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,970
That's not it.

254
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,670
It was time you stopped.

255
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,280
You should live as Se Young,
not Choi Myung Ji's daughter.

256
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,240
How long will you live
under her control?

257
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,910
Why are you all going after my mom?

258
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,280
- Who else?
- Ha Na and Jin Goo.

259
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,590
Why do you care about how I live?

260
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,520
It's not like
all of you live a great life.

261
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,460
Don't trust her too much.

262
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,360
She's my mom.

263
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,500
You aren't my boyfriend,
husband, or family.

264
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,030
You're awful.

265
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,380
Will she regain her memories
if these two stay together?

266
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,990
She may have forgotten in her head,
but her heart still remembers.

267
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,830
I just need to know
if she'll remember or not.

268
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,300
Everything has begun already.

269
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,810
It has begun?

270
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,480
So, she's in the process
of remembering?

271
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,710
Everything will come to light
very soon.

272
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,050
No! It can't!

273
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,620
Please stop it.

274
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,590
Don't trust her too much.

275
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,000
Your mom is the key suspect...

276
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,860
for attempted murder.

277
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,630
If you take him out of the country,

278
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,130
you'll be your mother's accomplice.

279
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,300
- "Accomplice?"
- There are many suspicions on her,

280
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,910
including the chairwoman's coma
and the respirator coming off.

281
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,440
Are you saying
my mom did both of those?

282
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,940
I'm not saying that.

283
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,510
But there are
suspicious circumstances.

284
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,680
Why is everyone
suspicious of my mom?

285
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,490
Do they have evidence?

286
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,730
I need to siphon off her assets
before her memories return.

287
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,030
I'll meet with the CEO
of the trust company tomorrow...

288
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,970
and bug her hospital room.

289
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,900
How's Aunt Yeo Jin?

290
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,040
She doesn't recognize me.

291
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,940
What do you mean?

292
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,810
She has amnesia.

293
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,450
What? Amnesia?

294
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,220
Isn't that a stroke of good luck?

295
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,060
Her memories can return any day,
maybe even tomorrow.

296
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,760
I can't be rest assured.

297
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,130
Why are you so anxious?

298
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,290
I'm afraid...

299
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,800
she'll find out I tried to take
Eun Chong's trust fund.

300
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,430
And you can't frame her...

301
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,240
for your embezzlement
if she remembers.

302
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,240
I can't let that happen.

303
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,110
Was that why
she put my aunt off the respirator?

304
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,650
Wait, did she also
put her in the coma?

305
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,480
She doesn't recognize anyone,

306
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,590
but she remembers Yu Jin's name.

307
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Wait, does this mean
she's slowly remembering everything?

308
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,090
Perhaps.

309
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,730
Do you know what's worse?

310
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,630
She thinks Ha Na is Yu Jin.

311
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,500
- Ha Na?
- On top of that, Sung Ho...

312
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,970
will ask her to act like Yu Jin.

313
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,970
- You need to stop him.
- He doesn't listen.

314
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,580
She wouldn't act...

315
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,880
as a fake daughter again
if she was in her right mind.

316
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,920
They must've met by now.

317
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,860
Hey, Ms. Jang.

318
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,930
Sung Ho met with Ha Na, right?

319
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,230
She turned him down?

320
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,000
Gosh, why wouldn't she do it?

321
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,900
Goodness.

322
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,010
Then, I'll come by often...

323
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,810
and do my best to help her remember.

324
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,740
Yes. Goodbye.

325
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,750
- Did Ha Na refuse?
- Of course, she should.

326
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,630
Are you concerned?

327
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,100
I'll ignore it.

328
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,000
It's awful to imagine
acting like her daughter...

329
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,700
when I think of everything
she has done to me.

330
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,210
I'm getting angry, too.

331
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,310
I know he thinks very dearly
of the chairwoman,

332
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,480
but I won't condone it
if he tries to hurt you.

333
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,750
Then what?

334
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,480
What do you want me to do?

335
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
Your wish is my command.

336
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,220
I'm happy enough to hear
you're on my side.

337
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,990
It's really nice
to have someone's support.

338
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,790
I feel like I'm getting protected.

339
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm your guardian.

340
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,000
Wait, I need to seal this for good.

341
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,300
Should we
register our marriage first?

342
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,440
This isn't how you should propose.

343
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,010
Did it sound like a proposal?

344
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,450
You want me to propose to you.

345
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,350
No way.

346
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,450
How do you want me
to do the proposal?

347
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,090
I'll do that.

348
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,030
- There are quite a few things.
- How many?

349
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,700
Will you do everything for me?

350
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,760
Let me hear you out first.

351
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,510
You had your food,
so take your medicine.

352
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,450
Why isn't Yu Jin here? I miss her.

353
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,920
Honey.

354
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,590
Please bring Yu Jin here.

355
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,830
Yu Jin.

356
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,270
- You're here, Eun Chong.
- Hello.

357
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,900
Why isn't Yu Jin coming?

358
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,610
She only wants Yu Jin.

359
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,280
Grandma, do you still
not remember me?

360
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,720
He's Yu Jin's son. Our grandson.

361
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,650
"Yu Jin's son?"

362
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,790
Why isn't your mommy with you?

363
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,490
Where is she right now?

364
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,030
- My mommy is in paradise...
- She's looking for Auntie Ha Na.

365
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,770
Auntie Ha Na is home.

366
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,070
I miss Yu Jin.

367
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,220
Eun Chong, what's that?

368
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,590
A letter I wrote to Auntie Ha Na.

369
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,730
"A letter?"

370
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,170
Is she not coming
because my grandma did...

371
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,640
something wrong to her family?

372
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,810
Your grandma did something wrong?

373
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,510
I wrote a letter of apology
to Auntie Ha Na.

374
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,940
Can you take me to see her?

375
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,480
Do you want to give it to her?

376
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,250
Is this a letter you wrote?

377
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,890
I'm sorry, Auntie Ha Na.

378
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,960
Please forgive everything
my grandma and grandpa did wrong...

379
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,260
to your family.

380
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,640
Eun Chong,
why did you write this letter?

381
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
What did Little Grandma tell you?

382
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,710
That my grandma did
something really wrong...

383
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,110
to your mommy and daddy.

384
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,980
Choi Myung Ji, that woman.

385
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,650
She shouldn't have said that
to a child.

386
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,120
The chairwoman apologized
for what she did wrong.

387
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,860
- She did?
- Yes.

388
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,790
And even if she does wrong,

389
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,430
I won't hate you or dislike you.

390
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,330
But Auntie Ji Eun
and Uncle Ji Chang hate me.

391
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,440
They told me
not to come to his snack bar.

392
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,810
That's because
they don't know the whole story.

393
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,080
So, the reason
you didn't come to the hospital...

394
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,880
wasn't because
you were mad at her, right?

395
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,890
- No.
- Then, can you go and see her?

396
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,390
She wants to see you.

397
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,460
That's...

398
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,770
You're the only one
she wants to see.

399
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,500
She can't remember me, my grandpa,

400
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,440
or Kongkong.

401
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,880
Then, it's just this once.

402
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,110
Okay.

403
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,790
- Hurry up and do it, Mom.
- I'm doing it.

404
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,030
She's coming.

405
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,100
- Yeo Jin.
- Aunt Yeo Jin.

406
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,400
We're here.

407
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,440
Where has she been?

408
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,010
To get examined.

409
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,280
I brought
your favorite flowers, Aunt Yeo Jin.

410
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,220
And your favorite tea, rooibos.

411
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,580
Yeo Jin, you should have some.

412
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,290
I thought I should show you...

413
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,920
many things you liked
to get your memories back.

414
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,390
Have some, Yeo Jin.

415
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,300
What's wrong? What is it?

416
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,170
Wait, does she remember?

417
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,040
Mom.

418
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,540
What's wrong, Yeo Jin?

419
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,380
Why isn't Yu Jin here?

420
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,180
She's talking about Ha Na, right?

421
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,450
Did you really forget?

422
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,420
Or are you feigning ignorance,
although you remember?

423
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,060
Yu Jin.

424
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,030
Yu Jin.

425
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,260
What took you so long?

426
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,170
Don't go anywhere.

427
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,440
I looked everywhere for you.

428
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,620
Ha Na must be
really into this shampoo, too.

429
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,730
It's so nice whenever I use it.

430
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,130
It's definitely
making my hair softer.

431
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
I've used this shampoo, too.

432
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,880
It's giving my hair so much volume
as if I have a lot of hair.

433
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,980
Right?

434
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,710
Don't you see lots of volume here?

435
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,510
I don't have to go
to a hair salon anymore.

436
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,590
I won't have to worry
about losing too much hair, either.

437
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,560
Anyway, isn't it a blessing
for Chairwoman Shin...

438
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,560
to forget everything?

439
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,930
Listen to this kid.

440
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,730
I mean, she did lots of bad things,

441
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,760
so she could use this
as a chance to forget everything.

442
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,170
Hey, maybe she's pretending
to have lost her memories.

443
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,600
You're right.

444
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,910
She's more than capable
of doing that.

445
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,710
I just need to share a few words...

446
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,980
to figure out if this is real
or if she's acting.

447
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,240
Forget it.

448
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,110
You were deceived like a fool
about how Ha Na was her daughter.

449
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,720
That was back then.
I'm a different man now.

450
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,220
Grandma, my mommy looks like this.

451
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,430
Yeo Jin, do you remember Yu Jin?

452
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,600
My poor girl.

453
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,540
She must remember.

454
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,880
My poor baby.

455
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,620
Grandma, do you
still not remember Kongkong?

456
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,630
"Kongkong?"

457
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,200
Auntie Ha Na and my mommy...

458
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,530
made this plushie for me.

459
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,240
Yu Jin.

460
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,040
Will you just hold her hand?

461
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,320
I've longed...

462
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,790
to hold your hand for so long.

463
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,970
Your scent.

464
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,570
Your warmth.

465
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,770
I remember everything.

466
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,540
I can't deal with this anymore.

467
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,580
It doesn't look like
they've staged this.

468
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,630
She thinks Ha Na is actually Yu Jin.

469
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,760
What if she really becomes Yu Jin
and not just her fake daughter?

470
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,530
I'll split them up.

471
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,430
Anyway, are you sure
she doesn't remember?

472
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,370
Why did she throw that tea at you
while giving you the death glare?

473
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,810
I have no idea.

474
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,580
Does she detest me on instinct?

475
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,440
You should go home.

476
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,280
- What about you?
- I have to stick around.

477
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,050
And I want to test out the bug.

478
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,860
Hey, Eun Chong. Where are you going?

479
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,190
Grandpa and I are going to a cafe.

480
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,840
I looked everywhere for you.

481
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,710
Don't go anywhere else,
and just stay by my side.

482
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
You're confusing me for Yu Jin...

483
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,180
because you really
don't remember, right?

484
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,980
Do you not remember anything
about your fall?

485
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,990
My fall?

486
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,960
You collapsed at home,
lost consciousness,

487
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,430
and were brought to the hospital.

488
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,560
Choi Myung Ji was there with you.

489
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,030
Do you not remember anything?

490
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,300
I collapsed at home?

491
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,640
Choi Myung Ji...

492
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,940
The notebook.

493
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,610
"The notebook?"

494
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,280
What notebook?

495
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,450
That evil brat.

496
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,630
"That evil brat?"

497
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,170
Who?

498
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,400
(Cinderella Game)

499
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,430
You'll make Chairwoman Shin remember
to disclose Choi Myung Ji's crimes?

500
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,100
The notebook must be
an important lead.

501
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,540
It's probably not at home.

502
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,200
She would've left it
in a personal safe.

503
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,140
Do you not remember
what was in the notebook?

504
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,870
I want to talk to Yu Jin.

505
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,410
She may not remember in her head,

506
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,740
but her feelings do.

507
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,050
I'm here,
so it'll be better if you stay away.

508
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,420
- What do you mean by Pandora's box?
- Are you curious?

509
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,850
And find out
what else your mother is hiding.

510
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,590
- Eun Chong.
- Do you really remember him?
