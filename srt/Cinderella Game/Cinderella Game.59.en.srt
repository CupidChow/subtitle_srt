1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,710
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,169
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,209
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:08,849
Hey. Okay. All right.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,449
Eun Chong, my dear.

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,419
Oh, my dear.

7
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,789
You're so cute. Why are you so cute?

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,160
Eun Chong, look over here.

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,260
Look over here.

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,530
Eun Chong.

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,699
One, two.

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,399
Mom.

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,670
Peek-a-boo. Where do you want to go?

14
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,640
Here? Where? Let's see.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,810
Where?

16
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,340
Which one?

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,509
Mom, why are you watching this
instead of sleeping?

18
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,579
Peek-a-boo.

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,420
Are you crying?

20
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,890
Hey.

21
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,390
Eun Chong must've left this
on the sofa...

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,159
after watching his mom's video.

23
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,560
I was unconsciously brought to tears
after watching this.

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,700
Why are you out here?

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,370
I just woke up.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,109
Were you in my room just now?

27
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,280
No.

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,450
By any chance,
do you know Eun Chong's mom?

29
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,420
Have you met her before?

30
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:25,790
How would I know her?

31
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,560
Everything I knew was
what I heard from you.

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,629
Why do you ask?

33
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:37,769
You seem to care a lot
about Du Na and Eun Chong.

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,439
She's your friend,
so she doesn't feel like a stranger.

35
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,010
Keep this well.
Eun Chong may want it later.

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,549
Okay.

37
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,719
I'll go back to my room.

38
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:13,370
She saw me crying,
so she might get suspicious.

39
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,009
I was also disappointed
and troubled...

40
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,250
when Eun Chong disappeared...

41
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,449
and the home visit was
canceled twice.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,620
But why do you never ask
about how I feel?

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,340
Why did she cry while looking at Du Na
and Eun Chong's video?

44
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,939
This wasn't the first time
she watched it.

45
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,740
It's so weird.

46
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,849
Yu Jin.

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,250
Yes, Mom?

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,919
Can we talk for a moment?

49
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,449
I haven't shown
enough concern for you.

50
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,719
You must've been hurt and sad.
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,199
I probably got ahead of myself...

52
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,560
even though I wasn't ready.

53
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,729
I'm still like this
even after waiting for 20 years.

54
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,139
So, tell me the things
that made you sad all along.

55
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:21,740
I'll try to do better.

56
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,139
There's not much I want
from you, Mom.

57
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,180
All I want is your kind words,
a warm look in your eyes,

58
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
and loving touches.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,319
Those are enough.

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,689
Those were the things
I missed and envied the most.

61
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,930
I couldn't even do
such basic things for you.

62
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,469
It's because all I ever do is work.

63
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,939
All I did was work for the last 20 years
after losing you,

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,669
so I must be bad at that.

65
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,580
You're good at it.

66
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:00,849
- What?
- A warm look in your eyes,

67
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,180
kind words, and loving touches.

68
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,250
You're already capable
of doing those and more.

69
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,620
Oh, I see.

70
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,520
You always treat
Eun Chong like that.

71
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,100
Can you treat me...

72
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,370
just like how you treat him?

73
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,740
I see. Did I treat him like that?

74
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,240
I should've treated you like that
more often. I'm sorry.

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,110
I'll be better from now on.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,579
Okay.

77
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,389
Is there anything
you want to do with me?

78
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,959
Was there anything
you wanted to do with me?

79
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,329
What were the things you wanted to do
when you found me?

80
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,930
Let's do those together.

81
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,230
I wanted to visit
art galleries together...

82
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,730
and take a stroll
in the ancient palace.

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,000
Now that we're on the subject,
why don't we go today?

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,410
I'd love to.

85
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,079
Ha Na, please don't be
suspicious of me,

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,920
and stay with me and Eun Chong
as my daughter as long as you live.

87
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,439
Du Na.

88
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,709
Why did my mom cry
while looking at you?

89
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,910
And why was this photo
I took with you...

90
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,480
found in Mom's room?

91
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,149
Could everything be a coincidence?

92
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,550
You two went to the same university.
Have you two ever met?

93
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,550
There are lots
of international students there.

94
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,990
I wasn't in the same community
as other international students.

95
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:27,290
Again, congratulations
on your wedding.

96
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,529
Good luck to you two.

97
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,430
Director Goo lives in our apartment?
Are you serious?

98
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,560
I met him at the entrance.

99
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,029
Should we move?

100
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,870
He moved in...

101
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,170
next to our newlywed home
on purpose.

102
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,540
How far will he take this?

103
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,209
Mother seemed to know him, too.

104
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,779
Is Mr. Goo the man she's seeing...

105
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,449
right now?

106
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,220
What's your plan today, Yeo Jin?

107
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,800
Yu Jin and I are going out.

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,160
I want to go, too!

109
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,930
- Eun Chong, do you want to go, too?
- Yes.

110
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,939
Then, you need to ask Auntie Ha Na
for permission.

111
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,139
Of course, you're coming with us.

112
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,310
But first, you have to eat a lot.

113
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,709
Okay.

114
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,879
Where are you going?

115
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,579
We planned to go to an art gallery
and stroll at the palace,

116
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,750
but if Eun Chong would join us...

117
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,519
Should we go somewhere
he'd want to go?

118
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,290
I'm happy with anything
if you're happy.

119
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,889
Where do you want to go, Eun Chong?

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,860
The Trick Art Museum.

121
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,430
Sure, enjoy this all you want
while you can.

122
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,300
There won't be a curtain call
when this play ends.

123
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,709
Eat up, Eun Chong.

124
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,709
Act like you're really flying.

125
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:52,980
You look like you're really flying.

126
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,610
Stretch your fists a little more.
A little higher.

127
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,579
Swoosh! All right!

128
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,819
Look over here.

129
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,560
Great job.

130
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,660
What does it look like?

131
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,329
Oh, my.

132
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,029
Okay. Stay right there.

133
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,170
Okay. One moment.

134
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,740
Excuse me.
Can you take a picture for us?

135
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,970
- Sure.
- Thank you.

136
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,300
- Mom, stand there.
- What? Okay.

137
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,910
- I'll take it now.
- Okay.

138
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,069
One, two.

139
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,110
One, two.

140
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,509
One, two, three.

141
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,649
One, two, three. Click!

142
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:47,799
Have you run
a background check on me?

143
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,070
- Or was it Goo Ji Seok?
- It doesn't matter who it is.

144
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,070
This is great.
It had been uncomfortable for me.

145
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:59,779
Should I thank you for running
a background check to confront me?

146
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,909
How can you say that
after deceiving me?

147
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,220
I didn't deceive you.
Everything happened in the past.

148
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,419
Do I have to tell you about my ex
from two years ago?

149
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:08,889
You shouldn't have been caught.

150
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,919
You should've kept it a secret
until the end.

151
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,289
I never deceived
or hid this from you.

152
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,490
Was it a sin to have dated someone?

153
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,929
Was it a sin that I didn't tell you
the man who took your position...

154
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,200
as the head director was
actually my ex-boyfriend?

155
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:23,799
If I had told you,

156
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,669
would you have said,
"Is that so? Thanks for telling me?"

157
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,340
Fine, let's say
you didn't have to tell me.

158
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,539
But why do I feel this awful?

159
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,549
Do you want to explain the reason?

160
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,179
How would I know? You tell me!

161
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,049
You said everything was over,

162
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,820
but it didn't look like it to me.

163
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,720
Mother knows
all about you and him, doesn't she?

164
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,830
Then, it probably wasn't
a casual relationship.

165
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,629
She only knew
that we dated in the States.

166
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,299
She had met him
when she came to visit me.

167
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,639
So, both my mom and I were in shock
when he showed up.

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,779
Why was he the one
who took your spot?

169
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,610
And he moved in next door, too.

170
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,049
He probably did that on purpose
to show himself to you.

171
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,190
That means he's still not over you.

172
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,549
But I am.

173
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,220
You can ask him
if you don't believe me.

174
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,200
Was this why you wanted
to reconsider our relationship?

175
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,730
This has nothing to do with it.

176
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:33,269
He was just a guy
I dated in the past.

177
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,740
He's history.

178
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,769
Is he really only in your past?

179
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,639
You can call him over and ask
if you don't believe me.

180
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm not sure if he's home.

181
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,389
She'll want to expose Ha Na
as a fake and kick her out immediately.

182
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,120
I need to find something
to stop Choi Myung Ji immediately.

183
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,990
Choi Myung Ji...

184
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,759
would've created a slush fund
behind Chairwoman Shin's back.

185
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,960
The real estate transactions
she made under her name...

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,230
didn't show any problems.

187
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,440
We should find her accounts overseas
or ones made under borrowed names.

188
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
I'll look those up.

189
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,940
Is there a way
to find some through Yoon Se Young?

190
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,210
I was...

191
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,149
thinking of a way.

192
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:15,909
"Call him over and ask?"

193
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,789
You can't care any less
about how I feel, can you?

194
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,889
The guy you had dated
sold my company!

195
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,220
And to me, it doesn't seem like...

196
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,799
you two are over.

197
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,629
Did you think
I was still seeing him?

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,370
I'm not insane.

199
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,299
I'm about to marry you.
Why would I do that?

200
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,240
This was why I couldn't tell you.

201
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,909
I knew I'd be
unfairly misunderstood.

202
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,610
I said we should move
when he moved in next door.

203
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,279
We should've done that.

204
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,090
Honestly speaking,
you aren't the one to talk.

205
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,919
My ex is history,
but your thing is ongoing.

206
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,889
- What do you mean?
- You and Goo Ha Na were...

207
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:01,889
in more than a few scandals.

208
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,490
You didn't tell me
she was Yu Jin, either.

209
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,799
I didn't date her.

210
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,669
Those two don't compare.

211
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,470
I hate it
when people blame both sides.

212
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,769
"Everyone is bad.
Everyone is at fault."

213
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,740
Fine, let's say we're all at fault.

214
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,679
But how can you treat Goo Ji Seok
and Goo Ha Na the same way?

215
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,080
You're getting mad again
as soon as I mention Goo Ha Na.

216
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,250
So what?

217
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,279
I dated Goo Ji Seok in the past.
Now what?

218
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,789
Is this really history?
Nothing is going on now?

219
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,820
No, Goo Ji Seok is in the past,

220
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
and you're my future and present.
Happy now?

221
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,529
Then, on the day of our team dinner,

222
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,529
you said you were meeting
your friends to do a bridal shower.

223
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,259
Can you tell me who you were with?

224
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,100
I told you. The marketing team leader
from New York...

225
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,299
I know you didn't meet that person.

226
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,539
And you didn't meet your friends.

227
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,049
Fine. I lied.

228
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,620
Were you curious,
thinking I was probably with Goo Ji Seok?

229
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,320
You must've been with a guy
if you lied to me.

230
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,620
Come on.

231
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,190
Do I have to share this with you?

232
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,429
Fine. I'll tell you.

233
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,429
I lied to do some procedures
on my face before the wedding.

234
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,600
- "Procedures?"
- I was with a plastic surgeon.

235
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,470
You can't tell, can you?

236
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,039
My fiance is too inattentive.

237
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,309
I didn't have time
to meet another guy.

238
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,149
I barely had time to look prettier.

239
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,289
- Is this true?
- Do you want to see a receipt?

240
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,019
Do you want to know
the name of the clinic?

241
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,419
Why did you hide this?

242
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,129
No woman in this world
shares something like that.

243
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,929
Gosh.

244
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:46,230
If you don't believe me,
we can go there together.

245
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,169
What will it take
for you to believe me?

246
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,500
I think there are a lot
of lingering feelings between you two,

247
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,240
especially Goo Ji Seok.

248
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,879
He showed animosity
from the moment we met,

249
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,139
and he kept picking a fight
and provoking me like a habit.

250
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,110
You were the reason.

251
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,649
I don't know about him, but not me.

252
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,120
I have
no lingering feelings for him.

253
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,950
Please believe me.

254
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,220
I'll let this go
since you're denying it.

255
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,700
But don't tell Goo Ji Seok
that I know.

256
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,230
Okay.

257
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,639
All I think about is
how we'll be happily married...

258
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,240
and what I can do to be
a good daughter-in-law to Mother.

259
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,340
That's all I think about.

260
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,250
Please believe me. Please?

261
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,220
Please don't be mad.

262
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,559
Please?
We have to visit Mother's restaurant.

263
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,679
It's been a while
since I ran into you here, Mr. Hwang.

264
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,490
And you, Ms. Yoon.

265
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,659
Hello.

266
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,409
He must've found out
about Se Young and me.

267
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,250
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

268
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,250
My goodness. Are you okay?

269
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Goodness. Let me do it.

270
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,889
Oh, my.

271
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,629
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,100
Let me wipe this clean for you.
I'm so sorry.

273
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,470
Please enjoy.

274
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,799
Goodness.

275
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,100
- Hey.
- Mom, let me do it.

276
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Yes, okay.

277
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,440
Come with me.

278
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,139
We're sorry.

279
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,149
Only people who have done this can
help out easily, and that's not you.

280
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:21,190
I wanted to come and help you,

281
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,850
but I was nothing but a nuisance.

282
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,690
I'll do better next time.

283
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,190
You don't have to do this.

284
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,090
- You should have a seat.
- Okay.

285
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,970
Jin Goo,
can you massage my shoulders?

286
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Customers are watching.

287
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,370
You can go home if you're tired.

288
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,679
Are you still mad?

289
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,809
No.

290
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,450
- Yes.
- Let's go inside.

291
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,190
- You're here, Ms. Chairwoman.
- Hello.

292
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,960
- Hello, Ms. Bang Ul.
- Hey, there.

294
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,419
Eun Chong's here.

295
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,929
Where have you been?

296
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,860
We were out on a date.

297
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,329
Hello, Aunt Yeo Jin.

298
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,369
Hi, Eun Chong.

299
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,000
- Hello.
- Hey.

300
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,569
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

301
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,950
Here's your order.

302
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,079
Enjoy.

303
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,380
My gosh.

304
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,950
Can we really finish all these?

305
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,890
You love seafood,

306
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,089
and I do, too.

307
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,859
Let's eat as much as we want today.

308
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,259
I like seafood, too.

309
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,200
Do you? The three of us have
a similar appetite.

310
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,599
What's your favorite among these?

311
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,700
Let's see. I like...

312
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:47,440
clams, abalones, and scallops.

313
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,339
Okay. A scallop.

314
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,650
- An abalone.
- I can do it.

315
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,519
I want to do it for you.

316
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,990
I must stay diligent
to make up for everything I missed.

317
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,559
Were you troubled
by what I said to you?

318
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,460
It should trouble me.
I looked back on myself.

319
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,829
Let's eat.

320
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,299
Okay.

321
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,369
Were you scalded?

322
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:22,869
No, I'm fine.

323
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,170
Let me see it.

324
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,880
What a relief.

325
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,579
You should be careful.

326
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:36,490
- Are you really okay, Auntie Ha Na?
- Yes.

327
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,190
I'm fine. You should eat, too.

328
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,759
And these.

329
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,660
Gosh. You should eat, Mom.

330
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,759
Leave everything to me
when you eat today.

331
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,369
Thank you.

332
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,609
Let's eat.

333
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,410
And try some meat, too.

334
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,579
Mom, you should have it.

335
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,779
- Eat up.
- You can stop giving it to me.

336
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,410
What do you want, Eun Chong?

337
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,349
Aunt Yeo Jin is
too into her knockoff daughter.

338
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,220
And one for Eun Chong.

339
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,619
Do you need anything else,
Aunt Yeo Jin?

340
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,990
No, we'll order more later.

341
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,700
- You should sit and have a bite.
- Okay.

342
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,069
I'll just have some veggies.

343
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,269
- You can have this.
- Be careful.

344
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:38,920
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

345
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,920
- Goodness.
- I'm sorry.

346
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,490
Hey, stop it.
You're smearing it even more.

347
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,490
Oh, no.

348
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,329
Is there a clothing store nearby?

349
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,200
What happened?
You should get changed.

350
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:56,769
Mr. Hwang,
can you let her borrow your top?

351
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,640
Mine?

352
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,019
Jin Goo found out everything.

353
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,500
I said it was all in the past,
that we broke up two years ago.

354
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:33,140
- Did he believe you?
- I made him believe me.

355
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:35,670
I knew it.

356
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,940
Hwang Jin Goo looked rigid
like a plaster cast.

357
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,579
He had been suspicious all along.

358
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,250
He already knew about how I lied...

359
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,980
to leave the team dinner
and when I said I met my friends.

360
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,890
And? Was everything fine?

361
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,619
Yes, don't make it seem like
you know that he knows.

362
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,690
Don't let it show. Okay?

363
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,930
Okay.

364
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,599
If Hwang Jin Goo knows,

365
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,170
it'll be a matter of time
before the engagement is off.

366
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:07,670
Come in.

367
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,440
Eun Chong, can you go to your room?

368
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,809
I have to talk to Auntie Ha Na.

369
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,750
Right. You can go inside.

370
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,220
I couldn't believe
you borrowed my guy's shirt.

371
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,259
You spilled the sauce on me
on purpose. What did you expect?

372
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,259
Then, why didn't you
give me your shirt?

373
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,960
Why should I give you my shirt?

374
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,069
- It's so demeaning.
- What?

375
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:37,529
- Why? Are you going to hit me?
- I'm not you.

376
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,599
Why would I resort to violence?
It's so demeaning.

377
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,609
You need to get your act straight...

378
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,910
before you come
and pick a fight with me.

379
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,380
You were caught two-timing.

380
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,579
What now? You two are history?

381
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,579
You're still seeing someone.

382
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,450
- You haven't even seen me.
- You should end that soon.

383
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:57,890
If you don't,
I'll tell Mr. Hwang everything.

384
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,059
That you are
still seeing someone else.

385
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,589
All right. Go ahead and tell him.

386
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,029
It'll be fun to watch
who gets hurt in the end.

387
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,769
What was that?
Who will it hurt in the end?

388
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:17,869
Me?

389
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:23,509
She has no idea it's her brother.

390
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,549
How dare some knockoff
who'd get kicked out soon...

391
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,119
threaten me and try to teach me?

392
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,160
Why are you so sour again?

393
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,359
Goo Ha Na is annoying me.

394
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,230
I need to make that brat
walk out of this home on her own.

395
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,200
I can't think of a way.

396
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,109
Could we find Yu Jin's photos
when she was ten?

397
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,539
The shaman told us to burn everything,
so you took it all.

398
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,509
Exactly. I should've left just one.

399
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,180
Maybe Aunt Yeo Jin has one.

400
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,589
She removed everything
before her fake daughter moved in.

401
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:06,990
She must've left it in a safe
outside of this home.

402
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

403
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,509
What about the flyer
printed in the newspaper?

404
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,410
The flyer
we used to look for Yu Jin?

405
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,079
- Yes.
- Do you have it?

406
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,380
I saw it at Goo Ji Seok's place
on that day.

407
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,519
I talked big,

408
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,730
but it'd be weird to interfere
in their relationship.

409
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,259
But I can't turn a blind eye
to how Mr. Hwang is deceived.

410
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,900
Gosh, what do I do?

411
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,920
Goo Ji Seok is in the past,

412
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,849
and you're my future and present.
Happy now?

413
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,190
I don't know about him, but not me.

414
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,660
I have
no lingering feelings for him.

415
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,529
Please believe me.

416
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,500
Should I believe her?

417
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,039
Gosh, this feels so nice
whenever I use it.

418
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,339
My hair feels so soft
even without the conditioner.

419
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,880
What's going on? Who are you?

420
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
What? Hey, it's me.

421
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:43,349
Gosh, why are you
washing your hair here? Come on!

422
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:52,759
Hey, you must use a nice shampoo.

423
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,730
It looks different
even to you, too, right?

424
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:58,339
I don't shed as much hair,

425
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,740
and it gives me so much volume.

426
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,970
It's my favorite shampoo.

427
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,240
Leave it here before you go.

428
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,609
Let me add some volume
to my hair, too.

429
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,009
I knew you'd notice
how good this was.

430
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,579
You can use as much as you like.

431
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,519
Thank you. All right.

432
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,029
It's too dangerous to list Eun Chong
under your family register.

433
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,099
Are you telling me
to lose my grandson to Ha Na?

434
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,670
Why do you think
you'll lose him to her?

435
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,670
You should trust her.

436
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,039
A few days ago, she proceeded with
the home visit without telling me.

437
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,069
She even made it seem like
a spontaneous visit.

438
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,009
She deceived me first.

439
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,680
It was probably
because of the false child abuse report.

440
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,849
Then, she should've talked to me.
I'm her mother.

441
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,589
When it came to Eun Chong's kindergarten,
she drew the line...

442
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,920
and said she was the guardian.

443
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,420
She said she'd manage
his adoption process, too.

444
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,059
She's just doing things
as she always has.

445
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:57,329
She lived
as the head of her household,

446
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:59,329
so she must be used
to taking responsibility.

447
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,500
Yes, I get everything.

448
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,839
And I want to live
the rest of my life as Ha Na's mom.

449
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,309
But I don't know
what Goo Ha Na will do...

450
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,880
when she finds out she's a fake.

451
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,250
She may deceive me,

452
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,680
and she may feel spiteful
and refuse to let me meet Eun Chong.

453
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,349
We'll make sure that doesn't happen.

454
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,319
I need to take a measure.
I can't just sit on my hands.

455
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,259
Please consider
what Eun Chong wants.

456
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:32,000
You should go back to the time
when you considered...

457
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,329
making Ha Na your daughter.

458
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,529
You said you'd make her happy,
just like Cinderella.

459
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,569
Does she look happy to you?

460
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,910
Does she not seem happy to you?

461
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,609
She did seem happy yesterday.

462
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,250
It was a day when you gave
more attention and focus...

463
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,119
to Ha Na instead of Eun Chong.

464
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,690
How often
did she spend days like those?

465
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,200
I'll make her happy from now on.

466
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,230
I thought long and hard
about adopting Eun Chong,

467
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,970
- so please look the other way.
- Ms. Chairwoman.

468
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,599
He'll find out...

469
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,640
who he is when he grows older,
and he'll understand.

470
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,380
I'm his biological grandmother.
Why would he be against it?

471
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:27,420
Who told you I was
Hyesung Group's daughter?

472
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,589
You told me.

473
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,519
What are you talking about?

474
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,019
Stop slandering me.

475
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,829
Tell me who told you.

476
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:38,700
I'll tell you
if you agree to marry Seok Ki.

477
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,930
I need to find out,
so I'll put up with her for now.

478
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,839
I'll talk to Seok Ki.

479
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,140
Will you do that?

480
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:53,279
Once you tell me
who told you I was...

481
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,210
But Ha Na, I really don't get it.

482
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,680
Why is it a secret
that you're her daughter?

483
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,279
I heard she found her dear daughter
after 20 long years.

484
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,990
She was afraid I'd be hurt, so...

485
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,759
It's nonsense to keep you hidden
because she's afraid you'll be hurt.

486
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,220
You're no longer
a seven-year-old kid.

487
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,789
She shouldn't have found you if she were
that worried about your safety.

488
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,299
Even if she did, she should've
kept it quiet and helped quietly.

489
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,529
That's what moms do.

490
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,940
Tell me how you found out
that I was her daughter.

491
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:24,140
You probably
weren't adopted, stolen,

492
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,880
or faked as a daughter.

493
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,980
I really don't get it
as another mom.

494
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,180
There is no reason...

495
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,819
to spend money
to keep this a secret.

496
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,819
You can stop going on about that.

497
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,190
Who told you I was her daughter?

498
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:45,130
By any chance, was it Aunt Myung Ji?

499
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,930
No, you told me!

500
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:50,930
Then, just marry Seok Ki.

501
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,599
I don't want to marry Seok Ki!

502
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,410
I'd find out who told you,

503
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,339
so take Seok Ki and go see a doctor.

504
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,150
What's so bad about my Seok Ki?

505
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,349
Gosh, that girl is so quick.

506
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:12,890
How did she know it was her aunt?

507
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,259
She asked if you heard it from me?

508
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,829
And?

509
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,670
Make sure you keep your mouth shut.

510
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,569
How did she grow suspicious of me?

511
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,210
I have to kick her out soon
before the suspicion grows.

512
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,019
We can use AI technology to change
old photos into videos.

513
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,589
We could restore great moments
moms and daughters had...

514
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:52,200
and send those to the guests
as another service.

515
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,859
It'll seem more lively...

516
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,630
to see it in a video,
so people will like that.

517
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,839
- That sounds great.
- That sounds great.

518
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,839
The chairwoman was highly interested
in the mother-daughter therapy tour.

519
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,480
Why don't we restore
her daughter's childhood photos...

520
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,079
into a video and give it to her?

521
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,880
That's a great idea.

522
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,210
Her daughter went missing at ten,

523
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,750
so she'd have lots of pictures.

524
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,920
I thought she was seven.

525
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,319
Seven? No, she was ten.

526
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:19,019
She was probably ten.

527
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,259
I heard she was ten, too.

528
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,960
I was ten?

529
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:29,230
Jin Goo was always brave
while fighting his illness.

530
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,500
That ten-year-old kid
went through the surgery bravely.

531
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,769
Ms. Sim also said
I was ten back then.

532
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:42,509
That's all for today's meeting.

533
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,950
- Great work.
- Great work.

534
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,420
(Disappearance
of Hyesung Group's daughter)

535
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,720
(This Month's Performance:
For those who need new music)

536
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,390
(More videos)

537
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,490
(Disappearance
of Hyesung Group's daughter)

538
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,259
I can't find any news articles.

539
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,279
Should I look up old newspapers?

540
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:19,079
I should go to the library
on the weekend.

541
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,849
Then, what about
your daughter's disappearance?

542
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,319
I believe she went missing at ten.

543
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,220
But Ha Na came to my place at ten.

544
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,829
Ji Seok also thought
she went missing at ten.

545
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,769
Se Young must know the accurate age.

546
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,450
How old was I when I went missing?

547
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,250
Why are you asking me?

548
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,680
I was ten, right?

549
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,549
You already know. Why did you ask?

550
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,289
Did she notice that she was a fake?

551
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,329
Anyway, why do you suddenly ask?

552
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,700
I was 10, right? I wasn't 7, was I?

553
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,500
Did she think
Yu Jin went missing at seven?

554
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,900
Seven? That was random.

555
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,339
You were ten.

556
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:19,440
I almost went missing with you
at that time.

557
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,539
(Cinderella Game)

558
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,609
I can't let Ha Na
begin to get suspicious.

559
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:24,809
You'll soon find out you're a fake.

560
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,079
You need to tell the world
that Ha Na is your daughter.

561
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,450
I do want the world to know
that I'm her daughter.

562
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,279
- Are you avoiding me?
- Stop getting snarky...

563
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,349
and say what you want to say.

564
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,880
You'll be over
when the fake daughter gets exposed.

565
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,650
It's finally time to tell the world
that Yu Jin is my daughter.

566
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,589
I can't let this happen,
not even over my dead body, Yeo Jin.

567
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,660
I'm afraid to find out
how this lie will end.
