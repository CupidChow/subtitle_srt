1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,150
(Episode 93)

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,990
Come on in, Yeo Jin.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,560
Welcome back.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,260
You should've died at the hospital.
Why did you return?

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,730
You'll only get in trouble again.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,300
I came to get you.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,510
I'll find the evidence and kill you.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,210
Did Sung Ho not come with you?

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,280
You said he was after my fortune.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,120
That's true.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,860
What's wrong, Yeo Jin?

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,500
Which one's my room?

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,170
It's this one.

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,410
Why did she look at the staircase?

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,610
She doesn't even remember
the time of her collapse.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,550
What are you looking at?

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,060
So, this is my room?

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,070
Does it feel familiar?

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,440
It's a bit awkward
with cameras all around,

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,510
but what's important is
that you feel at peace.

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,180
I don't remember anything,
so I feel scared to be alone.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,250
I know. That was a wise decision.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,820
Yeo Jin, how much do you remember?

27
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,820
You remembered Eun Chong, too.

28
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,560
I just remember meeting him,
and that's all.

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,160
I heard he was Yu Jin's son
and my grandson,

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,760
so I took everyone's word for it.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,130
Then, what about Yu Jin?

32
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,670
How much do you remember?

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,540
I lost Yu Jin, then found her again.

34
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,310
You're home now,
so you'll remember everything soon.

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,420
Yes.

36
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,050
This means
she barely remembers anything.

37
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,690
Yeo Jin,
what do you want to eat for dinner?

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,660
I would've prepared something
if I knew you were coming.

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,570
Ms. Jang and Yu Jin will
take care of my meals from now on.

40
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,340
Well, why?

41
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,800
I should do it.

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,840
Let them handle what I eat.

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,640
Okay.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,050
I know you're capable
of poisoning my food.

45
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,950
Yeo Jin, it's not that
you don't trust me, is it?

46
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,120
Why wouldn't I trust you?

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,420
You said you spent 20 years
tending to my needs.

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,660
If anything, I should be
sharing my fortune with you.

49
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,690
You don't have to.

50
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,760
Make sure you keep your word.

51
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,670
Excuse me.

52
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,310
Hello?

53
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,250
The hit-and-run driver got arrested?

54
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,610
How did this happen so soon?

55
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,750
I had a good talk with the driver,
so don't worry about it.

56
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,820
Are you sure I won't have to worry?

57
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,260
Make an offer
to hire a good attorney.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,560
Yes. The victim's family
may try to visit the perpetrator,

59
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,860
so prohibit all visits
other than the attorney.

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,700
Sure.

61
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,700
Keep reporting back often.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,470
Bye.

63
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,870
Why was the driver caught as soon as
Yeo Jin returned? It's just my luck.

64
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,710
Jin Goo
must've received a call, too.

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,610
A mistake
caused by inexperienced driving?

66
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,150
It wasn't a mistake.

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,050
I understand for now.

68
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,860
The driver claimed to have fled
after hitting her by mistake.

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,760
It sounds like a plan
to take the blame alone.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,860
I need to meet the driver.

71
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll meet the chairwoman
and tell her in person.

72
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,730
They killed my daughter
and called it a mistake?

73
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,230
I can't believe these jerks.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,110
I need to see the culprit
who killed Yu Jin.

75
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,180
Yes, you must.

76
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,750
I'll make the culprit say...

77
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,680
that Choi Myung Ji was
the one behind everything.

78
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,390
The request was declined?

79
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,460
Yes, you aren't allowed
to make a visit.

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
If the victim's family
demands a visit,

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
there shouldn't be
an option to decline.

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,800
Tell the driver
to keep refusing the visits.

83
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,840
Bye.

84
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,310
I'm sure the three are
talking about the hit-and-run case.

85
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,510
What can they discuss with Yeo Jin
if she doesn't remember?

86
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,750
Are her memories really not back?

87
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,930
Yeo Jin, is something going on?

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,730
- Why?
- I was wondering...

89
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,470
what you three had to discuss.

90
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,600
You don't even remember anything.

91
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,270
I don't, so we talked about the past,
trying to get it back.

92
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,340
You can do that with me.

93
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,450
You must've heard
about the culprit getting caught.

94
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,310
How can you act so nonchalantly?

95
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,750
I'll wait until the day
I see you drop tears of blood.

96
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,750
Then, please excuse me.

97
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,090
Mom, get a good rest.

98
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,590
Okay.

99
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,300
What about the past
did you discuss with them?

100
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,670
About the time when I lost Yu Jin.

101
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,610
If the driver
refuses to accept visits,

102
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,110
it seems like
the blame will only go there.

103
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,780
Yes. The sentence will be lighter
for an inexperienced driver...

104
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,290
than a hired hitman.

105
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,420
It won't be easy
to persuade the culprit.

106
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,990
If we find the notebook right now,
it'll be game over.

107
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,130
It'll be game over.

108
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,430
Auntie Ha Na?

109
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,350
What's wrong?

110
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,150
Hey. Let go of my hand.

111
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,550
My gosh.

112
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,120
Oh, my.

113
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,490
Keep holding your hands.

114
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,960
Keep holding each other's hands,
and don't let them go.

115
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,830
You two are holding hands!

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,300
You can get married now.

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,640
Shall we?

118
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,210
She's my woman!

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
My goodness.

120
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,540
The driver
refused to accept visitors?

121
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,310
Myung Ji already made sure
no word got out.

122
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,110
Thanks, Myung Ji.

123
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,950
What? About what?

124
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,580
You said you saved my life.

125
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,990
I heard you found me
and took me to the hospital.

126
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,560
I still shudder
whenever I think of that day.

127
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,630
I was in such shock that
the worst might happen to you.

128
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,270
Is that so?

129
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,100
You're lying through your teeth,
you despicable thing.

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,500
So, do you not remember anything?

131
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,110
No, nothing other than the notebook.

132
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,640
What kind of a notebook was it?

133
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,550
Do you remember what it looks like?

134
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,720
I just remember seeing a notebook.

135
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,950
Ms. Jang looked for it,
but it didn't seem to be at home.

136
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,160
- When you found me on the floor...
- The thing is,

137
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,730
I didn't see any notebook
when I got there.

138
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,100
If it wasn't you,
then who could've taken it?

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,430
- Would Se Young know?
- She didn't see anything, either.

140
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,440
If it's somewhere at home,
it'll show up someday.

141
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,280
What was that notebook?

142
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,850
How come I remembered that?

143
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,080
You'll never find it, Yeo Jin.

144
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,430
The police?

145
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,530
Driving under the influence?

146
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,990
Se Young.

147
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,160
Yoon Se Young.

148
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,070
Ji Seok.

149
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,970
You're here again.

150
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,540
Why did you drive after drinking?
You should've hired a driver.

151
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,150
I wanted to kill myself.

152
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,920
Are you here alone?

153
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,480
Are you Ms. Yoon's guardian?

154
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,650
I'm her guardian.

155
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,290
Goodness. You're such a mess.

156
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,690
Get up.

157
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,560
Why did you drive after drinking?

158
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,900
Mom. You're here, too.

159
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,110
This is such a funny mix.

160
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,880
How can you laugh right now?

161
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,110
Why do you look fine?

162
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,010
I came because the police called.

163
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,050
You won't be able to meet
any marriageable guys...

164
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,760
if people hear about you
driving under the influence.

165
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,290
I hear the second son of Jeongil is
the most reckless party boy.

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,530
A rich and reckless party boy.

167
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,900
A rich...

168
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,870
Be quiet and get up. Now.

169
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,340
Come on.
Put your shoes on. Let's go.

170
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,220
Careful. My goodness.

171
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,490
Come with me.

172
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,130
- Aunt Yeo Jin! I'm here.
- What's with you?

173
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,660
Be quiet.

174
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Aunt Yeo Jin!

175
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,270
Aunt Yeo Jin!

176
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,140
Aunt Yeo Jin,
congratulations on your discharge.

177
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,140
What happened? What's going on?

178
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,940
She's usually not like this.

179
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,750
You don't have to mind her.
You should go back.

180
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,120
Let's go.

181
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,120
My poor aunt.

182
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,560
She kept saying she felt bad...

184
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,630
about how you fell unconscious
and lost your memories.

185
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,170
Is that so? Thank you.

186
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,340
Aunt Yeo Jin.

187
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,270
I'm so sorry.

188
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,040
For the last 20 years, my mom...

189
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,050
My goodness. Se Young.

190
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,620
You can't sleep here.
What's with you?

191
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,090
My gosh. Wake up. Come on.
Get a grip on yourself.

192
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,660
Se Young!

193
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,330
There's a problem
between Se Young and Choi Myung Ji?

194
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,460
Yes. She must've asked her mom
about the suspicions.

195
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,830
Her mom would've denied it.

196
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,200
I think she admitted to it.

197
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,770
- Really?
- It must've been quite shocking.

198
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,240
She said we misunderstood...

199
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,340
and that her mother
didn't do those things.

200
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,380
But she's always drinking.

201
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,850
- Did you drink with her every day?
- No.

202
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,750
If she found out
about the hit-and-run accident,

203
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,660
could she stand
to see her mother again?

204
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,730
Se Young can use this as a chance
to stand on her own feet.

205
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,100
- You must be concerned.
- I don't know.

206
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,170
You look great.

207
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,970
Is Jin Goo good to you?

208
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,970
Yes, I feel at ease
when I'm with him.

209
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,340
He takes me for who I am.

210
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,140
I hear you're supposed to marry
someone you feel at ease with.

211
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
I didn't say I'd marry him. Gosh.

212
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,680
What about you?
Do you feel at ease with any woman?

213
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Yes, I heard the hit-and-run driver
claimed it was a mistake.

214
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,960
You need to do whatever it takes
to persuade him.

215
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,260
The driver refused to meet Mr. Yoon.

216
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,430
It's not so easy
to get to Choi Myung Ji.

217
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,780
You were still up?

218
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,150
Did you wake up from your sleep?

219
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,550
Did you always love to drink?

220
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,250
No.

221
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,890
Did I make any mistakes
when I came back?

222
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,030
You said you were sorry.

223
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,630
Did you feel bad for me?

224
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,060
Well, I...

225
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,640
felt bad when I saw you on the bed.

226
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,740
And how for the last 20 years,
your mom...

227
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,410
Well, that's...

228
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,180
She took care of me.

229
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,950
Your mom told me,
so I already knew that.

230
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,710
I see.

231
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,780
Would you like anything?

232
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,520
No, it's all right.
I came to get water.

233
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,760
And don't take your sleeping pill
after you drink alcohol.

234
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,600
I won't.

235
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,440
Wait, does she remember
that I take sleeping pills?

236
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,420
Get up.

237
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,750
- Why?
- Have you lost your mind?

238
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,760
Not only did you drive drunk,
but you said that to your aunt!

239
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,890
What did I say?

240
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,260
That for the last 20 years, I...

241
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,830
She thought I was saying
you took care of her for 20 years.

242
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,340
Really? Not that I deceived her
for the last 20 years?

243
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,100
She thought you said
I took care of her?

244
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,640
Yes.

245
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,210
She knew
I was taking sleeping pills.

246
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,010
Does she remember
something like that?

247
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,680
How did you know that?

248
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,990
She told me not to take it
after I drink alcohol.

249
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm not sure
if her memories are back or not.

250
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,360
It's confusing.

251
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,300
We were turned down yesterday.
We were declined again?

252
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,670
I just need to meet the driver once.

253
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,100
Please relay that
one meeting will be enough.

254
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,910
I'm sorry. Inmates still have
the right to refuse visitors.

255
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,520
How can this happen?
That driver killed my daughter.

256
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,220
How can that driver call it a mistake
and refuse to see us?

257
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,560
I need to see that person's face.

258
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,760
I need to know
who did that to Yu Jin.

259
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,200
I have to see them in person.

260
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,470
I'll come every day
until the day I'm accepted.

261
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,040
I'll write letters
and bring food from outside, too.

262
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,010
That person must have family, too.

263
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,180
You should persuade that family.

264
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,080
The address wasn't accurate,
so I couldn't find them.

265
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,820
So, I prepared a news article...

266
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,280
on the possibility of someone
instigating the hit-and-run case.

267
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,750
An article on someone
instigating the accident?

268
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,690
Myung Ji will feel accused
and start moving.

269
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Let's put a tail on her
and find out where the notebook is.

270
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,430
"A ledger of transaction records
was found,"

271
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,100
"suggesting there was someone
behind the hit-and-run accident."

272
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,940
Choi Myung Ji will have to move
after seeing this about the ledger.

273
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,950
Yes, I really wonder
where she could've hidden it.

274
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,080
How did you
come up with this idea...

275
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,520
to lure Choi Myung Ji
to where she's hiding the notebook?

276
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,450
I just did.

277
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,390
Then, do you also know
how to lure a man?

278
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,330
No.

279
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,200
Why don't you lure me?

280
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,400
To where?

281
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,270
Into your heart.

282
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,540
Well, I didn't have to.
You made your way there already.

283
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,180
That's right.

284
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,720
The hit-and-run case already sounds awful,
but someone's behind it?

285
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,890
She was the chairwoman's daughter,
so did someone want to kill her?

286
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,160
It's so horrible.

287
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,860
Who could be behind this?

288
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,360
I say it's someone close to her.

289
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,360
Me, too.

290
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,840
Ms. Yoon,
have you read the news article?

291
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,040
What news article?

292
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,910
About the hit-and-run accident
the chairwoman's daughter was in.

293
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,410
"The hit-and-run accident?"

294
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,680
Mom, did Yu Jin die
in a hit-and-run accident?

295
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,150
What do you mean?

296
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,260
It must be.
There's a news article on it.

297
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,420
What news article?

298
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,060
"The Hit-and-Run Driver
of Hyesung Group's Daughter..."

299
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,400
"Arrested after Seven Years..."

300
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,900
"with Suspicions of an Instigator."

301
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,640
"An instigator?"

302
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,470
Then, someone must be behind it.

303
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,240
Did you know about this?

304
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,180
How would I know?
Yeo Jin just said it was a car accident.

305
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,850
Does this mean
Aunt Yeo Jin also didn't know?

306
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,750
So, why did this article
suddenly get published?

307
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,820
Well, let's hang up for now.

308
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,260
Mom.

309
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,100
Did Yu Jin die
in a hit-and-run accident?

310
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes, you didn't know?

311
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,470
Your mom probably knows.

312
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,340
She said she didn't.

313
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,570
Someone made the driver do this.

314
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,110
The real perpetrator is
someone else.

315
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,810
We need to catch that person,
but it's not so easy.

316
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,880
How do you know
someone's behind this?

317
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,950
The article says there's a ledger.

318
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,890
Your mom is that person,

319
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,860
and that notebook is the ledger.

320
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,890
Will it benefit us or not
for Se Young to know?

321
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,260
Is she suspicious of my mom?

322
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,430
It can't be her.

323
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,770
They found the ledger?

324
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,250
By that, it must mean my notebook.

325
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,880
How did anyone find it?
It's in my safe.

326
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,820
Wait, did it go missing?

327
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,990
My goodness.

328
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,130
Goodness, Yeo Jin.

329
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,680
Is something going on, Yeo Jin?

330
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,380
Did you lose a notebook?

331
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,550
What? No.

332
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,320
I need to go somewhere in a hurry.

333
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,420
Where?

334
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,750
Well, it's some business.

335
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,290
Can I come with you?

336
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,160
You want to come with me?

337
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,200
You said we were like sisters
for the last 20 years.

338
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,040
What is she doing?
She's creeping me out.

339
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,700
You should go, then.

340
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,440
Right. Okay.

341
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,010
Lead the way
to where the notebook is.

342
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,860
My gosh. It's still here.

343
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
(Cho Byung Jin: October 7, 2018,
550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

344
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,540
Wait, then what's the ledger
the news article talked about?

345
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,440
Was it a false report?

346
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,780
I confirmed
the location of her safe.

347
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,220
I'll find a way to open it.

348
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,850
Do you think
she'll move it to another place?

349
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,490
If she does, we'll find it again.

350
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,690
Call me as soon as you find a way.

351
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,830
I'm glad I lured her
with that article.

352
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,940
Yeo Jin.

353
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,440
- Hey, you're back already?
- Yes.

354
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,780
("The Hit-and-Run Driver
of Hyesung Group's Daughter...")

355
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,610
Why is she reading this article?

356
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,450
I heard about this fake news...

357
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,690
that said my daughter died
in a hit-and-run accident.

358
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,190
It was so elaborate,
so even I almost fell for it.

359
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,390
Is that so?
I should take a look, too.

360
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,930
Does she remember or not?

361
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,440
Did Sung Ho publish this?

362
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,740
You must be confused and wondering
if I got my memories back or not.

363
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,510
Gosh. Yeo Jin, I must go upstairs.

364
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,850
Could it be Detective Cho?

365
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,930
Did you see the article?

366
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,160
Did that punk rat me out already?

367
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,470
Otherwise, why would it say
someone was behind it?

368
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,700
No one knows about this!

369
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,740
And that ledger it mentions
also looks suspicious.

370
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,140
Myung Ji, do you keep a ledger?

371
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,780
There's no such thing.

372
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,550
I hear Sung Ho
tries to make a visit every day.

373
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,190
Wrap up the case as soon as possible
before he writes a letter...

374
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,420
and tries to win the driver over.

375
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,960
Yeo Jin was the only one
who saw that ledger.

376
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,300
Does she remember everything?

377
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,900
Should I get a new safe first?

378
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,550
Hello.

379
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,950
I am the father of Yoon Yu Jin,

380
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,820
the victim of the hit-and-run accident...

381
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,430
you caused
under Choi Myung Ji's order.

382
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,730
I went to see you yesterday and today,
but I was turned down...

383
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,970
and had to leave.

384
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,430
It's W.

385
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,770
Seven years ago,
my daughter had a one-year-old son.

386
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,510
If I must drop this case
without uncovering the truth...

387
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,040
about my daughter's death,

388
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,950
I won't be able to face her
as her father...

389
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,750
and her son's grandfather
even after I pass away.

390
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,750
V.

391
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,690
I hear you also have a child.

392
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,030
Please meet with us just once.

393
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,480
Hey! All we have to do now is
find the passcode to the safe.

394
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,680
You did something really big.

395
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,650
You deserve a reward.

396
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,890
Well, I'll take it if you offer one.

397
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,860
What was that?
What if someone sees us?

398
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,500
That's the fun of dating at work.

399
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,100
Jeez.

400
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,140
Gosh.

Did Yu Jin die
in a hit-and-run accident?

403
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,910
Yes, you didn't know?

404
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,140
Your mom probably knows.

405
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,250
How would I know?
Yeo Jin just said it was a car accident.

406
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,920
How did Ha Na know that my mom knew?

407
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,390
Gosh, no.

408
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,760
Don't listen to Ha Na.

409
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,530
Mom said she didn't know.

410
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,330
I only have to trust my mom.

411
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,230
You can't do anything without me.
What would you have done?

412
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,170
What can I do without Mom?

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,930

locked up behind bars,

I'm me.

If I don't know what it's like
to live as Yoon Se Young,

421
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,490
how am I supposed to live?

422
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,490

423

You're you.

424
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,230
You can find yourself starting now.

425
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,900
Where am I going to go to find that?

426
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,430
She was everything in my life,
and I always looked up to her.

427
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,840
How do you think you'd feel
if she completely fell apart?

428

- Ms. Yoon is here.
- Okay.

429
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,160
Here's your cardigan.
I didn't get to wash it.

430
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,360
It's fine.

431
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,160
I hear the second son of Jeongil is
the most reckless party boy.

432
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,900

433
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,740
Bye.

Then, you shouldn't have come
that day, either.

437
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,280
Why did you say you wanted to die?

438
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,310
Was it because of your mom?

439
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,420
Are all my problems
caused by my mom?

440
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,190
I'm just troubled
over my very existence.

441

Troubled over her existence?

442

Is there an update on who's behind
the accident? I want to know.

443

We thought Se Young
and her mom were behind this.

444
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,450
But that would make this
such a terrible and immoral story.

445
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,480
What do you think, Ha Na?

446
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,880
Suspicions mean nothing.
There has to be evidence.

447
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,990
We just need the driver to confess.

448
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,860
In dramas, people approach
the culprit, persuade them,

449
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,690
threaten them,
and even kill them, too.

450
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,030
That only happens in dramas.

451
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,200
So, does Chairwoman Shin
still not remember?

452
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,370
No, she remembered everything
and got discharged.

453
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,640
Really?

454
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,640
So, she's living with Choi Myung Ji?

455
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,210
Is it okay for her to live
with her enemy?

456
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,980
Oh, no.

457
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,990
The case was closed?

458
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,280
Everything wrapped up so quickly.
I made a fuss over nothing.

459
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,410
Yes. Good work.

460
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,120
I knew it. Luck was on my side.

461
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,560
It must be devastating for Yeo Jin.

462
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,930
Should I share my consolation?

463
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,470
She doesn't remember,

464
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,570
so she can't be devastated.

465
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,110
Eun Chong.

466
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,680
Do you know
how your mommy passed away?

467
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,250
In a car accident.

468
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,950
Yes, and the evil man...

469
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,090
who hit her with his car
got arrested.

470
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,890
- Really?
- Yes.

471
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,830
But he did it by mistake.

472
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,970
Still, isn't it a relief
that the culprit was caught?

473
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,430
- Don't you think so, Eun Chong?
- Yes.

474
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,740
Your mommy finally got justice,

475
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,170
so she can rest in peace now.

476
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,210
Gosh, everything is over.

all go out for dinner...

479
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,140
"By mistake?"

480
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,670
"Got justice? Rest in peace?"

481
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,770
How can you say such things?

482
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,640
"Everything is over?" What's over?

483
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,910
You already know how Yu Jin died!

484
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,920
Yeo Jin, do you...

485
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,290
Yes, I know what you did
seven years ago...

486
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,960
on the day Yu Jin died.
I remember it all.

487
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,200
It was all written in that notebook!

488

(Cinderella Game)

489
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,960
Nothing in this home is yours
other than your body.

490
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,430
- Leave as you are.
- Good grief!

491
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,830
Are we living here from now on?

492
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,270
I can't let her
kick me out like this.

493
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,400
Let's find evidence and request
a reinvestigation for the instigator.

494
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,570
Even if I pick and choose,
men are all the same.

495
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,370
There's evidence that your mom was
behind the hit-and-run accident.

496
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,040
Was my mom
really behind Yu Jin's accident?

497
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,410
I'll cuff your wrists...

498
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,150
and shut you up behind bars!

499
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,220
I'll make sure you never get out
while you're alive.
