1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,510
No, Eun Chong is not at fault.

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,480
- Don't go.
- Let go of me!

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,120
He's the blood of your enemy!

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,250
Yes, the chairwoman is
like my enemy.

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,160
- But Eun Chong is...
- He's the blood of our enemy...

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,490
who killed our parents!

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,600
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,500
The enemy who killed our parents?

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,510
Why did you think...

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,210
I cut ties with you
when you said you were her daughter?

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,440
Why did you think...

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,950
I sold off Hyesung Tour
and tried to take the group over?

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,280
You wanted to know, didn't you?

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,850
That's why.

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,850
Mom and Dad were killed...

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,320
by Chairwoman Shin?

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,160
Yes, the enemy who killed
our parents 13 years ago was...

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,930
Chairwoman Shin.

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,100
And Eun Chong is her blood.

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,440
Mom and Dad died in a car accident.

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,610
It wasn't just a car accident.

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,970
Then?

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,010
Hyesung Finance?

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,050
Mr. Goo was about to sign a big deal
with an international company.

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,820
Then, Hyesung Finance began
to pressure him to pay them back,

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,020
although he still had about a month.

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,760
He even said
he'd meet with her the day after,

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,490
but the accident broke out
on that day.

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,130
Was it intentional?

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,830
There was a dash cam in his car,

34
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,330
but it was gone
when the investigation began.

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,600
But I found a partial backup
while cleaning up the company's server.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,810
The video was damaged,
but you can hear his voice.

37
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,540
Take a listen.

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,180
What's wrong with the brakes?

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,610
Why are the brakes...

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,880
It was due to brake failure?

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,820
He always had his car checked up,
and there were no problems.

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,690
After the accident,
the contract we were to sign...

43
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,960
with the international company
disappeared.

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,260
When the deal got called off,

45
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,200
Chairwoman Shin took the company over
at a giveaway price.

46
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,770
I even have a witness account
that she staged the accident...

47
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,470
and colluded with the police
to cover it up...

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,770
as an ordinary car accident.

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,350
How can she do something like that?

50
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,720
I don't believe you.

51
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,180
I found it hard to believe, too.

52
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,450
Both how our parents
passed away like that,

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,290
and she'd do that to someone,
to a family just because of money.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,130
But everything is true.

55
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,140
Mom and Dad suffered
from such an unfair death?

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,170
Chairwoman Shin did that...

57
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,880
to our parents and our family?

58
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,780
Chairwoman Shin is still doing that.

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,880
You know what corporate raiding is, right?

60
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,650
Hyesung Group thrived
and became big...

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,820
on the sacrifices of the weak,
those like our parents.

62
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,420
And Eun Chong is
that woman's grandson.

63
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,360
She's someone
who'll reach her goal by any means.

64
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,600
She framed you
for the fake daughter scheme...

65
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,440
to prevent you
from seeing Eun Chong...

66
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,670
and even devised a plan to lock you up
in a mental institution.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,740
She may do worse in the future.

68
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,220
Auntie Ha Na, I'm here.

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,620
Don't come outside.
I'll tell him to leave.

70
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,380
You can't meet Auntie Ha Na.
Go home.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,210
What's going on?

72
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,550
Auntie and I promised to meet.

73
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,150
Please open the door.

74
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,850
Auntie Ha Na!

75
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,020
Don't come here from now on.

76
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,120
- You can't meet her even if you do.
- Why not?

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,390
Is something going on with Ha Na?

78
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,990
She's not going to meet Eun Chong,

79
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,730
so don't ever do something
this unnecessary.

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,740
Hey, Eun Chong. You're here.

81
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,840
Uncle Ji Chang...

82
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,180
Why aren't you going inside?

83
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,150
Why are the gates locked?

84
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,320
Open the door, Ji Seok.

85
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,290
Come in after they leave.

86
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,760
What are you doing, Ji Seok?

87
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,560
What's with him?

88
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,840
Is this some kind of a surprise?

89
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,150
Are you okay?

90
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,420
Do you need water?

91
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,990
Ji Seok.

92
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,460
Everything you said was true, right?

93
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,790
You weren't lying, were you?

94
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,800
I didn't leave out or add anything.

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,900
Everything is 100 percent true.

96
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,340
I couldn't tell you
because I knew you'd be...

97
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,910
this heartbroken.

98
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,950
But you should've told me
a long time ago.

99
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,850
Why did you suffer alone?

100
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,320
Even if I told you,

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
what could we have done
while we were that young?

102
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,150
We lived day-to-day...

103
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,590
trying to put food in our mouth,
so what could we do?

104
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,260
You kept this all to yourself...

105
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,030
and were broken at heart all alone
until this day?

106
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,970
I was going to tell you...

107
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
after I got their revenge.

108
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,040
Ji Seok...

109
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,880
This is just for you, though.

110
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,110
I'm not going to tell
Ji Eun or Ji Chang.

111
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,020
I'm sorry, Ji Seok.
I made you suffer all alone.

112
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,360
You would've done the same
even if you found out first.

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,520
Things will become hard...

114
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,290
now that you know.

115
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,830
Eun Chong is...

116
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,140
our family's enemy.

117
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,570
Just remember that.

118
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,450
- She won't pick up her phone.
- The person you have reached...

119
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,920
What are they doing in there?

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,030
You should probably go back today.

121
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,160
I don't want to.

122
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,370
I'm sleeping over
at Auntie Ha Na's place today.

123
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,770
To me, it looks like...

124
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,070
Auntie Ha Na and Uncle Ji Seok
had the biggest fight in history.

125
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,740
So, learn to read the room.

126
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,780
I'm going to wait here
until she comes out.

127
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,180
Hey, if you do,
you'll freeze to death.

128
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,580
The weather is still cold.

129
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,520
You need to leave with him.

130
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,660
Eun Chong, let's go home today.

131
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,560
We can call her
and come back tomorrow. Okay?

132
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,400
No, I was...

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
supposed to meet her after six days.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,240
Auntie Ha Na!

135
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,710
Auntie!

136
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,040
Auntie Ha Na!

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,440
- Hey, Eun Chong.
- Eun Chong.

138
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,850
Auntie Ha Na! Eun Chong is here!

139
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,950
Auntie Ha Na!

140
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,450
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Lee Eun Chong.

141
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,960
Let's go.

142
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,400
Auntie Ha Na!

143
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,240
I'm here!

144
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,400
Auntie Ha Na!

145
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,540
Auntie Ha Na, I'm here!

146
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,040
Auntie Ha Na!

147
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,200
Ha Na. The police said...

148
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,370
our mommy and daddy died.

149
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,340
No, right?

150
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,910
They didn't die, did they?

151
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,440
Right?

152
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,710
- Mom...
- Mommy...

153
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,080
Ha Na...

154
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,850
Have we become orphans?

155
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,790
I don't want to be an orphan.

156
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,600
- Mommy...
- Mommy...

157
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,910
Why are you crying?

158
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,440
- Who are you?
- We came from the bank...

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,540
for confiscation.

160
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,810
Our family was ruined.

161
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,280
It's all your fault.

162
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,320
Mom and Dad wouldn't have been
in that accident...

163
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,950
if you hadn't competed
in that piano competition.

164
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,320
It's all your fault!

165
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,750
Bring Mom and Dad back!

166
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Bring my mom and dad back!

167
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,730
- Bring Mom and Dad back!
- Mom, Dad, did you two die,

168
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,170
and were we made orphans...

169
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,600
because of Chairwoman Shin?

170
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,710
Were Du Na and Eun Chong...

171
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,610
the blood of my enemy,
the one who killed you?

172
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,620
How can she do this to me?

173
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,590
How can she do this to our family?

174
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,830
I'm so sorry, Mom, Dad.

175
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,890
What about the honeymoon trip?

176
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,720
She's in early pregnancy,
so they'll go later.

177
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,490
We'll go somewhere nearby
once I reach the stable period.

178
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,330
What?

179
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,070
Why are you back already?

180
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,210
He couldn't meet Ha Na.

181
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,670
Why not?

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,040
I don't know the reason.

183
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,610
Mr. Goo came out and said
they could never...

184
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,350
Ji Seok stopped them
from seeing her? Why?

185
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,690
She came and asked me to let them meet.
Why is she doing this?

186
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,090
I warned you.

187
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,400
I wouldn't hold myself back
if you messed with Ha Na again.

188
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,570
You planned to stash her
into a mental institution...

189
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,900
by making her appear schizophrenic.

190
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,970
Did he tell her that?

191
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,810
Was that why
she refused to see Eun Chong?

192
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,610
What's wrong, Eun Chong?

193
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,020
You must be mad.
Are you heartbroken?

194
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,950
Do you want some yogurt?

195
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,030
Here. Try some.

196
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,860
If you don't want yogurt,
do you want some fruit?

197
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,200
You'll be an older sibling
once the baby is born.

198
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,070
You need to be a brave boy.

199
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,040
Eat up.

200
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,710
That's not my sibling!

201
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,410
Oh, no.

202
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,780
I put this on
to go to the wedding shop.

203
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,650
That hit your stomach.
Are you all right?

204
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,220
She's fine.

205
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,750
It wasn't a hard throw.
You're fine, right?

206
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
Yes, I'm fine.

207
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,600
You need to act better
as a pregnant woman.

208
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,100
Make sure you stay alert
when you're with people.

209
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,400
Who cares about your clothes?

210
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,140
Whatever.
Eun Chong is stressing me out.

211
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,080
You have to appear sincere
when you deal with him.

212
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,680
Read that book on childbirth...

213
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,920
and pretend like
you're taking the supplements.

214
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,350
Fine.

215
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,660
Anyway, why is Goo Ha Na
suddenly refusing to meet Eun Chong?

216
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,020
Isn't this good news?

217
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,630
She fell out on her own.

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,330
It'd be great
if they didn't meet anymore.

219
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,670
But we'll still need someone
to handle Eun Chong.

220
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,670
Can we ask Mother to come?

221
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,670
She must be having fun making money.
Why would she come?

222
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,480
I'd feel too bad...

223
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,420
if the chairwoman paid
for all the dining expenses.

224
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,390
I'd love to pay for everything,

225
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,760
but let's split it in half.

226
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,430
The dining is costly
for a hotel wedding.

227
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,870
It'd cost at least
a couple hundred dollars per person.

228
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,500
- Is it that expensive?
- Yes.

229
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,010
I'll use some money, then.

230
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,840
I'll think of it as my share of pay
for the baby Se Young's coming with.

231
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,280
I think that's the best news.

232
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,520
The baby's our lucky charm.

233
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,630
No way. So, Eun Chong just left?

234
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,030
He cried a river.
I felt so bad for him.

235
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,140
She even made gimbap for him.

236
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,470
- Why did she keep the door closed?
- Tell me about it.

237
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,910
Right.
I might have heard her crying.

238
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,640
She was crying?

239
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,550
Anyway, I do know that
Ji Seok and Ha Na had a big fight.

240
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,650
Anyway, did you get the money?

241
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,190
I almost had a heart attack
after seeing the amount I got.

242
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,330
We have to keep it a secret
for a while.

243
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,400
If Ji Seok and Ha Na found out,
they'd tell us to return it.

244
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,330
Let's tell them after we make
much more money by investing.

245
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,470
Should I buy land or a house?

246
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,970
- Hey, you can buy both. All right!
- Yes.

247
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,590
It's unlike you to call
and want to see me outside.

248
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,790
Is Eun Chong that big of a deal?

249
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,630
Or is it because of Ha Na?

250
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,300
What's going on with Ha Na?

251
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,570
She even talked to him on the phone
and said they'd meet soon.

252
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,840
Why would she refuse to see him
after just a few dozen minutes?

253
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,700
She cut all ties with Hyesung Group,

254
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,740
even with Eun Chong.

255
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,880
She did?

256
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,210
- That's impossible.
- What do you know about her?

257
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,620
You saw how she refused
to see Eun Chong today.

258
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,280
She should've cut ties with him
long ago...

259
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,420
after everything
Chairwoman Shin did.

260
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,220
It was overdue.

261
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,690
Ha Na found out
what Chairwoman Shin was actually like,

262
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,360
which was why she decided
to distance herself from him.

263
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,930
That should be enough explanation.

264
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,600
But this was all too sudden.

265
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,400
Eun Chong is very unwell.

266
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,570
So what?

267
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,510
That family should
take care of their own blood.

268
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,710
I understand that family...

269
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,180
holds dearly to the philosophy
of "use and discard,"

270
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,320
but stop taking advantage of Ha Na.

271
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,350
- She'll also want to see...
- She severed her tie with him!

272
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,230
She's going to live her life
instead of looking after...

273
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,760
someone else's kid.

274
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,170
She'll date someone, get married,
and have children of her own.

275
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,140
If you really like her,

276
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,610
stop trying to get
Ha Na and Eun Chong involved.

277
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,340
Just get ready for your wedding.

278
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,860
She decided
to distance herself from Eun Chong?

279
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm craving your gimbap,
Auntie Ha Na.

280
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,350
Ms. Goo.

281
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,420
You were home.

282
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,930
Ji Seok told me everything just now.

283
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,830
Ji Seok even had
a near-death experience?

284
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,200
Yes.

285
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,900
It was probably tough
for Ji Seok to hold out...

286
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,040
when he went to America
with nothing in his pocket.

287
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,380
He went overseas
only to get his revenge,

288
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,950
but he witnessed Chairwoman Shin's
influence growing daily,

289
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,450
whereas he was
slowly facing a dead end.

290
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,220
He was probably
on the verge of giving up.

291
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,030
He was probably at the lowest point
when we first met.

292
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,130
I had no idea...

293
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,760
Ji Seok lived such a tough life.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,730
All I ever said was he was too cold
for not calling often.

295
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,410
He hoped his family
would never know until the end.

296
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,180
He didn't want to share
the burden with everyone.

297
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,380
He thought it'd be easier...

298
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,280
to handle this all alone.

299
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,290
What have I done with my life?

300
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,120
I put on air
raising my enemy's blood...

301
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,300
while Ji Seok was having
a lonely and hard fight to get revenge.

302
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,800
I only resented and blamed him,

303
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,440
thinking he wouldn't understand
how I was feeling.

304
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm such an idiot.

305
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,710
Don't be so hard on yourself.

306
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,580
You didn't know anything.

307
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,380
My ignorance is my sin.

308
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,210
How could I not know? We're family.

309
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,250
I feel so bad...

310
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,490
and sorry for Ji Seok.

311
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,170
He went overseas
only to get his revenge,

312
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,970
but he witnessed Chairwoman Shin's
influence growing daily,

313
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,610
whereas he was
slowly facing a dead end.

314
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,580
He was probably
on the verge of giving up.

315
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,250
He was probably at the lowest point
when we first met.

316
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,930
Ha Na.

317
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,200
What are you doing?

318
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,700
Let go of me. I deserve a beating.

319
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,210
- I deserve a beating!
- Stop it!

320
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,280
Please beat me up, Ji Seok.

321
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,180
Ha Na...

322
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,180
No, it wasn't your fault.

323
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,880
It's all right.

324
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,390
You didn't do anything wrong.

325
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,790
I'm sorry for making you fight
this lonely fight.

326
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,030
It's okay.

327
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,230
So stop hitting yourself.

328
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,470
It must've been so hard, Ji Seok.

329
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,400
- You.
- I don't want to eat!

330
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,440
What's wrong, Eun Chong?

331
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,410
Goodness, did he scratch your face?

332
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,750
He refused to eat the porridge
and scratched my face with nails.

333
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,350
Eun Chong, Auntie Se Young told you
to eat this in case you were hungry.

334
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,890
You can't scratch her face.

335
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,130
I didn't want to eat,
but she kept telling me to eat it.

336
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,960
Were you mad
because she tried to make you eat?

337
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,430
Yeo Jin, we should find an expert
who could take care of him.

338
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,270
Se Young is pregnant right now.

339
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,410
I don't think
finding an expert is the answer.

340
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,010
Should we ask Mother to come?

341
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,780
Do you mean Bang Ul?

342
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,120
No, I need to meet that girl.

343
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,910
Auntie, how do I look?

344
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,340
You look great!

345
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,410
Hula-hula!

346
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
What was that? How cute.

347
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,820
You're so cute!

348
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,720
He's my enemy's blood.

349
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,660
He's my enemy's blood.

350
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,540
Hey, I found 50 cents.

351
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,240
It was the most valuable 50 cents
in the world,

352
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,650
the money you made for me.

353
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,540
Auntie.

354
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,580
Auntie!

355
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,880
You were the one
who killed my parents...

356
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,890
and destroyed
our family's happiness?

357
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,560
(Please let our family be happy.)

358
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,530
Can we talk?

359
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,160
Should I go inside?
Or should we go somewhere?

360
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,530
Come in.

361
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,750
Cut to the chase,
then leave immediately.

362
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,990
- Let's sit down.
- I'll stand here.

363
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,650
I'll have to lift my eyes to you.

364
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,590
If you don't like that, go.

365
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,870
You must be quite angry with me.

366
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,170
Was that why
you sent Eun Chong back yesterday?

367
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,740
He was greatly disappointed.

368
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,180
He was only looking forward
to the day he'd meet you,

369
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,350
and he was so excited
about staying the night.

370
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,920
Did you feel less angry
after sending that boy home...

371
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,720
without even seeing his face?

372
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,360
Get to the point.

373
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,500
I wanted to come and apologize.

374
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,300
"Apologize?"

375
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,500
It was all my fault.

376
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,170
I was afraid Eun Chong would
leave me just as Yu Jin did,

377
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,910
so I was harsh on you,
unlike how I really felt.

378
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,010
Mr. Goo must've told you...

379
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,710
that I tried to lock you up
at a mental institution.

380
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,650
That was why you refused
to see Eun Chong.

381
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,090
That doesn't mean anything.

382
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,020
I didn't put it together
to make it happen.

383
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,460
So what?

384
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,130
I want to ask you to meet Eun Chong.

385
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,400
He must've been
greatly shocked after yesterday.

386
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,770
He's in bad condition.

387
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,640
Before, he only refused
to eat and sleep,

388
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,340
but that gentle boy
suddenly became very hostile.

389
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,510
He'll get better
if you come and see him.

390
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,420
After all, you're apologizing...

391
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,180
only for Eun Chong.

392
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,120
Just think of this
as a grandmother's heart.

393
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,790
I can do anything for Eun Chong.

394
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,020
That was why I made you my daughter.

395
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,700
But of course,
I've been regretting that.

396
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,830
Did you really?

397
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,530
What can I do
to make you believe me?

398
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,540
You said
you made me your fake daughter...

399
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,010
because you were worried
about Eun Chong's safety.

400
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,410
You were afraid
those who slander you might hurt him.

401
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,050
Weren't they all victims
of your corporate raids?

402
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,620
Answer me.

403
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,360
Did Mr. Goo tell you?

404
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,460
Do you even remember
each and every person?

405
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,960
What are you trying to say?

406
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,460
Reflecting on that, apologizing,
and compensating them...

407
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,230
would be the best move you can make
to protect him.

408
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,500
Do you plan to do that?

409
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,970
Your ignorance about business caused
a big misunderstanding.

410
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,040
These were just their incompetence.

411
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,940
I only stuck to the contract.

412
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
Corporate raids?

413
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,210
You can call anything that
if you frame it right.

414
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,180
You have no remorse.

415
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,090
I have no reason to.

416
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,020
I don't know
what kind of rumor you're hearing,

417
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,330
- but I'm innocent.
- "Innocent?"

418
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,660
I don't care what you say to me.

419
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,600
But Eun Chong didn't do
anything wrong.

420
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,630
His sin is that he's your grandson.

421
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,170
- What do you mean?
- Stop asking me.

422
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,740
You can ask yourself.

423
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,510
I won't see Eun Chong anymore.
Please leave.

424
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,940
I can offer you more money.

425
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,110
You lived as his mother until now,
and I told you that he was unwell.

426
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,850
Yes, I lived like an idiot,
acting as his mother.

427
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,250
All I got from doing that was
getting exploited by you...

428
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,860
and raising the blood of my enemy
who killed my parents.

429
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,830
I finally realized it.

430
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,300
Meeting Du Na
and raising Eun Chong was...

431
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,300
the biggest misfortune of my life.

432
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,500
Stop messing with me...

433
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,070
if you want to keep Eun Chong safe.

434
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,910
You shouldn't dare
to threaten me like that...

435
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,380
if you really raised him
like your own as you claimed.

436
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,480
Leave.

437
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,520
Reach out to me
if you change your mind.

438
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,940
How can she be like this
until the end?

439
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,820
She was hostile,

440
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,390
even spiteful.

441
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,290
It seems like something is going on.

442
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,890
What could be bigger
than her fake daughter incident?

443
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,130
It's even making her refuse
to see Eun Chong, too.

444
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,860
(Please let our family be happy.)

445
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,180
(The late Goo Young Min,
The late Cha Eun Jung)

446
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,380
Mom, Dad.

447
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,920
I had no idea
you two passed away like that.

448
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,260
Everything must've felt
so unfair and bitter...

449
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,200
as you passed away,

450
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,960
leaving your young children behind.

451
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,530
(The late Goo Young Min,
The late Cha Eun Jung)

452
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,370
I'm sorry for finding out too late.

453
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,380
I raised our enemy's blood...

454
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,350
while Ji Seok was
bearing all that burden...

455
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,890
and even got exploited by our enemy,

456
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,390
living a pathetic life
as our enemy's fake daughter.

457
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,960
Your hearts...

458
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,430
must've broken into pieces
as you watched me.

459
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,470
I'm so sorry.

460
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
(The late Goo Young Min,
The late Cha Eun Jung)

461
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,850
I'm done living my life like a fool.

462
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,030
The Goo Ha Na of the past...

463
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,230
is now gone.

464
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,000
- Have some.
- Thanks.

465
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,080
I was at our parents' memorial hall.

466
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,210
We should've gone together.

467
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,280
Did you cry?

468
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,310
Yes.

469
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,020
I realized how stupid and pathetic
I was as their daughter...

470
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,790
when I went to meet them
after finding out how they died.

471
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,520
I told you. It wasn't your fault.

472
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,860
- Blaming yourself ends today.
- Okay. I'll stop.

473
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,430
Take that heavy burden off...

474
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,560
and live your life
light as a feather.

475
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,000
You can start dating
and doing things you want to.

476
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,540
That sounds great.

477
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,680
Chairwoman Shin was at my place.

478
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,150
- Because of Eun Chong?
- Yes.

479
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,250
As you said,
she showed zero remorse.

480
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,550
I told you.

481
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,920
Did you date Se Young
as a part of your revenge?

482
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,360
I was wondering
if you approached her intentionally...

483
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,190
when you were in America
to get revenge.

484
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,030
You're still seeing her, right?

485
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,870
Yes, I'm seeing her
to use her for my revenge.

486
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,900
You've put in your entire life
into getting this revenge.

487
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,810
I wouldn't have started
without such determination.

488
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,580
Don't worry.
I'm not the old Ji Seok.

489
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,210
I now have power and money.

490
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,350
- And above all...
- You aren't alone.

491
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,390
Let me do it with you, Ji Seok.

492
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,090
- Do what?
- This revenge you're getting.

493
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,330
I want to join you.

494
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,260
I also want to put my entire life
into getting this revenge.

495
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
(Cinderella Game)

496
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,500
What do you think is
Chairwoman Shin's biggest weakness?

497
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,760
You will let me join you
in getting this revenge...

498
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
if I can take advantage
of Eun Chong, right?

499
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,830
The baby fell.

500
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,040
The adoption is off.

501
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,540
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

502
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,140
Kongkong, let's find Auntie Ha Na.

503
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,440
I don't see Eun Chong here.

504
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,610
He left by himself.

505
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,950
- He disappeared?
- Where could he have gone alone?

506
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,080
The tears she shed for her blood
must be true.
