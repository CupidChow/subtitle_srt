1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,550
(Episode 71)

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,450
Ha Na must be here
with a plan, right?

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,550
I think she's getting revenge on us
by using Eun Chong.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,220
Did Yeo Jin know...

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,630
what she was thinking
when she let that brat in?

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,160
Aunt Yeo Jin is awful, too.

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,200
How can she ask me
to move out of my room?

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,530
She must've been happy to hear
her grandson will get a room.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,370
But how can she take her side
on day one?

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm going to go to my newlywed home.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,810
You have to stay with Eun Chong.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,410
Just hang in there for a month.

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,210
How am I going to do that
without a room?

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,380
You can share it with me.

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,820
Let's wait and see...

19
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,090
- what Goo Ha Na is up to. Okay?
- Gosh.

20
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,650
Where's Jin Goo?

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,430
Come in.

22
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,760
Do you feel okay?

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,500
How can she be okay?

24
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,300
Are you playing cat and mouse?

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,140
Stop teasing her.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,380
Restore my room now.

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,180
You'll move out
when you marry anyway.

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,120
Then, do it after I move out.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,890
I don't have much time, either.

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,960
I have to finish everything
in a month.

31
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,090
Finish what?

32
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,390
Looking after Eun Chong.

33
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,330
No, it's your plan to steal him.

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,430
Will you take responsibility
if something happens to my baby...

35
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,800
because of the stress
you're causing?

36
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,000
But your baby fell.

37
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,270
What?

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,140
Her baby fell?

39
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,950
I saw Auntie Se Young...

40
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,150
and Little Grandma...

41
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,150
- when the baby...
- What are you talking about?

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,520
Eun Chong, have you been dreaming?

43
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,760
My baby is right here.

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,700
She took Se Young's room...

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,670
and made a playroom for Eun Chong
as soon as she came.

46
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,070
She must be
using Eun Chong as an excuse.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,740
It looks like
she has another intention.

48
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,810
Is she trying to take him?

49
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,020
I'm here.

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,490
I heard Se Young had a stomachache.
What's going on?

51
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,990
Goo Ha Na came today.

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,790
- Go upstairs.
- Yes, ma'am.

53
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,300
What did you mean
when you said the baby fell?

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,370
Auntie Se Young's stomach
dropped on the floor.

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,770
Her stomach dropped?

56
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,050
Did something happen
between you and Ms. Goo?

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,750
And what's with
the furniture outside?

58
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,050
Why are you in this room?

59
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,180
The first thing she did
after she came here was turn...

60
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,120
Se Young's room
into Eun Chong's playroom.

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,890
I can't believe this.

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,230
I feel so miserable, Jin Goo.

63
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,060
- What about your room?
- There are none.

64
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,660
She's telling her
to share it with me.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,070
She knew Se Young could be stressed
while she was pregnant, too.

66
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,930
And Yeo Jin took her side.

67
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,140
You should go to the doctor first.

68
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,710
If anything happens to the baby,
it's Goo Ha Na's fault.

69
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,630
I heard you came
as a live-in babysitter.

70
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,800
- Yes.
- How did you come...

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,860
to this decision?

72
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,570
I'll focus only on Eun Chong
until he gets better.

73
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,900
Thank you.

74
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,070
- For what?
- You made a tough decision...

75
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,540
for Eun Chong's sake.

76
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,010
It's weird to hear you thank me
for Eun Chong's business.

77
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,450
You'll be his dad
once you adopt him,

78
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,850
so I guess it's not odd.

79
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,050
Did I do something wrong?

80
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,660
Be careful.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,060
Jin Goo.

82
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,500
You can go with her
for an ultrasound...

83
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,600
and listen
to the baby's heartbeat, too.

84
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,270
Okay.

85
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,090
As you can see,
the baby is in a good position,

86
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,060
growing up in great health.

87
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,030
Would you like to hear
the heartbeat?

88
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,570
The heartbeat is at 150bpm.
The baby is very healthy.

89
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,830
You choked up when you heard
the baby's heartbeat, right?

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,300
It felt weird to hear the heartbeat.

91
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,740
Will I be able to do a good job?

92
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,080
I felt heavy with pressure, too.

93
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,510
And it finally hit me
that I'll have a child of my own.

94
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,280
I choked up, too.

95
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,520
I felt so sad to think our baby
almost grew up without a dad.

96
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,430
And try not to have bad thoughts
for the baby's sake.

98
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,400
That's what I want to do,

99
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,560
but everything is stressing me out.

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,470
It's not just me, though.
I feel so bad for our baby.

101
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,410
What if our baby is...

102
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,510
treated like dirt, just as I am?

103
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,810
Why are you having such thoughts?

104
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,480
Eun Chong took my room already.

105
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,880
I thought our baby could end up
becoming unwanted...

106
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,980
because of Eun Chong's presence.

107
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,720
That's crazy.
We'll be there as parents.

108
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,420
If this is too hard for you,
then go to our newlywed home.

109
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,960
Mom told me
to stick next to Eun Chong.

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,290
Your health comes first.

111
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
And we should
consider the baby, too.

112
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,900
I think Goo Ha Na is
using Eun Chong as an excuse...

113
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,270
to move back in
and get her revenge on me.

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,480
You can sleep next to me tonight,
and sleep with your auntie tomorrow.

115
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,020
I want to start tonight.

116
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,290
Yesterday was the last day
you slept peacefully...

117
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,250
with your grandson.

118
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,320
Don't get delusional and think
you can steal what I let you borrow.

119
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,530
Goodnight.

120
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,300
Goodnight.

121
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,570
Let's go.

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,050
Why is your blanket in here,
Eun Chong?

123
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,650
Have you been sleeping
in the wardrobe?

124
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,320
Why?

125
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,630
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

126
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,330
I can already tell without words.

127
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,300
He's the blood of your enemy!

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,570
But at the same time,
I raised him like my own with love.

129
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,180
Starting tonight,
you can sleep on the bed with me...

130
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,650
- instead of the wardrobe.
- Okay!

131
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,530
Eun Chong, was it hard
when you couldn't see me?

132
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,190
Yes.

133
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,000
I thought of you every day...

134
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,970
and came here every day
to meet you, too.

135
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,400
- Really?
- Yes.

136
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,640
I kept calling your name.
Didn't you hear me?

137
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,940
No.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,540
Why didn't you come in, Auntie?

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,450
Did Grandma
not open the door for you?

140
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,580
- No.
- She's so bad.

141
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,390
All I want is
for you to stay healthy and well...

142
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,690
even when you miss me.

143
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,100
It makes me sad to hear
that you're unwell.

144
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,840
Can we live together?

145
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,970
I lied when I said
I wanted to live with Grandma.

146
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,710
Why did you lie?

147
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,740
Because I heard
you were getting married.

148
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,950
Says who?

149
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,610
Grandma.

150
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,450
She said you couldn't marry...

151
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,150
if I went with you,

152
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,050
and she said...

153
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,620
she could all live together
after you get married.

154
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,090
Was that why you said
you'd live with her...

155
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,630
instead of me?

156
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,960
Yes.

157
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,230
I'm not marrying.

158
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,740
Did Grandma lie to me?

159
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,710
If you have questions for me,
you can ask me.

160
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
Don't listen to anyone else.

161
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay.

162
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,780
Grandma is so bad.

163
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,650
She must've wanted to live with you.

164
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,050
Above all, what you want is
the most important.

165
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,160
You have to be honest
when you share what you like...

166
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,290
and dislike.

167
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,430
Okay. I only need you, Auntie Ha Na.

168
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,770
Goodness, how adorable.

169
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,840
What part do you find adorable
about the baby?

170
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,210
It's not just a single part.
It's everything about the baby.

171
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,550
Little one,
grow up into a healthy child.

172
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,890
Are you that happy?

173
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,260
Thank you, Jin Goo.

174
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,590
- For what?
- Changing your mind.

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,130
Will I ever become
a good dad and a good husband?

176
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,300
Yes, it all depends
on your attitude.

177
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,640
You'll thank me later...

178
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,380
after you begin to raise your child
in your marriage.

179
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,510
Okay.

180
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,100
My baby, I'll do my best
to be a good dad from now on.

181
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,670
And to Eun Chong.

182
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,110
It's weird to hear you thank me
for Eun Chong's business.

183
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,610
You'll be his dad
once you adopt him,

184
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,980
so I guess it's not odd.

185
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,920
Ha Na was supposed to be his mom.

186
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,250
It seems as if I stole him from her.

187
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,000
Auntie Ha Na.

188
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,300
Auntie Ha Na went out to buy things
to decorate your room.

189
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,970
Auntie Ha Na.

190
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,910
- She'll be back soon.
- You're lying.

191
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,740
I'm lying?

192
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,540
You can't speak
to your grandma like that.

193
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,710
Where did Auntie Ha Na go
without me?

194
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,250
I'll call her
and tell her to come quickly.

195
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,820
You can play with me. Come here.

196
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,650
No! I'm going to find Auntie Ha Na.

197
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,420
She'll be back soon.

198
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,320
You're lying. You're a liar.

199
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,890
What do you mean, Eun Chong?

200
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,000
Why am I a liar?

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,300
Auntie Ha Na said
she wasn't marrying.

202
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,230
You're a liar. You're really bad!

203
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,940
Eun Chong.

204
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,510
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Hey.

205
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,240
You didn't leave me here
and go, did you?

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,150
I made a quick trip
while you were asleep.

207
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,580
I'm a liar?

208
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,750
Goo Ha Na is
coming between Eun Chong and me.

209
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,490
You won't leave without me, right?

210
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,990
No.

211
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,900
Eun Chong, do you want to invite
your friends and throw a party...

212
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,300
once your room is all done?

213
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,370
- Do you want to do that?
- Yes!

214
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,110
I want to invite
Ji Soo and Tae Hoon.

215
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,240
- Yes, and some friends from school.
- Okay.

216
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,290
Ji Soo, this is for you.

217
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,290
Gosh, thank you.

218
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,090
What about me, Eun Chong?

219
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,690
Here.

220
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,830
What do you think?

221
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,000
Eun Chong's friends are
all cool and pretty.

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,110
Do you all want cake now?

223
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,410
- Yes!
- Yes!

224
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,780
Guys, do you want cola?

225
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,180
- Yes! I want lemon soda.
- Yes!

226
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,250
Okay.

227
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,850
Eun Chong, who's your mommy?

228
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,290
- I'm Eun Chong's...
- Auntie Ha Na is my mommy.

229
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,490
Yes, I'm Eun Chong's mom.

230
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,600
Guys, I'm Eun Chong's mom.

231
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,170
Eun Chong, who's your mommy?

232
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,470
It's Auntie Ha Na.

233
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,470
Eun Chong, I'm going to adopt you.

234
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,480
That means I'm your mom,
not Auntie Ha Na.

235
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,710
I want Auntie Ha Na to be my mommy.

236
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,420
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Auntie Ha Na!

237
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,390
Yes, I'll be Eun Chong's mom.

238
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,360
Do you want to play board games
after we eat?

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,660
- Okay!
- Okay!

240
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,840
How dare she
call herself his mother?

241
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,710
She came here
to keep Eun Chong to herself,

242
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,980
cut him off from us,

243
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,110
and take him from us.

244
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,380
Yeo Jin, will you let her do this?

245
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,620
She'll control Eun Chong
to come between him and us.

246
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,490
It has already begun.
I've already become a liar.

247
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,260
See?

248
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,660
If I'm a liar, she's a con artist.

249
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,230
It'd be a relief
if it ended at that.

250
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,270
Who knows
what more she'll say about you?

251
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,470
The corporate raiding...

252
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,070
Watch what you say.

253
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,170
Okay.

254
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,210
If you take
that brat's side once again,

255
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,350
I may just spill everything.

256
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,420
You know I'll adopt Eun Chong.

257
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,720
Why did you pretend to be his mom?

258
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,360
If he gets it wrong,
you have to make him...

259
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,690
understand what is right so he
and his friends don't get confused.

260
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,030
- Is that important?
- How is it not important?

261
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,300
The kids were more confused
when you fixed it right away.

262
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,040
Eun Chong said I was his mom.

263
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,700
He must've felt disconcerted...

264
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,870
in front of his friends
when you stepped up as his mom.

265
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,610
You're using Eun Chong's depression
only as an excuse.

266
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,080
What's your real intention?

267
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,780
What do you think it is?

268
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,450
Do you want to be Eun Chong's mom?

269
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,650
Why not?

270
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,290
I probably qualify
much more than you do.

271
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,670
She's showing
her true colors so clearly.

272
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,970
I'll be your mommy from now on,
and your daddy is Mr. Hwang.

273
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,540
- No.
- Why not?

274
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,340
You'll have a younger sibling,
and it'll be great.

275
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,980
I want Auntie Ha Na to be my mommy.

276
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,050
You're eight,
so you're old enough to understand.

277
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,650
You can't be this stubborn.

278
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,950
You have to follow
your elders' decisions.

279
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,120
- No.
- Say yes.

280
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,520
Where did you learn
to speak like a bad boy?

281
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,690
Did Auntie Ha Na
tell you to do this?

282
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,660
She told me to be honest...

283
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,330
about the things
I liked and disliked.

284
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,500
Call me mommy from now on.

285
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,500
- No.
- Just do it.

286
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,270
Why are you crying? Stop crying.

287
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,770
Stop crying, Eun Chong.

288
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,480
Why are you crying, Eun Chong?

289
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,610
I want to go to Auntie Ha Na.

290
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,550
I said I was his mother,
not Goo Ha Na,

291
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,090
but he rejected me and cried.

292
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,630
If he doesn't like it,
don't force it on him.

293
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,260
From now on, I'm his mother,
and Jin Goo is his father.

294
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,530
You have to tell him that.

295
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,260
What's the rush?

296
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,330
He'll catch on in time.

297
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,900
You keep causing trouble...

298
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,100
Let Eun Chong do it
when he's comfortable enough.

299
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,810
Aunt Yeo Jin.

300
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,370
You can go, Se Young.

301
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,050
You need to stop crossing the line.

302
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,390
How dare you pretend to be his mom
when Se Young is here?

303
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,620
"Pretend?"

304
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,190
I raised Eun Chong for six years
since infancy after Du Na died.

305
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,830
What makes me
less of a mother than Se Young?

306
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,030
What right does she have
to pretend to be his mom?

307
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,270
Eun Chong and Se Young are
each other's only blood...

308
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,740
and the closest relatives.

309
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,610
That bloodline?

310
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,340
People who have
never changed his diaper,

311
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,140
never fed him formula,

312
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,980
and never spent the night up
trying to put him to sleep...

313
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,820
must love to talk about his blood.

314
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,850
- Watch what you say.
- But I have bad news.

315
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,090
Eun Chong doesn't know or care
about what or who his blood is.

316
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,860
So stop going on a power trip...

317
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,160
over his blood
and your money with me...

318
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,930
because it all sounds like a joke.

319
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,970
Are you here
to steal Eun Chong from us?

320
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,470
I'm here to treat him
for his depression.

321
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,680
Your aunt took
Goo Ha Na's side again?

322
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,550
She told me
to give Eun Chong more time...

323
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,220
until he wanted to call me mom,
just as Goo Ha Na wanted.

324
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,820
What? What's with her?

325
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,360
I can't let this go on.

326
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,790
Let's register your marriage first.

327
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,130
Jin Goo won't budge.

328
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,230
I can convince Bang Ul
and sign the paperwork...

329
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,600
without him finding out.

330
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,780
Hey, Yeo Jin.

331
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,710
Okay.

332
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,050
Yeo Jin wants to see us.

333
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,920
But I have bad news.

334
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,190
Eun Chong doesn't know or care...

335
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,590
about what or who his blood is.

336
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,790
So stop going on
a power trip with me...

337
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,300
over his blood and your money...

338
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,060
because it all sounds like a joke.

339
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,170
Fine, let's wait and see
how far you take this.

340
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,010
Come in.

341
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,840
Have a seat.

342
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,110
- Okay.
- Yes.

343
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,580
Se Young, you can register
your marriage with Jin Goo first...

344
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,420
and start the adoption process.

345
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,120
That's a wonderful decision,
Yeo Jin.

346
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,660
Yes, I'll do that, Aunt Yeo Jin.

347
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,600
Jin Goo will say no,
so I'll pass on him.

348
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,270
I'll convince Bang Ul instead
to sign their marriage.

349
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,770
If you can't convince her,

350
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,140
you and I can be the witness
and move this forward.

351
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,470
Okay.

352
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,780
You now know
what Goo Ha Na is up to, right?

353
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,740
Tell Ms. Jang to come in.

354
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,350
- Okay.
- Okay.

355
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,510
Let's go.

356
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,520
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

357
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,630
I'm investing more
in Goo Ha Na's siblings.

358
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,760
Get the contracts ready.

359
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,860
- Did they demand more?
- No.

360
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,770
I need something
to put pressure on her...

361
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,510
to pull Eun Chong away from her
in the future.

362
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,110
If she takes advantage of Eun Chong,

363
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,640
I'll take advantage of her siblings.

364
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,910
What a busy day.

365
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,780
I have your delicious tteokbokki.

366
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,290
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

367
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,820
This is my brother's place.

368
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,790
It was certified as a delicious place
in the neighborhood,

369
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,660
so he got that sign, too.

370
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,360
This place is so popular.

371
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,600
- What's the secret?
- If you're curious, start one, too.

372
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,730
- Next, please.
- Okay.

373
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,300
- You're here.
- Hey.

374
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,240
Would you like to order?

375
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,240
We'll take
a serving of tteokbokki...

376
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,450
and your best fritters.

377
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,020
Aren't tteokbokki and fritters
a match made in heaven?

378
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,430
Yes, the wait was worth it.

379
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,060
What? Please excuse me.

380
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,700
Hello?

381
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,930
Yes, hello, Ms. Jang.

382
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,970
Yes, I've been thriving
thanks to you.

383
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,040
More investment?

384
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,850
The baby's
baby bump nickname is Star?

385
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,820
Yes, Jin Goo and I
named the baby together.

386
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,850
He cried after hearing
the baby's heartbeat.

387
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,520
Did he?

388
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,160
So, let's register their marriage...

389
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,630
for Star's sake.

390
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,530
Goo Ha Na gets Hyesung Group
if she steals Eun Chong from us.

391
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,840
Are you going to sit on your hands?

392
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,270
Why do you worry about something
that isn't even happening?

393
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,310
It'll be too late once it happens.

394
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,680
She was filled with spite
when she moved in.

395
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,720
Even the chairwoman told us...

396
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,190
to register the marriage first...

397
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,790
and start the adoption process.

398
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,530
Mother, I lost my room
to Ha Na, too.

399
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,930
I feel so miserable.

400
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,760
Wouldn't it be great...

401
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,930
for my Star to have
an older brother like Eun Chong?

402
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,370
If we lose Eun Chong,

403
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,810
then Jin Goo, our baby, and I...

404
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,510
will end up with nothing.

405
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,710
Honestly speaking,
Se Young is letting go...

406
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,150
of how Jin Goo was into Ha Na...

407
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,050
because of her love
for Jin Goo and the baby.

408
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,690
Bang Ul, just focus on...

409
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,460
your grandchild in Se Young's womb.

410
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,530
You can do that much
for your grandchild as a grandma.

411
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,510
Do you just need his ID and seal?

412
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,980
You got in touch
with the nun in Canada?

413
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,580
Yes, let me know the date
when she books the return flight.

414
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,490
And make sure...

415
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,520
the director nun doesn't find
any information about me. Bye.

416
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,110
Yu Jin, I will find out...

417
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,780
who ended your life like that.

418
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,520
If for nothing else,
I'll do it for Eun Chong.

419
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,570
Bang Ul was convinced.

420
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,610
We'll register the marriage
without Jin Goo finding out.

421
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,680
We need to finish
the adoption process...

422
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,980
to bring peace
to Eun Chong and this family.

423
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,120
And that way,
Goo Ha Na will stop acting up, too.

424
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,590
That's right.
We must nip this in the bud.

425
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,930
Hey, I think they'll register
Se Young's marriage first...

426
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,830
to adopt Eun Chong.

427
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,300
How did you know?

428
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,070
I overheard Se Young's mom
and Chairwoman Shin talking.

429
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,940
Nothing seemed scheduled,
but they were set on it.

430
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,170
We need to stop them.

431
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,340
We have to find out
when they'll register.

432
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,780
It'll probably be a weekday,
so check Se Young's schedule.

433
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,880
What are all these?

434
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,980
Se Young brought all these
wild ginseng gift sets...

435
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,790
and health supplements.

436
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,220
You'll have two kids
after you adopt Eun Chong,

437
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,330
so it'll take a toll on Se Young.

438
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,460
We'll hire help.

439
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,430
Are you okay with having Eun Chong
as your grandson?

440
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,070
I'm happy
as long as you two are happy.

441
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,640
Anyway, I hear
Eun Chong's aunt is...

442
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,310
acting like his mother.

443
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,210
She called his friends
and said she was his mom.

444
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,810
She made the chairwoman mad
because of that.

445
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,120
Really?

446
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,290
This is probably because
Eun Chong wants her to be his mom.

447
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,190
While we're on the subject,

448
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,590
isn't it better
to register your marriage first...

449
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,660
to adopt Eun Chong?

450
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,930
Was Se Young here to discuss that?

451
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,400
- I heard the chairwoman wanted it.
- The chairwoman?

452
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,470
I'll have the wedding,
register my marriage,

453
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,210
and then adopt him.

454
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,340
Is that so?

455
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,350
Goo Ha Na moved in
to steal Eun Chong, didn't she?

456
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,350
He's the chairwoman's grandson.

457
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
How is she going to do that?

458
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,190
Everyone in this world knows that,
but it's just her who's clueless.

459
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,650
She's deep into playing his mom,

460
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,460
only trusting that
Eun Chong is on her side.

461
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,790
Why do you care so much?

462
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,830
She outright provokes me to my face.

463
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,130
I'm leaving early today.

464
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,070
Why? Is something going on?

465
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,870
One moment.

466
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,110
Hey, Mom.

467
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,380
Mother will also come
to the borough office at 2 p.m.?

468
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,080
I'll go there straight from work.

469
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,450
Okay. Bye.

470
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,520
Why are you going
to the borough office?

471
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,860
To do something.

472
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,820
Bye.

473
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,970
Ha Na, Se Young is
going to the borough office.

474
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,840
I think she's going there
to register her marriage.

475
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,910
Today at 2 p.m.?

476
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,880
What time is it now?

477
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,780
It's 12 p.m.

478
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,820
We have to stop them.

479
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,390
Do you have an idea?

480
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,790
Ji Seok.

481
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,690
I'm sorry, but I need to use you.

482
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,710
Yoon Se Young is cheating.

483
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,810
Your son found out and tried
to call the engagement off.

484
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,810
However, he is marrying her
because of the baby.

485
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,210
What is this saying?

486
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,450
Se Young is cheating on him?

487
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,680
Jin Goo found out about it...

488
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,520
and tried to call
the engagement off?

489
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,630
The chairwoman told them
to register my marriage first?

490
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,730
Is she trying
to rush the adoption...

491
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,030
because she thinks
Ha Na wants to take Eun Chong?

492
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,370
Chairwoman Shin wanted
to make me appear schizophrenic...

493
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,410
and planned to lock me up
at a mental institution.

494
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,040
Is she trying to make
Ha Na's life difficult again?

495
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,280
Mother is coming to our place?

496
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,680
- Why?
- I have no idea.

497
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,020
Come home.
We can all go there together.

498
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,090
Okay.

499
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,520
What's going on?

500
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,330
Where are you going?

501
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,470
- I'm leaving early today.
- Is something going on?

502
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,000
Mom and I are
going shopping for baby products.

503
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,240
Is that so?

504
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,040
Did you ask my mom
to register our marriage first?

505
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,010
Aunt Yeo Jin told me to ask.

506
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,350
She said no
because you were against it.

507
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,880
Bye, then.

508
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,630
Why? Is something going on?

509
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,830
Where's Se Young?

510
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,370
Upstairs.

511
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,010
You're here, Mother.

512
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,150
Is something going on?

513
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,520
Be honest.

514
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,320
About what?

515
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,950
Are you seeing another man?

516
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,730
What are you talking about?

517
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,630
Answer me.
Are you seeing another man?

518
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,360
No, Mother.

519
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,730
There's no man other than Jin Goo.

520
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,670
He wanted to call off the engagement
because you had another man, right?

521
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,440
No, Mother.

522
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,310
Where did you hear this absurdity
to come and harass her?

523
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,710
Then, why did he
want to call it off?

524
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,310
I told you already.
He said he didn't love me.

525
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,920
Why would you blame me
for how his feelings changed?

526
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,280
He doesn't change his mind
that frivolously.

527
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,690
But he must've changed his mind
because you had another man!

528
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,060
What about his feelings for Ha Na?

529
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,920
He was the one who cheated on her!

530
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,700
Who knows what
he has done with Goo Ha Na?

531
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,370
Did you have evidence
that I cheated on him?

532
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,600
If you do, show me.

533
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,840
I got...

534
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,080
this text message.

535
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,080
(Yoon Se Young is cheating.)

536
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,050
This is just slander.

537
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,990
- Who sent this to you?
- I don't know.

538
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,630
Are you slandering Se Young
with a text message...

539
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,390
sent to you from a random person?

540
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,260
"Slandering?"

541
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,070
This can't be used as evidence!

542
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,200
What if someone sent it to you
to hurt her?

543
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,640
I'll ask Jin Goo.

544
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,340
He doesn't know, Mother.

545
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,450
I never cheated on him,
so there would be no evidence.

546
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,650
Please don't be fooled
by something this ridiculous.

547
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,520
Did you rush over in anger
because of that stupid message?

548
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,390
My goodness. I thought you had
some profound evidence.

549
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,860
There's no evidence,

550
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,030
but there's a witness.

551
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,970
- What?
- "A witness?"

552
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,470
I know...

553
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,400
the man Se Young is seeing.

554
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,300
(Cinderella Game)

555
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,730
- Who sent her that message?
- I think it's Ha Na.

556
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,170
You don't have evidence
that it's her.

557
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,070
- Are you her spokesperson?
- You can call this marriage off.

558
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,070
If you can't raise the baby, I will.

559
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,180
- Why don't you use Hwang Jin Goo?
- Hwang Jin Goo?

560
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,580
I warned you not to cross the line.
Are you ignoring me?

561
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,210
- Make sure you do your math right.
- Goodness.

562
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,180
You'd know better as a corporate raider,
Ms. Chairwoman.

563
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,250
Do you want to be Eun Chong's mom?

564
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,690
If I say yes, will you help me?

565
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,160
Can you take my side?
