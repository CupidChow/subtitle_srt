1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,210
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,810
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,390
The doctor wants to see
Ms. Shin's guardian.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,620
Sure.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,400
Ms. Jang,
can you come to her hospital room?

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,150
How can you do this to me?

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,860
I served you for 20 years,
yet you didn't leave me a penny.

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,130
Well, you leave me no choice.

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,040
I must take your grandson,

11
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,070
whom you love so dearly.

12
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,640
So, it's time for you to go.

13
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,710
You'd be better off
by your beloved daughter's side...

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,650
than being stuck here
on the hospital bed.

15
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,930
But you know, we've been through
thick and thin together,

16
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,200
so let me help you take
that one last breath.

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,890
You brought this upon yourself.

18
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,290
Farewell.

19
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,220
Se Young's mom?

20
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,910
How may I help you?

21
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,240
The patient is off the respirator!
Please come quickly!

22
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,410
Oh, no.

23
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,050
Is Grandma sick?

24
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,950
What?

25
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,460
- She's back on the respirator.
- Get me epinephrine.

26
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,490
Yes, Doctor.

27
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,590
Let's go, Eun Chong.

28
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,900
What's going on?

29
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,210
Is Grandma really sick?

30
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,890
Why are you out here?

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,860
- She had a cardiac arrest.
- What?

32
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,610
Her heart rate is back to normal.
She turned the corner.

33
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,010
We'll watch her closely
for the next few hours.

34
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,580
What suddenly happened?

35
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,120
We received a call that
she was off the respirator.

36
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,620
The respirator?

37
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,820
Is that even possible?

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,200
Yeo Jin must've died.

39
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,070
There should be
a huge ruckus by now.

40
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,700
Why hasn't the nurse reached out?

41
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,780
Hello?

42
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,750
Ms. Shin Yeo Jin
had gone into cardiac arrest.

43
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,760
Is Yeo Jin all right?

44
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,390
Thankfully, she was found soon
and turned the corner.

45
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,860
She turned the corner?

46
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,700
So, is she okay?

47
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm glad.

48
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm glad.

49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,210
Okay.

50
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,190
You're harder to get rid of
than I expected, Yeo Jin.

51
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,390
Who found out?

52
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,760
Her respirator had come off
by the time I got here,

53
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,800
so I called the doctor in a hurry.

54
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
How did it come off?

55
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,740
There could be many reasons,
such as machine malfunction,

56
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,370
outside contact, and more.

57
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,310
They'll have to investigate
and find out the accurate reason.

58
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,180
Someone could've come in
when the room was empty.

59
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,780
I was waiting
in front of the doctor's office.

60
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,380
Ms. Jang,
did you not come right away?

61
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,650
I stopped by the administration
to get paperwork...

62
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,090
for your legal guardianship.

63
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,590
It took only a few minutes,

64
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,820
but someone could've come in here.

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,090
They can't find out because there's
no CCTV in the hospital rooms.

66
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,170
She lived thanks to you, Ha Na.
Thank you.

67
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm glad she's fine.

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,010
Eun Chong, come here.

69
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,980
Is Grandma okay now?

70
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes.

71
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,890
Wait, before I got here,

72
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,220
I saw Se Young's mom in the lobby.

73
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,520
She was leaving in haste.

74
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,630
Then, could Choi Myung Ji
have done this?

75
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,330
Let's check
hospital CCTV footage first.

76
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,200
Please stay here
for a moment, Ha Na.

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,330
Okay.

78
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,240
This is footage of the corridor...

79
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,980
between 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.
on the day of the incident.

80
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,650
No one left the room,
and only these two walked inside.

81
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,220
She was the one who pressed
the emergency button.

82
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,860
There's no trace
of Choi Myung Ji here.

83
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,660
Is it possible
not to get caught on camera?

84
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,130
It's possible
if she only traveled through blind spots.

85
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,830
Can we check the CCTV footage
in the lobby around this hour?

86
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,030
Sure.

87
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,840
There it is.

88
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,180
Yes, she was seen in the lobby
just as Ha Na said.

89
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,380
We can't use it as evidence
if she wasn't seen going into the room.

90
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,300
I'll be fine if there's no evidence
that I was in her hospital room.

91
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,030
I'm glad I checked
the blind spots beforehand.

92
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,600
But Sung Ho will
continue to be suspicious of me,

93
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,370
as well as Jang.

94
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,040
- Mom.
- You surprised me.

95
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,050
Why are you so surprised?

96
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,280
- Is something going on?
- No.

97
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,750
Did you handle your embezzlement?

98
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,490
The case will be held off
while Aunt Yeo Jin is unconscious.

99
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,690
I met with the board,
and they said they'd demand...

100
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,730
the million dollars from her.

101
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,390
Good.

102
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,560
Then, Eun Chong is our only problem.

103
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,630
Are you going to bring him home?

104
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,300
Can we manage his assets...

105
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,670
once we become his legal guardians?

106
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,110
Of course.

107
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,610
No one will get a say
even if we bring him home,

108
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,650
not even Sung Ho.

109
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,250
But wouldn't he also want to be
Eun Chong's legal guardian?

110
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,950
Maybe he made the request already.

111
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,920
That never crossed my mind.

112
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,160
- I need to check.
- Do it quickly.

113
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,390
If you fight Uncle Sung Ho,
he'll win as Eun Chong's granddad.

114
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,630
Attorney Lee, I want to become
the legal guardian of a minor...

115
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,370
because the original guardian
went unconscious. How long will it take?

116
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,740
I want it done as soon as possible.

117
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,270
Okay. I'll get the files ready
and send them over.

118
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,240
Can you also find out...

119
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,750
if anyone else has filed
to become the kid's guardian?

120
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,690
There's no hard evidence
if she wasn't caught by the CCTV.

121
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,330
No.

122
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,990
Choi Myung Ji is the suspect...

123
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,130
in the chairwoman's coma,
the detached respirator,

124
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,530
and even the hit-and-run accident.

125
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,340
The suspicion grows deeper,
but there's zero evidence.

126
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,010
And the chairwoman owes you
yet another one.

127
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,710
- What do you mean?
- What? You saved her life.

128
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm glad I found her quickly.

129
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,920
Right. Mr. Han filed to become
Eun Chong's legal guardian.

130
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,790
I'm glad.

131
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,390
He should act as his guardian...

132
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,790
if the chairwoman
continues to stay in her coma.

133
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,230
We're here already.

134
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,930
This is when I find it disappointing
that we live so close by.

135
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,340
We'll meet tomorrow anyway.

136
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,670
Go in and get some rest.

137
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,940
You have to return to work
starting tomorrow.

138
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,940
Okay.

139
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,780
Let's not make
our relationship public at work.

140
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,150
If I can, I want to tell
the whole world about us.

141
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,350
- She's my woman!
- My gosh.

142
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,560
What if someone hears you?

143
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,190
I wanted people to hear me.

144
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm happy to think we'll meet every day
starting tomorrow.

145
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,500
Me, too.

146
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,570
- The CCTV from the house across?
- Yes.

147
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,040
I just received the video file.
She called a locksmith...

148
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,680
and forced the door open.

149
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,020
Take a look.

150
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,690
Myung Ji lied.

151
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,390
Yes, the chairwoman
never reconciled with her,

152
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,130
and she
didn't open the door, either.

153
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,230
I'm also suspicious
about the respirator coming off.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,530
Why don't we put her on a ban
from coming to the hospital?

155
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,970
The hospital lists her
as the chairwoman's guardian,

156
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,370
so I don't know if that's possible.

157
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,480
I have zero rights,
although I'm her husband,

158
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,420
and the same applies to Eun Chong.

159
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,720
But you'll become
Eun Chong's legal guardian.

160
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,560
A man named Yoon Sung Ho filed
to become Eun Chong's guardian?

161
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,630
What can I do, then?

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,600
I need to do whatever I can.

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,110
Cardiac arrest?

164
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,740
Is she all right?

165
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,880
Wait, why didn't you
reach out to me?

166
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm her guardian!

167
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,150
Someone could've taken off
her respirator intentionally.

168
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,850
"Intentionally?"

169
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,760
- Who?
- Someone who can't let her wake up.

170
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,400
Do you know who it might be?

171
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,030
I honestly can't trust you,
Myung Ji.

172
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,040
Wait, are you suspicious of me?

173
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,410
No one...

174
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,780
No one wishes her to wake up
more than I do.

175
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,280
Who else will you trust
if you can't trust me?

176
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,220
We're investigating the reason why
the respirator came off. Please go.

177
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,520
This is so frustrating.

178
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,760
No, I can't trust you, either.

179
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,000
- I'm her family!
- Do not dare say...

180
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,900
you're her family.

181
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm her guardian from now on.

182
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,610
So, do not come here
without permission.

183
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,040
You don't need to come here.

184
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,410
I won't sit on my hands...

185
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,380
if you keep acting like this.

186
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,490
Excuse me, are you Mr. Yoon Sung Ho?

187
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,690
- Yes.
- We're the police.

188
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,900
You're arrested
for the attempted murder of Shin Yeo Jin.

189
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,030
"Attempted murder?"

190
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,370
No, why am I under such suspicion?

191
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,840
I'll explain it in detail
in the interrogation room.

192
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,910
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

193
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,780
and choose to remain silent.

194
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,680
No, it wasn't me.

195
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,380
Take him away.

196
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,490
Yeo Jin.

197
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,400
So, why didn't you just pass away?

198
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,800
Why did you come back
only to send your husband to prison?

199
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,880
Did you see Sung Ho
taken away by the police?

200
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,980
Yes, how can this happen?

201
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,250
They'll investigate and find out.

202
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,520
I heard
she had a cardiac arrest yesterday.

203
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,560
Why didn't you call me?

204
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,830
I'm back here at work
because of you.

205
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,960
I couldn't even take a break.

206
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,960
Why me?

207
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,870
You said
you'd bring Hyesung Tour back...

208
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,500
if the mother-daughter
therapy tour became a success.

209
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,370
You don't have to do this.
Just chill.

210
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,210
I'm going to chill
after bringing Hyesung Tour back.

211
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,110
Right. I wanted to ask
Mr. Han to move out,

212
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,580
but Chairwoman Shin had
a cardiac arrest, so I couldn't.

213
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,020
I'll find a chance to ask him.

214
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,050
She must be in awful condition.

215
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,390
Her respirator had come off.

216
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,860
How did that come off?

217
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,760
The hospital said
they'd investigate.

218
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,560
But everyone is suspicious
of Choi Myung Ji, including Mr. Han,

219
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,030
although there's no evidence.

220
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,770
I also think it was her.

221
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,410
These suspicions mean nothing.
We need to find the evidence.

222
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,610
Se Young framed the chairwoman
for her embezzlement in this situation.

223
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,010
Her mom must've put her up to it.

224
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,850
I suspended that case.

225
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,520
- Chairman Goo, it's Mr. Han.
- What's wrong?

226
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,690
He was arrested without a warrant
for attempted murder.

227
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,260
- "Attempted murder?"
- "Attempted murder?"

228
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,370
There was an anonymous report
that he took off the respirator?

229
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,770
That's crazy. Is there evidence?

230
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,270
All right.

231
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,310
What's going on?

232
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,620
Did you know?

233
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,320
I was there when he got arrested.

234
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,850
It was too shocking.

235
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,760
Do you really think
Uncle Sung Ho would do that?

236
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,060
I heard the report was
made anonymously.

237
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,690
I'm sure they had evidence
if they took him away.

238
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,230
Probably.

239
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,470
I have to be there as a testifier.
It's scary.

240
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,900
Go ahead and try to stop me.

241
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,010
I won't let anyone stand in my way.

242
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,640
Are you also suspicious
of Choi Myung Ji as the reporter?

243
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,980
A random person
wouldn't make an anonymous report.

244
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,280
She took Chairwoman Shin
off the respirator, failed to kill her,

245
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,650
then framed Mr. Han for it?

246
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,120
What does she get...

247
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,390
when he's out of the picture?

248
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,500
If Chairwoman Shin
continues to stay in her coma,

249
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,400
Choi Myung Ji will
act as her guardian...

250
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,630
and Eun Chong's legal guardian.

251
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,100
Then, Hyesung falls
into Se Young and her mom's hands.

252
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,180
Mr. Han made a request to become
Eun Chong's legal guardian.

253
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
This won't cause
any problems, will it?

254
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,280
There's no evidence,
so he'll be freed.

255
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,490
Shouldn't you go
to the police station?

256
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,630
Hey, Ji Chang.

257
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,370
- Ha Na.
- What's wrong?

258
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,670
Mr. Han was arrested
for attempted murder.

259
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,470
So, detectives came
to search his room.

260
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,580
They also had questions for me,
so they told me to wait.

261
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,410
I'm so scared, Ha Na.

262
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,710
Can you come home now?

263
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,880
I'll be there now, so stay calm.
Don't be scared.

264
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,850
Bye.

265
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,360
- What is it?
- The police are searching his room.

266
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,690
Ji Chang is completely frightened.

267
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,160
I need to go home.

268
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,230
- I'll go with you.
- You'll come, too?

269
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm the head of our family now.
I should go.

270
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,370
My gosh.

271
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,270
- Ji Seok.
- Ha Na.

272
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,670
Did the detectives leave?

273
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,910
- Yes.
- What did they ask you?

274
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,850
If we knew
he had faked his identity,

275
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,280
that he was staying here illegally,

276
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,380
and if he showed
any suspicious behaviors.

277
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,490
I was really scared.

278
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,960
- Did he really try to kill someone?
- No.

279
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,860
He was framed.

280
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,460
You're right. He wouldn't do that.

281
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,400
Anyway, but I found it suspicious
that he was away for a few days.

282
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,030
You said it was a woman.

283
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,400
Wait, did that woman almost die?

284
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,510
- You're crazy.
- I must be right!

285
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,780
- Think before you speak.
- It must be true.

286
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,760
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

287
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,020
Why should you do that?

288
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,390
Stop touching the things that
belong to an attempted murderer.

289
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,390
- Stop it.
- Come on.

290
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,260
He's presumed innocent
until he's proven guilty.

291
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,100
He was framed.

292
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,370
Can we really believe that?

293
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,350
Anyway, why is this in his room?

294
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,520
Actually, he's...

295
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,360
Eun Chong's grandfather.

296
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,060
What? What are you talking about?

297
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,030
Wait, he's actually
Eun Chong's grandfather?

298
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes, on his mother's side.

299
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,870
He's Du Na's father.

300
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,300
No way.

301
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,570
So, he's Chairwoman Shin's husband?

302
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,970
Wait, so we got
her husband's help...

303
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,010
to get revenge on her?

304
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,510
- Did you know?
- I found out recently.

305
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,350
Jeez.

306
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,060
Hello? You've reached Goo Ji Seok.

307
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,660
Questioning as a testifier?

308
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,860
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,300
I don't really have much to say.

310
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,640
Hello? Yes.

311
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,310
Okay.

312
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,380
I was summoned as a testifier, too.

313
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,400
Someone saw you taking
the respirator off of Ms. Shin.

314
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,330
I never did that,
so how could anyone see me?

315
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,370
I'm getting framed.

316
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,440
You entered the country...

317
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,510
under a fake identity as Han Min Su,
also known as Richard Han.

318
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,810
On top of that, we have evidence
that you helped Mr. Goo Ji Seok,

319
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,010
who wanted to get revenge
on Ms. Shin.

320
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,920
I had a reason for doing that.

321
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,120
Mr. Goo Ji Seok refused
to come as a testifier.

322
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,700
I am Mr. Yoon Sung Ho's
legal representative.

323
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,030
- I am his secretary.
- I see.

324
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,700
May I have a minute
with my attorney?

325
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,210
He says there was a witness account.

326
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,910
Someone made a false testimony
to slander me.

327
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,680
Are you suspicious of anyone?

328
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,120
I told the detective that
I was suspicious of Choi Myung Ji,

329
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,120
but he thought I brought her in
just to walk free.

330
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,490
It's hard to arrest her
without hard evidence.

331
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,290
The easiest way to get her involved
would be finding the evidence...

332
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,230
of the hit-and-run accident.

333
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,470
Was she behind
the hit-and-run accident, too?

334
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,910
(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

335
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,620
Have a seat.

336
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,030
Ha Na went to the questioning
as a testifier.

337
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,360
- Won't you go, Chairman Goo?
- No.

338
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,300
Mr. Yoon is getting framed.

339
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,340
Wouldn't it help the investigation
if you gave a testimony?

340
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,240
Let's get back to work.

341
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,410
This is the proposal...

342
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,940
for the promotional mother-daughter
therapy tour for our hotel guests.

343
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,280
I'll look over it.

344
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,620
Come in.

345
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,790
I just met with Mr. Yoon.

346
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,230
You seem curious. Stay and listen.

347
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,340
There's more focus on his identity
fraud than attempted murder?

348
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,810
Yes, his illegal stay and revenge
against Chairwoman Shin...

349
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,040
seem to have
a negative impact on him.

350
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,480
Did he mention he was
suspicious of Choi Myung Ji?

351
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,950
Yes, but they wouldn't hear him.

352
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,780
A reinvestigation
of the hit-and-run accident...

353
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,320
seems to be the only key
to catch her.

354
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,290
There's new video evidence,
so it may be possible, right?

355
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,590
- I agree.
- Yes.

356
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,490
I'll meet him and let him know.

357
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,830
(Video Interrogation Room A)

358
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,340
Are you here as a testifier, too?

359
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,580
Yes.

360
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,810
What did they ask you?

361
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,750
About the moment I witnessed her
without the respirator.

362
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,020
- You found her like that?
- Yes.

363
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,690
It was you.

364
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,090
You ruined my plan.

365
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,730
Thank you.

366
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,600
You saved Yeo Jin.

367
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,900
I saw you at the hospital yesterday.

368
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,840
- Me?
- You seemed to leave in haste.

369
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,710
Did something happen?

370
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,820
Yes, I had to be somewhere.

371
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,390
I think you're the culprit,

372
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,520
but there's no evidence.

373
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,620
So what if you saw me?

374
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,090
Do you have evidence
I took the respirator off her?

375
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,330
Why did you do that...

376
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,940
to Du Na? No.

377
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,100
Why did you do that to Yu Jin?

378
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,140
What do you mean?

379
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,380
You knew she was
at St. Paul's Home...

380
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,480
- when she was ten.
- What?

381
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,520
You also knew she got adopted
and emigrated to America.

382
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,220
What are you talking about?

383
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,620
If you knew she went to America,

384
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,290
you would've known
she came to Korea seven years ago.

385
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,390
You probably kept an eye on her.

386
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,800
Back then, Du Na thought
she found her mom's home...

387
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,870
and said she'd meet the landlady,

388
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,670
but she got into the accident
on that day,

389
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,770
a hit-and-run accident.

390
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,970
So?

391
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,610
Talk to me if you know something.

392
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,710
Chairwoman Shin will die in peace
after we catch the culprit...

393
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,850
for that accident.

394
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,950
Why would she die?

395
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,850
Are you trying to curse her?

396
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,320
Stop changing the subject.

397
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,660
Do you really not know
about the hit-and-run accident?

398
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,590
No, I don't!

399
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,660
Stop blaming the innocent!

400
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,160
You should've asked
if I had the evidence.

401
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,630
That was disappointing.

402
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,200
Sure.

403
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,880
Do you have evidence?

404
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,020
If she knows,
everyone else must know, too.

405
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,820
It's okay
as long as Yeo Jin is in a coma.

406
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,220
I'll be Eun Chong's guardian
before that happens.

407
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,800
Hey, Jin Goo.

408
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,940
I just got out.

409
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,380
Right now?

410
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,280
- He was detained?
- Yes.

411
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,420
They must've thought he could flee
or destroy the evidence...

412
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,090
with his history of illegal stay
and identity fraud.

413
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,750
Won't you visit him?

414
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,090
How can they detain him
without any evidence?

415
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,400
It's the worst-case scenario.

416
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,770
It'll take him a while
to become Eun Chong's guardian.

417
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,070
Yes.

418
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,340
I'm worried about Choi Myung Ji.

419
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,480
On that note, why don't we
reopen the hit-and-run case?

420
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,740
If we turn in the video
that shows the driver...

421
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,180
and the license plate
as new evidence,

422
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,710
they'll reopen the case.

423
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,080
Chairman Goo agreed.

424
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm all for it, too.

425
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,390
I met Choi Myung Ji on my way out,

426
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,560
and she was so brazen.

427
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,690
She needs to get a taste of the law.

428
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,830
What did she say?

429
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,230
I asked why she didn't tell anyone,

430
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,860
even though she knew
Yu Jin had moved to America,

431
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,800
and if she knew anything
about the hit-and-run accident.

432
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,000
What did she say?

433
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,700
She probably feigned ignorance.

434
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,810
She denied it,
but she couldn't hide it on her face.

435
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,840
She's good
at evading responsibility,

436
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
so she'll deny it
even with the evidence.

437
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,380
She might.

438
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,820
Let's go meet Mr. Yoon.

439
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,950
We'll tell him about the reinvestigation
and file the case.

440
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,160
Choi Myung Ji will find out
if the case reopens.

441
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,460
Then, there's a possibility
she'll destroy evidence...

442
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,500
and flee.

443
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,530
Despite that danger,
we think it's right to do this.

444
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,170
This is the only way
we can stop her.

445
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,510
We'll find the culprit
as soon as we catch the driver.

446
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,440
Yeo Jin would want this, too.
Let's do it.

447
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,910
Okay.

448
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,020
Eun Chong is at Mr. Hwang's place,
so he'll be fine.

449
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,520
Please keep
Yeo Jin's room safe, too.

450
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,790
Yes, but Ms. Jang said
the hospital refused...

451
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,390
to put her on a ban
because she was the guardian.

452
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm worried.

453
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,170
We should hire more security guards.

454
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,130
Reopening the hit-and-run case?

455
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,040
Who made the request?
Sung Ho is behind bars!

456
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,840
Hwang Jin Goo and Goo Ha Na...

457
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,940
turned in CCTV footage
as new evidence.

458
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,080
Hwang Jin Goo and Goo Ha Na.

459
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,590
What's the new evidence?

460
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,960
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

461
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,790
- Did the questioning go okay?
- Yes.

462
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,300
I heard Uncle Sung Ho got detained.

463
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,730
Hwang Jin Goo and Goo Ha Na
look so miserable.

464
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,510
You should eat dinner
with Eun Chong tonight.

465
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,940
Tonight?

466
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,740
I'll be his legal guardian soon.

467
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,710
- I bribed the judge.
- You did?

468
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,280
You should get closer to him
over dinner.

469
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,020
Okay.

470
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,320
- Eun Chong, take your time to eat.
- Okay.

471
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,930
Anyway, what brings you here
without a call?

472
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,270
I missed Eun Chong.

473
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,670
I'm his only blood relation
apart from his grandparents.

474
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,540
I should take good care of him.

475
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,740
Right, have you heard?

476
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,610
Eun Chong's grandfather was
arrested by the police.

477
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,720
Why?

478
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,250
Grandpa was arrested by the police?

479
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,720
No, he wasn't.

480
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,860
He tried to kill my aunt
by taking the respirator off.

481
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,930
What is this nonsense?

482
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm serious. My mom was
questioned as a testifier today.

483
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,000
Are you serious?

484
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,610
But he's a good person.

485
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,380
He's Santa.

486
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,790
Who told you Grandpa was
arrested by the police?

487
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,060
Aunt Se Young came and told me.

488
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,190
Why did she tell him that?

489
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,030
He'll be out soon.

490
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,640
It's Choi Myung Ji.

491
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,240
Why is she here?

492
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,610
Do you think
she's here to see Eun Chong?

493
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,060
Why are you here?

494
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,360
Have you been well, Eun Chong?

495
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Come home with Little Grandma.

496
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,100
- Auntie Ha Na...
- It's okay.

497
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,040
He's not going anywhere.

498
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,210
The chairwoman left him here.
Why would he leave?

499
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,810
That was
before she fell into a coma.

500
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,410
From now on, I'm his legal guardian.

501
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,550
What are you talking about?

502
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,650
If you don't believe me,
you can look.

503
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,790
I am Eun Chong's guardian.

504
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,730
(Seoul Family Court,
Petitioner: Choi Myung Ji)

505
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,500
The court must've been crazy...

506
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,940
to grant this to you.

507
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,610
You. What are you doing?

508
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,710
Watch your attitude when you speak.

509
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,910
You two are both ridiculous.

510
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,080
Take him and go to your room.

511
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,920
Eun Chong, come with me.

512
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,090
It's all because the judge didn't know
how dangerous you were.

513
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,160
I'll tell them all about you...

514
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,000
and request a revocation.

515
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,130
What makes me so dangerous?

516
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,000
I adore him so much.

517
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,810
Was that why you drugged him
to put him to sleep,

518
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,180
then locked him up inside?

519
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,580
You put Chairwoman Shin
into a coma, didn't you?

520
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,850
I can't deal with this.

521
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,990
I saved her.

522
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,120
What about the hit-and-run accident?

523
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,260
- What?
- You instigated...

524
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,460
Du Na's hit-and-run accident,
didn't you?

525
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,860
You were the landlady...

526
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,330
she met, weren't you?

527
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,330
(Cinderella Game)

528
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,260
Choi Myung Ji became
his legal guardian?

529
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,630
This is your home, Eun Chong.

530
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,570
It's a do-or-die situation
for me, too.

531
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
Are you dating Ha Na?

532
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,310
You may not like it,
but please give us your support.

533
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,840
What will you do with Eun Chong?

534
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,640
I'll send him to study abroad.

535
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,780
- Are you leaving to study abroad?
- Leave within this week.

536
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,050
I hear Myung Ji
went on a trip with Eun Chong.

537
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,990
Your mom is the key suspect
for attempted murder.

538
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,920
She moved.
