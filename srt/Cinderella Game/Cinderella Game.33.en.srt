1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,339
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:07,379
(Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na are
biologically related.)

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,679
(Episode 33)

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,650
DNA parentage test report.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,689
I have to believe this, don't I?

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,160
If this paper says
she's my birth mother,

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,059
she must be, right?

10
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,929
Yes. Believe it.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,699
It's okay to believe it.

12
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,870
- Does the chairwoman know?
- Yes.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,570
Where is she right now?

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,409
Yu Jin.

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,909
I'll be good to Ms. Goo.

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,450
I'd treat her
as if you came back alive.

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,950
I'd even do everything
I wanted to do for you...

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,490
like she's my real daughter.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,619
I'll turn her
into Eun Chong's mother.

20
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:22,590
Yu Jin...

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,719
My baby.

22
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,859
My pumpkin.

23
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,599
I've been searching so hard for you.

24
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,609
I had no idea you were so nearby...

25
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,180
and had to spend
the last 20 years torn apart.

26
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,879
Was my name...

27
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,049
Yu Jin?

28
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,989
Yes.

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,420
You were Yu Jin.

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,359
Yoon Yu Jin.

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,799
Yu Jin...

32
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,900
Yoon Yu Jin...

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,780
People sell kite kits that are
much easier to make.

34
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,849
Why does he insist on
building it from scratch?

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,550
Can you really untangle the string
by using a needle?

36
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,819
What about that photo?

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,759
I have bad eyesight.

38
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,500
The three look quite close.

39
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,129
She must be Eun Chong's mother.

40
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:46,139
Yes, she was Ha Na's best friend
from the children's home.

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,310
She passed away in a car accident,

42
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,810
leaving Eun Chong all alone
in this harsh world.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,909
You might have bad eyesight,
but you noticed these beauties.

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,289
Eun Chong would be
sitting at a children's home...

45
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,500
with other little ones
if it hadn't been for Ha Na...

46
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,699
What?

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,439
Hey, I found a needle!

48
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,379
Yu Jin...

49
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,479
Grandpa.

50
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,289
Hey, Eun Chong.

51
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,490
I found the tangled part.

52
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,159
All right. Let's untangle that.

53
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,699
It began right here.

54
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,370
Yu Jin.

55
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,169
Please think of Eun Chong...

56
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,909
and make sure your mother
does not approach him anymore.

57
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,090
Life must've been
very tough for you.

58
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,759
But thank you for growing up into
such a healthy and beautiful woman.

59
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,230
I'd make up for every hardship
you went through to this day.

60
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,600
You can...

61
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,269
just trust me now.

62
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,370
Okay.

63
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,910
It still doesn't feel so real to me.

64
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,980
Yes, let's take it slow.

65
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,720
You don't remember anything about me,
so it's only natural.

66
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,889
I won't rush it.

67
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,519
I will...

68
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,730
No, Mommy will
tell you everything one by one.

69
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,100
All right.

70
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,730
I'd be your real mom,

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,740
just as you were to Eun Chong.

72
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,910
The chairwoman was...

73
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,480
the one who gave birth to me?

74
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,519
You used to look exactly like me
when you were younger.

75
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,360
Why couldn't I find you...

76
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,430
when I searched through
every children's home in Korea?

77
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,899
I also put out ads on TV
and newspapers to look for you.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But I finally found you now.

79
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,970
Everything is okay.

80
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,339
Let us never part again
from this day on.

81
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,310
Okay.

82
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,350
What about my father?

83
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,519
Yes, after he lost you,

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
he had a tough time,

85
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,459
engulfed by a sense of guilt.

86
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,490
He left home to find you
and hasn't come home.

87
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,259
He's probably somewhere
still looking for you.

88
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,370
Are you unable to reach him?

89
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,740
He'll come back...

90
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,069
once we're back in touch
now that I found you.

91
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,750
I sincerely want to tell the whole world
that I found you,

92
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,819
but you may fall into danger...

93
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,750
if people find out
you're my daughter.

94
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,459
Because I'm in business,
there are those who wish to slander me.

95
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:28,959
We had an accident
during Mr. Goo's inaugural ceremony.

96
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,230
Right. I see.

97
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,970
So, I wanted to share the news
with your siblings myself,

98
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,199
along with some cautionary notes.

99
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,240
May I visit you this weekend?

100
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,870
Of course.

101
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:46,310
Eun Chong already asked
when you'd come over.

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,610
Did he?

103
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,879
I also want to see him.

104
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,189
Thank you for showing consideration
for Eun Chong as well.

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,620
I found my daughter after 20 years,

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,660
but look at this situation I'm in.

107
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,589
I can't even say you're my girl.

108
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,370
I want to take you home...

109
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,399
and chat with you through the night,

110
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,709
but I have to be
at an important occasion today.

111
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,879
I have to leave
without even eating with you.

112
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,509
It's all right.

113
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,279
We have lots of time from now on.

114
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Can I give you another hug?

115
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,819
Yes.

116
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,730
Thank you...

117
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,360
for coming to me, Yu Jin.

118
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,939
I'll see you soon, Yu Jin.

119
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,480
All right. Goodbye.

120
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,189
Thank you...

121
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,430
for finding me.

122
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,649
Are you all right?

123
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,220
Yes.

124
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,029
This isn't a dream, is it?

125
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:57,639
She was a little over 160cm tall,

126
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,809
and she was rather good-looking.

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,809
Did they say anything
about a mom and her daughter?

128
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:05,250
I'm not sure.

129
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,720
What was the meeting like?

130
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,789
Did they cry a river or anything?

131
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,220
It was quiet.

132
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,860
She must've heard
a false rumor about Yu Jin.

133
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,399
How dare she deceive me
by meeting someone who resembles her?

134
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,799
You can't do this to me, Yeo Jin.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,840
I was the one who stuck around
and protected you...

136
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,179
after both Yu Jin
and Sung Ho left this place.

137
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,289
Yeo Jin, do you feel unwell?

138
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,019
Goodness.

139
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,429
- Have you been crying?
- Yes.

140
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,460
Why?

141
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,370
What happened, Ms. Jang?

142
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,169
- You may go home, Ms. Jang.
- Yes, ma'am.

143
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,409
Yeo Jin.

144
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,240
You know...

145
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,980
what I wish for the most
before the day I die, right?

146
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,879
It's to find Yu Jin.

147
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,120
I can now die in peace.

148
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,759
What do you mean?

149
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,830
Have you heard an update on Yu Jin?

150
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,759
I found Yu Jin.

151
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,440
I found Yu Jin. My baby.

152
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,039
Are you serious, Yeo Jin?

153
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,539
Was it really Yu Jin?

154
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,210
Did you conduct
a parentage test, too?

155
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,879
I did.

156
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,480
My goodness. I can't believe this.

157
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,019
How could she find her?
She already died.

158
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,460
Yeo Jin, congratulations.

159
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,129
Fate didn't overlook...

160
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,830
all the struggles you went through
until this day.

161
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,639
Where is she right now?

162
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,049
Did you just meet her?

163
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:15,980
Yes.

164
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,149
What does she look like
as a grownup?

165
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,850
Did she look similar
to how she was as a child?

166
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,389
Did you recognize her
at first sight?

167
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,289
It wasn't at first sight.

168
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,460
Do you have a photo of her?

169
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:35,100
We were too busy crying,
so I forgot to take one.

170
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,129
Well, I'll meet her soon in person.

171
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,470
Does she remember everything
from her childhood?

172
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,379
She must've been greatly shocked
after her disappearance.

173
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,940
She doesn't remember anything.

174
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,779
That was why
it took so long to meet her.

175
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,049
It's because she's not Yu Jin!

176
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,649
Who tried to con her like this?

177
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,320
When will she come here?

178
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,990
I need to ask you for something
before we do that.

179
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,230
Don't tell anyone else
that I found her.

180
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,129
Wait, why?

181
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,500
This is something
we need to celebrate in joy.

182
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,610
We need to tell everyone
and hold a party...

183
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,909
People won't leave her alone
once they find out she's my daughter.

184
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,539
- What if something happens...
- Right.

185
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,149
Yes, you're right.

186
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,210
We should be careful.

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,549
I really want to know
what she's like as a grownup.

188
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,659
Se Young would be thrilled, too.

189
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,600
Anyway, Yeo Jin.

190
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,470
You seemed
more composed than I thought.

191
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,200
Yu Jin and I had
already cried a river,

192
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,509
so I was just out of energy.

193
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,940
You should be full of energy...

194
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,639
even if you didn't have any
as soon as you found her!

195
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,549
You have no idea you were deceived.

196
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,519
Who was this con artist
that got you?

197
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,460
Yes, Detective Goo.

198
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,690
My sister-in-law said
she found her daughter.

199
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,759
It seemed like some con artists
got the best of her.

200
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,629
I want to get them
and teach them a lesson...

201
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,330
before she loses a lot of money,
so look into it.

202
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,330
Someone tried
to con Chairwoman Shin?

203
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,470
Tell me about it.

204
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,740
She wasn't the type
who'd get conned.

205
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,639
She said she finished conducting
the parentage test,

206
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,710
so it must be an organized crime,
not some lone criminal.

207
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,850
I doubt that.

208
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:31,279
It'd make sense if Chairwoman Shin
made a fake daughter for herself.

209
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,549
"A fake daughter?"

210
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,750
Why would she do that?

211
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,889
She may not want to give you
everything she has.

212
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,460
What?

213
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,230
Why don't we prepare
Korean cuisine for breakfast...

214
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,029
and add a Korean cuisine section
in the buffet...

215
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,870
at the New York branch
as the New Year's event?

216
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,039
What will we serve?

217
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,870
The dishes we usually have
on New Year's Day...

218
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,139
include rice cake soup,
dumpling soup, and beef bone soup.

219
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,840
We can serve it with radish kimchi
or radish water kimchi.

220
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,279
We can serve
frozen soft persimmon for dessert...

221
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,279
What will we serve as breakfast
for room service?

222
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,580
We can pick something
among the dishes in the buffet...

223
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,120
The breakfast we serve in the room
must be easy to eat.

224
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,350
The guests will have this
as soon as they wake up,

225
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,120
so something not too heavy.

226
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,730
Something like porridge.
Egg porridge.

227
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:30,639
Wake up. It's the New Year's Day.
Let's eat something together.

228
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,750
- I don't want rice cake soup.
- It's not rice cake soup.

229
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,580
- Then?
- It's your soul food.

230
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,620
Egg porridge?

231
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,649
Yes.

232
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,590
You aren't even my dad.

233
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,259
Stop pretending to be one, Ji Seok.

234
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,059
Happy New Year.

235
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,039
Send me the project proposal,
and you can go home.

236
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,639
You're spacing out again.

237
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,110
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes, right.

238
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,549
What's on your mind?
You're spacing out at work.

239
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,250
Will you stop minding me?

240
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,419
Jin Goo will notice soon.

241
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,120
I would've noticed already.

242
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,889
He must be a little slow.

243
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,250
Hey, Mom.

244
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,549
I'm done.

245
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,090
What?

246
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,590
What do you mean she found Yu Jin?

247
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,529
What are you talking about?

248
00:15:58,529 --> 00:15:59,730
Listen to me.

249
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,470
You have to get a grip on yourself
from now on.

250
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,440
Was she really Yu Jin?

251
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,269
Was she the real one?

252
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,539
I don't think she is...

253
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,409
She doesn't remember anything
from her childhood.

254
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,610
She doesn't know anything
about her disappearance.

255
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,350
So, you can relax.

256
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,149
Aunt Yeo Jin was
with Yu Jin on that day, right?

257
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,220
You said she'd never show up!

258
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,649
Breathe slowly.

259
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,620
Nothing will happen
as long as you trust me.

260
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,460
But it did!

261
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,360
What can Yu Jin do anyway,
even if she shows up now?

262
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,200
Just trust me...

263
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,129
and keep a straight face
when you come home. Okay?

264
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,799
No, I'm not going home.

265
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,940
What's with you?

266
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,669
Pull yourself together.
Yu Jin came back.

267
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,940
How should you act around your aunt?

268
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,539
You should be thrilled
and celebrating with her.

269
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,850
Hey. Hello?

270
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,590
Goodness, this girl.

271
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,389
It's not like I can tell her
that she's a fake daughter.

272
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,429
Yu Jin came back?

273
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,430
This can't happen.

274
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,799
This can't happen.

275
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,910
- No.
- Ms. Yoon.

276
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,509
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

277
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,480
- Do you?
- Mind your own business.

278
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,700
Why are you trembling?

279
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:50,640
Listen to me.

280
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,680
This is an order from your superior.

281
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:56,410
- Let me take you home.
- I'm not going home.

282
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,890
(Mom)

283
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:07,890
Yu Jin!

284
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,250
Stop nibbling on that.
You're bleeding.

285
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,359
You need a warm drink.

286
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,670
Why won't she pick up? Good grief.

287
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,069
Is she unable
to keep herself together?

288
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,609
She'll ruin everything
just before it's done!

289
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,910
The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please leave...

290
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,839
Where are you cooped up?

291
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,349
(Lala Palace, Unit 1002)

292
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,420
Her newlywed home.

293
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,099
Do you think I'll do well
as the chairwoman's daughter?

294
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,569
I couldn't be compared
to the chairwoman as her daughter.

295
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,430
I don't want to shame her...

296
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,369
She's your mom, and you're her girl.
Why would you worry about that?

297
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,009
Is this too much?

298
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:30,670
It feels like everything is
surging like a tsunami.

299
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,509
It doesn't even feel real,

300
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,250
so I don't even feel like
this is great news.

301
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,579
I'd forget it altogether,
then be surprised every now and then.

302
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,720
I can't believe
I'm Hyesung Group's daughter.

303
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:45,160
But you're still happy, right?

304
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,190
- Yes.
- That's what's important.

305
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,759
You can relax and move through this
in your own way.

306
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,059
Let me know
if anything troubles you.

307
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,130
I'll help you out.

308
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,700
Goodness, I don't want
to owe you anymore, Mr. Hwang.

309
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,039
I'd feel bad for the chairwoman,

310
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,539
if I end up in another scandal.

311
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,180
Right! Our bet.

312
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,049
- You owe me 100 dollars.
- Gosh.

313
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:15,319
I usually win all my bets. Man.

314
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,789
Goodness.
I only have 50 dollars in cash.

315
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,089
I'll take that.

316
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,529
- My gosh!
- Whoa.

317
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,079
Goodness.

318
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,109
No one saw that, right?

319
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,509
- Why?
- I don't want anyone...

320
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,519
to misunderstand me again.

321
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:48,289
Once bitten, twice shy...

322
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,160
Gosh. That was such an old saying.

323
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,089
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,789
That wasn't what I meant.

325
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,700
I guess I just have many things
to apologize to you for.

326
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,640
I find myself saying those words
without thinking.

327
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,170
I'll give you
the other half next time.

328
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,650
- You should go.
- Okay.

329
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,319
Goodbye.

330
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:42,940
- My gosh!
- Whoa.

331
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,750
My heart raced so loudly.

332
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,150
He probably heard that, right?

333
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:16,440
- Yes, Mom.
- Yali won't come out of her hiding.

334
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,210
What do I do?

335
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,609
She just feels strange
at a new place.

336
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,309
She'll be fine in a few days.

337
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,119
Don't worry about it.

338
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,119
Yes.

339
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,490
(Mother-in-Law)

340
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,119
Mom, I'm getting a call. Bye.

341
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,460
Yes, Mother.

342
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,029
No, Se Young went to work
at the hotel today.

343
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,569
Our newlywed home?

344
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,069
You need to either sleep
or eat something.

345
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,049
Or go home.

346
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,809
Your mom keeps calling you.

347
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:00,650
What's wrong?

348
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,390
- Bye.
- I don't want to be here alone.

349
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,200
You told me not to bite my nails.

350
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,400
I need to hold the cup
to stop myself.

351
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,940
Or can you hold me in your arms?

352
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,420
You don't mean it.

353
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,789
Can't you just hold me?

354
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,529
You said you wanted
to spend the night with me.

355
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,759
Holding me isn't a big deal.

356
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,829
Then, spend the night with me.

357
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,930
If you feel lonely,
you can call Hwang Jin Goo.

358
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,539
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

359
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,529
Oh, hello.

360
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,299
Right. Ms. Goo's younger sister.

361
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,599
Hello.

362
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,799
Do you live here?

363
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,440
Well, not yet.
It's my newlywed home.

364
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,039
I see.

365
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:02,769
We're neighbors.

366
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,240
Then, see you around.

367
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:06,640
Right.

368
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,349
By any chance, is something going on
between you and my sister?

369
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,319
- No.
- Right?

370
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,789
Of course.
You have a fiancee like Ms. Yoon.

371
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,789
Never mind, then.

372
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,779
Jin Goo, what brings you here
without calling?

373
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,180
I called you,
but you didn't pick up.

374
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,190
Mother was worried
that you weren't picking up.

375
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,759
What were you up to?

376
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,359
I fell asleep.

377
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,460
I felt under the weather
while I was at work.

378
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,230
Did you catch a cold?

379
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,069
You're a bit feverish.
And your cheeks are red.

380
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,140
I feel better after taking a nap.

381
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,039
Shall we?

382
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,240
You also heard
about finding Yu Jin, right?

383
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,740
Yes.

384
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,220
It would've been much better...

385
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,390
if you wore this instead of Ms. Goo.

386
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,930
It would've been much better
if I met with you today.

387
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:45,339
Ms. Chairwoman. No.

388
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:50,880
You can take your time.

389
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,549
Come live with your mom now.

390
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,289
Your room is
still the same as before.

391
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,960
I'll redecorate
that room beautifully.

392
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,559
Do you not want to come?

393
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,559
It's not that.

394
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,599
I have my younger siblings
and Eun Chong.

395
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,410
Your siblings are all grown up.

396
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,839
Were you concerned about Eun Chong?

397
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,950
Then, bring Eun Chong
and move in with me.

398
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,180
I have to live
away from my siblings?

399
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:32,359
I'll only take Eun Chong
and move into the chairwoman's... No.

400
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,289
To my mom's place?

401
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,000
Gosh, why is it so hard
to call her my mom?

402
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,829
I'm hungry. Should I serve the rice?

403
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,769
Yes. Right.
Ask Mr. Han to dine with us.

404
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,410
- He went out for a walk.
- Did he?

405
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,039
We were getting good use
out of that bidet,

406
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,240
so should I reduce his monthly rent?

407
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,380
No!

408
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,920
He installed that
because he suffered from hemorrhoids.

409
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,079
Well, it's also keeping us warm.

410
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,589
You're right.

411
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,559
I mean, a tushy warmer at our place?

412
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,890
On top of that, he said
he'd install a heater in the bathroom.

413
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,130
Even a heater?

414
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,200
He seems like the real Santa Claus.

415
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:19,039
They wouldn't believe me
if I said my mom was the chairwoman.

416
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,470
Should I give them a warning
before they fall over in shock...

417
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,210
in front of the chairwoman?

418
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,910
What do you think...

419
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,480
it'll be like
if I find my birth mother?

420
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,190
Your birth mother? That was random.

421
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,619
You don't even know her name.

422
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:38,960
Or if she's dead or alive.

423
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,329
Why?
Did you hear something about her?

424
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,990
I was just asking.

425
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,599
What would it be like
if something that dramatic happened?

426
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:52,640
If she's your mother,
she's my grandmother.

427
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,339
I hope you find her.

428
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,039
Really?

429
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,710
If it's good news for you,
then I'm always down.

430
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,940
- We're always down!
- Always down!

431
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,849
You also heard
about finding Yu Jin, right?

432
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
By Yu Jin, she must mean...

433
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,259
Chairwoman Shin's daughter,
Yoon Yu Jin.

434
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,859
She was busy with her daughter,
just as I speculated.

435
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,869
It's me, sir.

436
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,170
Hey, yes.

437
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,509
Chairwoman Shin found her daughter?

438
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:33,609
Yes, I overheard Yoon Se Young
saying it to Hwang Jin Goo.

439
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,609
She said Yu Jin was found,

440
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,980
and she must've meant...

441
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,779
Chairwoman Shin's daughter,
Yoon Yu Jin.

442
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,990
Sir?

443
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,390
Oh, yes.

444
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,690
Check and see if it's accurate.

445
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:50,059
Yes, if she found her daughter,

446
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,000
it'd change the order of succession.

447
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,799
We should get ready, too.

448
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,099
We'll discuss that in person.
Goodbye.

449
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,069
She found Yu Jin?

450
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:04,640
What's going on?

451
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,579
No, let me tell you this again.

452
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,079
Even if she's your birth mother,

453
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,079
I'm only down if she's rich.

454
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,349
What if she isn't?

455
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,789
If she's coming to live off you...

456
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,930
because she got older and sick,

457
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,230
then I'm sorry, but no.

458
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,759
You can't take her in
even if she's your birth mother.

459
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,460
"Birth mother?"

460
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,430
You're harsh.

461
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,299
No, she's the harsh one.

462
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,599
The least she can do is
compensate you for your troubles,

463
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,970
not becoming another burden for you.

464
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:37,309
Gosh, where is her conscience?

465
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:38,470
No way.

466
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,279
If she's rich, she's welcome,

467
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,180
but if she's poor,
then she's not welcome?

468
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,180
She isn't just not welcome.
She's so, extremely not welcome.

469
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,589
She'll have to be rich, then.

470
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,089
Anyway, why did you suddenly ask
about your birth mother?

471
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,690
She said Yu Jin was found,

472
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,990
and she must've meant...

473
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,730
Chairwoman Shin's daughter,
Yoon Yu Jin.

474
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,529
Wait, could she be
the Yu Jin she found?

475
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,670
Did you go out for a walk?

476
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,599
- Please have dinner with us.
- Sure.

477
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,940
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

478
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,509
but did you find your birth mother?

479
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,680
Please keep it a secret
from my siblings.

480
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,410
Why? It's great news.

481
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,250
She said she'd come home
and tell them herself.

482
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,750
By any chance,

483
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,759
was she the one you met
a few days ago,

484
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,089
the chairwoman of your workplace?

485
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,700
How did you know?

486
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,599
It's a secret.

487
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:31,289
(Cinderella Game)

488
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:33,089
Mom, where do you get the confidence
to be so composed?

489
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,059
What will you do
if you don't trust me?

490
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,130
What can you do alone without me?

491
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,559
I'll only think of Eun Chong.

492
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,660
Is she testing you
and your daughter?

493
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,299
I'm afraid this will...

494
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,529
harm you and your sister
in the gravest way.

495
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,170
Don't you have any ambition?

496
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,470
Don't you want to be her successor?

497
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,240
You should've chosen me,
not Hwang Jin Goo.

498
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,569
You're a better match with me.

499
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,180
You're the owner of that room.

500
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,640
You're just a toy.

501
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,079
I haven't even started.
Let's not get scared.
