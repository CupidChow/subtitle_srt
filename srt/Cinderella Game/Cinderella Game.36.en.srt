00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,139
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,650
Do you feel happy to be...

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,710
(Episode 36)

6
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:11,580
Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

7
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,449
I met the woman
who gave birth to me.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,059
Yes, I'm happy.

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,789
But still, my foster parents are
my first parents to me.

10
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,129
All of you are
my dearest family, too.

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,429
That'll never change.

12
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,100
To our family, she's...

13
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:30,570
What?

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,200
To our family, she's an enemy.

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,210
You just became
the enemy's daughter.

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,740
Please be happy for me, Ji Seok.

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,740
I want you to celebrate with me...

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,280
- more than anyone.
- Why?

19
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:42,909
I'd feel like...

20
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,750
I was really her daughter
only if you celebrated with me.

21
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,149
Will you...

22
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,320
do that?

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,359
I won't.

24
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,630
You can live
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,299
We'll manage on our own.

26
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,700
I'll talk to Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,840
What do you mean?

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,239
Please sever your ties...

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,939
with Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

30
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,040
Goo Ji Seok.

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,150
Why are you doing this again?

32
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,980
I try to understand you,
but it's just impossible!

33
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,549
It's not like I'm your enemy.

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,120
Don't you think you're too harsh?

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,920
Yes, you are my enemy.

36
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,530
See? It would've been better
if you left when my parents passed.

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,430
You kept sticking around
even when I told you to leave.

38
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,969
It must've been for you to leave
after you met your birth mother.

39
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,939
Stop saying what you don't mean.

40
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,640
And don't talk like
severing our ties are that easy.

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,280
All of you are family to me.

42
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,540
- The chairwoman is...
- Chairwoman Shin must be something.

43
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:48,609
She severed...

44
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,849
our 20 years in an instant.

45
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,519
I said, that was enough.

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,090
This is it for us.

47
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,120
Have a good life.

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,390
Ji Seok.

49
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,900
Hey! Ji Seok!

50
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,370
Ji Seok.

51
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,439
Ji Seok...

52
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,629
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

53
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,469
Hey! What's wrong with you?

54
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:57,979
Ms. Goo!

55
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,550
- Are you okay?
- Ji Seok...

56
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,020
What's wrong?

57
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,659
It's... Can you find Ji Seok?

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,819
Your sister is looking for you.

59
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,590
Why are you
suddenly popping into the picture?

60
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,060
I saw you
and your sister by chance...

61
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,430
as a neighbor.

62
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,599
Please tell her I said everything
that needed to be said.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,969
Wait. It feels awkward
to meddle with you and her,

64
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,009
but I'm also involved
in the chairwoman and her business.

65
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,539
So, let me ask you out of curiosity.

66
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,780
Did you say you wouldn't accept
how she was the chairwoman's daughter?

67
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,310
I said I accepted it,

68
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,919
so we should each go our way.

69
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,349
You don't have to go that far...

70
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,259
Have some.

71
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:24,240
The person you have reached...

72
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,439
Where are you? Are you at home?

73
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,209
Yes, to whom do I owe the honor?

74
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,410
The heiress of Hyesung Group is
calling me herself this early.

75
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:35,180
Call me right away
when Ji Seok comes home.

76
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,379
Okay. How did you know
he wasn't home?

77
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,350
Make sure you call me.

78
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:42,990
Wait, Ha Na!

79
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,889
May I go study abroad?

80
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,689
I always wanted to study fashion,

81
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,560
and the chairwoman said she'd help.

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,629
We'll talk later.

83
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,430
Why is Director Goo doing this?

84
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,100
I don't understand
why he's taking things that far.

85
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,410
His business must be
more important than me.

86
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:09,509
Yes, Ms. Jang.

87
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:13,579
I'm sorry. I'll be there soon.

88
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,920
Mr. Hwang, I must go now.

89
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,740
Hello.

90
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,319
Why were you
with Eun Chong's aunt again?

91
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,689
Our neighbors all know
you're engaged,

92
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,930
so what if an odd rumor
begins to go around?

93
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:55,589
I ran into her by chance.

94
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,430
Even if you two met by chance,
you should've just walked past her.

95
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,670
- Are you going to Se Young's place?
- I am.

96
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,500
You're taken.

97
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,170
You'll have a lot to handle
from now on,

98
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,839
looking after both Se Young
and the chairwoman's daughter.

99
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,110
Stop wasting your energy
on the wrong thing.

100
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,779
All right.

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,259
There are no traces of Yu Jin.

102
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,360
If you had a room of your own,

103
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,730
what would you want to put there?

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,639
I sleep next to Auntie Ha Na,

105
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,470
so I want a vanity table for her,
a bed,

106
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,279
and a closet.

107
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,680
Is there anything you want?

108
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,910
Something like toys, gaming devices,

109
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,480
or storybooks.

110
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,620
Auntie Ha Na is all I need.

111
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:03,660
All we need now is new furniture.

112
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,569
Yeo Jin, how did Yu Jin live...

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
to this day?

114
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,339
Has she lived
as an orphan all along?

115
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,310
Or was she adopted?

116
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,610
She met great parents.

117
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,850
Did she?

118
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,189
Anyway, why do you look so forlorn?

119
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,089
Are you thinking of the old days?

120
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:31,790
I'm just happy.

121
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:33,319
Happy, my foot.

122
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,889
Why would you be happy
about your fake daughter?

123
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,699
Yeo Jin,
shouldn't you tell Sung Ho...

124
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,730
that you found Yu Jin?

125
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,839
He's out of touch.
Why would I do that?

126
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,370
He doesn't deserve to see her.

127
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,410
Or is it because there's no reason
to show him a fake daughter?

128
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,980
You're here, my son-in-law.

129
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,920
Have you been well?

130
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:03,689
Don't you dare say you're busy
and make Se Young feel lonely.

131
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,389
I won't let you live.

132
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,519
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,160
Stop it, Mom.

134
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,060
- Come in for a second, Jin Goo.
- Yes, ma'am.

135
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,040
Is she going to talk about Yu Jin?

136
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,040
Should I put a tapping device
in her room?

137
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,339
Can you do it?

138
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,779
You couldn't even install...

139
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,180
a location-tracking app
on Jin Goo's phone.

140
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,779
It might be easier to tap her room.

141
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,049
Should I prepare something
before her fake daughter comes?

142
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,919
He asked her
to sever ties with them?

143
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,460
It'd benefit Mr. Goo
for Ha Na to be my daughter.

144
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,960
Why did he say something so harsh?

145
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,559
We should begin...

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,129
by going back to his
and Richard Han's intention...

147
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,500
of investing in us
to find the reason,

148
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,740
and why he tried
to put Hyesung Tour down.

149
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,870
Are they out to take us over?

150
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,940
You said Richard Han would return to Korea
at the end of the month.

151
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,009
Schedule a meeting
as soon as he lands.

152
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,250
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,779
It's even better
if Mr. Goo wishes...

154
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,990
to sever his ties with Ha Na.

155
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,549
I got worried when he said...

156
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,159
the age of their disappearances
wasn't the same.

157
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,389
This means he accepts me
as Ha Na's birth mother.

158
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,330
It's better that she distances herself
from her siblings...

159
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,899
to flawlessly become my daughter...

160
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,570
and live as Eun Chong's mother.

161
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,769
But to Ms. Goo, that's too...

162
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:27,840
Harsh?

163
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,970
I'll compensate her that much.

164
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:34,110
That kind of compensation won't be
what she'll want.

165
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,220
Her younger siblings mean
more than her family to her.

166
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,250
How much do you know about her?

167
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,820
They don't have
any blood relations anyway.

168
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,029
She's still just a naive kid
who doesn't know the value of money.

169
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,330
She'll change once she does.

170
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,230
Ha Na is my daughter.

171
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,740
From now on,

172
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,970
Eun Chong and I are her family,
not her siblings.

173
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,940
And you also shouldn't forget that.

174
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,580
Did she talk about Yu Jin?

175
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,289
It was about Goo Ji Seok.

176
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,090
What about him?

177
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,720
He's trying to put
Hyesung Tour down.

178
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,389
I think he's using the investment as bait
to take us over.

179
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,759
That was your initial guess.

180
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
Spotting the evidence
is the problem.

181
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,870
The official document
from Dubai was fabricated.

182
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,940
It was as expected.

183
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,870
I just need to expose Goo Ji Seok
as the mastermind.

184
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:39,379
I'll catch something
once Richard Han comes to Korea.

185
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,649
Should I install
a tapping device in his office?

186
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,850
That's illegal and dangerous.

187
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,179
He probably has
an antibugging device anyway.

188
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,289
Is that so?

189
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,860
Did Aunt Yeo Jin also install
an antibugging device?

190
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:55,960
Come in.

191
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,429
Did you pack
all your summer clothes and shoes?

192
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:00,659
Yes, they're in here.

193
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,470
All right. Give me the clothes...

194
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,830
- to send to the dry cleaners.
- Sure.

195
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,169
That's a lot.

196
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,970
- Here.
- Just this one?

197
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,039
- Yes.
- Okay.

198
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,480
What? What's this?

199
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,820
It's a cufflink.

200
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,990
- Is this yours?
- It's not mine.

201
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,429
Well, I saw it on the floor
at the office,

202
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,730
so I picked it up thinking it was
one of my staff's, then forgot.

203
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,230
But Mr. Yoon doesn't wear that.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
Was it really one of our staff's?

205
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,570
Throw it out
if you don't know whose it is.

206
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,710
Why did you keep it around?

207
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,279
We should go, too.

208
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,679
Okay.

209
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,669
Ms. Ha Na, please take a look
and see if you like anything.

210
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,240
Okay.

211
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,299
It looks so good on you.

212
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,080
You can live
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

213
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,879
We'll manage on our own.

214
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,120
Ma'am, what about this one?

215
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,389
Ms. Ha Na.

216
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,620
Ms. Ha Na?

217
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,960
- Yes?
- What about this one?

218
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,799
That one looks great on you, too.

219
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,330
This must be hard on Mr. Goo.

220
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,399
How could this relationship be
so ill-fated?

221
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,169
The age of their disappearances
doesn't line up,

222
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,769
yet Chairwoman Shin and Ms. Goo
are sure of their relationship.

223
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:27,279
They'll have to believe
the parentage test, I guess.

224
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,620
It was probably
because Ms. Goo agreed to do this.

225
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,549
Yet Mr. Goo has...

226
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,620
a tough time accepting this?

227
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,490
It must be hard to accept that
his sister is his enemy's daughter.

228
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,830
Why don't you meet with him?

229
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,500
What he needs now isn't consolation.

230
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,370
The problem is how he will push through
this situation.

231
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,000
Will he continue with his revenge,
or will he stop?

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,470
What do you think, sir?

233
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,679
Wouldn't it be better
for him to stop here?

234
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,340
Please try to persuade him, sir.

235
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,649
Where is he right now?

236
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,549
I can't reach him.

237
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,129
(Ms. Han)

238
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,480
Pull yourself together.

239
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,850
Your older sister
went through so much because of you.

240
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,779
She had to look after you
whenever you got locked up in prison.

241
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,019
Yes, I deserve to die.

242
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,860
I only make...

243
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,659
my poor sister suffer.

244
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,629
You fool. You idiot. You coward.

245
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,639
- What now, you punk?
- You should've done something.

246
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,070
You did nothing for her
like an idiot.

247
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,179
You should
sever your ties with her, too.

248
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,620
Hey. You.

249
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,289
What the heck are you saying,
you crazy punk?

250
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,919
Why did you hit him?

251
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,720
What do you want?

252
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,830
Let's go.

253
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:41,950
Excuse me.

254
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,149
Hey, Ji Seok.

255
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,580
Yes, I'm his older sister.

256
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,950
At a cart bar?

257
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,730
Hang in there, Ji Seok. We're here.

258
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,100
Ms. Goo.

259
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,600
Mr. Hwang.

260
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,409
What happened to him? Is he drunk?

261
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,639
Yes.

262
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,039
He can't take his alcohol.
Why did he drink this early?

263
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,850
Mr. Goo, wake up.

264
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,019
President Hwang Jin Goo?

265
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,789
What happened to his lips?

266
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,149
Did he get into a fight?

267
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,590
Hey, the poor woman.

268
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,429
And next to the poor woman is...

269
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:36,629
another poor... No, not anymore.

270
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,840
Someone who was poor...

271
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,710
What are you talking about?

272
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,970
Goodbye, then.

273
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,730
Why did it have to be her?

274
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,900
You have no idea
what it took for me to return here.

275
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,769
You have no idea
what it took for me to hold out.

276
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,509
I also didn't expect the chairwoman
to be my birth mother, Ji Seok.

277
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,880
Why did you say
you wanted to sever ties...

278
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,650
if you were going to have
such a tough time?

279
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,289
You were only saying that,

280
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,230
just as you always had, right?

281
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Hey.

282
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,880
- Did you put that on already?
- Yes.

283
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,410
These were delivered right now
from the department store.

284
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:58,150
Clothes, heels, and shoes.

285
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,490
You cleaned out the whole store.

286
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,990
Why didn't you get me anything?

287
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,390
Are you playing favorites?

288
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,789
Did your birth mother
buy these for you?

289
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,000
Mr. Han, do you know...

290
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
who her birth mother is?

291
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,430
I told him.

292
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,369
Do not go out and tell anyone.

293
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,200
I won't.

294
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,109
Eun Chong, you look like a prince
in these clothes.

295
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,210
You look wonderful.

296
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:27,079
You also look wonderful to me.

297
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,509
Ha Na, I heard
you went to the department store.

298
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,619
What did you get?

299
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,380
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey.

300
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,019
I told you to go home.
Why did you come here?

301
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,650
Go home and look after Ji Seok.

302
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Why did he get drunk
in the middle of the day?

303
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,730
Did he not pick up
because he was drinking?

304
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,269
This Shine bracelet...
Ha Na, may I try this on?

305
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,029
I want to see how different it is
from the knockoff I have.

306
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,039
Stop distracting me and go home.

307
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,869
Ji Chang, can you bathe Eun Chong?

308
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,279
What? I have to plan my business.

309
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,150
May I do that?

310
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,150
You, Mr. Han?

311
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:16,430
Eun Chong, are you happy to move
to your bestie granny's place?

312
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,299
Yes, Auntie Ha Na
won't have to suffer...

313
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:22,200
now that she has a rich mommy,

314
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,000
and she can adopt me, too.

315
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,140
It's a great thing for you,
Eun Chong.

316
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,210
We won't be able to meet as often
when you move.

317
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,180
Auntie Ha Na and I will come over...

318
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,849
because Uncle Ji Chang
and you'll be here.

319
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,119
Will you do that?

320
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,950
Even when you go there,
don't tell anyone I live here.

321
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,619
Okay. Santa, you granted...

322
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,690
Auntie Ha Na's wish, right?

323
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,390
Thank you.

324
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,799
Let's make bubbles, Santa.

325
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,769
Okay.

326
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:09,410
Eun Chong. Is it better
that your aunt does not know?

327
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,950
Is it for the best...

328
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,279
for Auntie Ha Na and you...

329
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,690
to go to your grandma's place
just as your grandma wants?

330
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,769
I bought more clothes today
than everything I bought in my life,

331
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,170
including the bags and shoes.

332
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,779
I'll give you
much better things in the future.

333
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:42,650
Ms. Jang said you had to leave
after an urgent call.

334
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,779
Is something going on?

335
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,420
It was nothing.

336
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,690
Thank you so much for today.

337
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,319
That's not something you say
to your mom.

338
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,519
Everything I have is yours.

339
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,930
Is that Yu Jin?

340
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,730
I'm also glad that you like it.

341
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,740
I heard our personal shopper said
you were pretty.

342
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,799
Did she go to the VIP room?

343
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,880
Aunt Yeo Jin,
are you talking to Yu Jin?

344
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,690
Ms. Kim, when will the Shine blouse
come from Paris?

345
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,359
I'll be there next week. Right.

346
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:36,829
Ms. Jang was there today, right?

347
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
What was the girl she was with like?

348
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,809
I know
you must keep things confidential.

349
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,410
Then, just tell me what she got.

350
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,720
We're cousins,
so we can't have the same items.

351
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,349
All right, Ms. Kim.

352
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,160
- Who was that?
- Ms. Kim at the department store.

353
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,359
Yu Jin went there
with Ms. Jang today...

354
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,029
and bought Luvian earrings
and necklace.

355
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,829
They were
much cheaper than I expected.

356
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,569
That's how inadequate her taste is.

357
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,740
Forget Yu Jin. You.

358
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:18,109
That cufflink
belonged to him, didn't it?

359
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,309
I told you. No.

360
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,640
How dare you deceive me?

361
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,349
Wait, are you seeing him?

362
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:27,450
Are you crazy? I work for him!

363
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,490
He dropped it in his office,
so I just picked it up.

364
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,920
Why did you pick it up?

365
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,130
The least you could do was
throw it out.

366
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,730
Why did you pick it up
like it was precious?

367
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,160
I just forgot.

368
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,400
Don't you dare
do something like this again.

369
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,369
Aunt Yeo Jin probably installed
an antibugging device.

370
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,039
I was going to look into it.

371
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,680
I'll do whatever it takes
to find a way.

372
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,220
Harsh?

373
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,119
I'll compensate her that much.

374
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:09,160
She's still just a naive kid
who doesn't know the value of money.

375
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,559
She'll change once she does.

376
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,759
Ha Na is my daughter.

377
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,299
From now on,

378
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,670
Eun Chong and I are her family,
not her siblings.

379
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,369
And you also shouldn't forget that.

380
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,009
I got into this because I wanted...

381
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:25,109
Ms. Goo, the chairwoman,
and Eun Chong, everyone to be happy.

382
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,650
Why does it feel like
it's only hard for Ms. Goo?

383
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,720
Are you home?

384
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,690
How's Mr. Goo?

385
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,289
I saw him fall asleep before I left.

386
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,130
Did you two have a talk?

387
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,559
No, I'll go to his office tomorrow.

388
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,970
He probably felt bad
after saying what he said.

389
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,599
I hope he changes his mind.

390
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:54,440
Yes.

391
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,569
This is a family affair,
so I can't do anything to help.

392
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,480
But no rain, no flowers.

393
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,750
You did this last time, too.
You know exactly when to use it.

394
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,420
I'm good at practical applications.

395
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,220
I hope your flower will bloom.

396
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,759
Thank you.

397
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,430
Goodbye, then. All right.

398
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,730
(Ji Seok)

399
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,440
Everyone will be happy...

400
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,210
if you change your mind.

401
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,950
Pick up your phone.

402
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:41,990
We need to talk.
At least give me an answer.

403
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,450
I'll get mad
if you keep acting like this.

404
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,559
Ji Seok, do you feel okay?

405
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,670
You even hurt your lips.

406
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,769
You never do anything like this.

407
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,910
- I'm fine.
- Stay still.

408
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,819
Ha Na told me
to put ointment on you...

409
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,779
and make sure you eat
the bean sprout soup she made.

410
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,420
Tell Ji Chang
to come home on the weekend.

411
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,390
I have something to say.

412
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,690
- What about Ha Na?
- It's just for Ji Chang and you.

413
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,529
Are we throwing
a surprise party for her?

414
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,599
Ji Seok, you heard, right?

415
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,759
Isn't this crazy?

416
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,900
I can't believe
she's a rich family's daughter.

417
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:31,599
How can something like this
happen to us?

418
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,869
The chairwoman said
we were all her children...

419
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,670
because Ha Na was her daughter.

420
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,279
I can't believe it.

421
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:40,509
She said she'd support
Ji Chang and me...

422
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,210
if there were things
we wanted to learn.

423
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:47,250
I would've gone abroad to study
if Mom and Dad were still alive.

424
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:50,319
I want to go abroad
and study fashion.

425
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,420
- The chairwoman...
- I'll let you go.

426
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,630
- You will?
- Don't take a penny from her.

427
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,230
- Why not?
- Don't.

428
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,700
What's he saying? Is he too proud?

429
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,569
How cute.

430
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,970
Ji Seok, relieve your hangover
with the bean sprout soup!

431
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,130
Is something going on
between you and Goo Ha Na?

432
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,000
I mean, yesterday too...

433
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,970
And weren't you coming from her
place when you crashed into my car?

434
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,839
I heard Goo Ha Na met her birth mother.
Is that the problem?

435
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,410
Did you decide
to ignore me altogether?

436
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,750
Then, keep your attitude consistent.

437
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,250
Why do you keep saying I'm poor?

438
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,680
If that word gets on your nerves,

439
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,289
you must also know how poor you are.

440
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,490
You already know
the real poor woman.

441
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,519
The woman who shares your last name.

442
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,690
- Goo Ha Na?
- Yes.

443
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,799
That's why I pity you.

444
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,430
You have no idea you're holding onto
a decaying lifeline.

445
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,440
Are you saying Jin Goo is
a decaying lifeline?

446
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,970
You should've come to me
while the offer was valid.

447
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,880
You wouldn't lose anything.

448
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,980
What would I lose?

449
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,960
I asked you. What would I lose?

450
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,559
- Hyesung Group.
- Tell me.

451
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:40,660
Hwang Jin Goo.

452
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,769
Are you saying
I'll lose Jin Goo to someone?

453
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,299
Wait, is it Goo Ha Na?

454
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,470
Do you have evidence?

455
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:51,140
Do you have evidence that
something is between them?

456
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,710
Do they have to do something
for you to lose him?

457
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,980
In that aspect,
you and I have already...

458
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,789
done something.

459
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,289
Stop coming onto me.

460
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,230
Don't make a big deal
out of one kiss.

461
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,359
- There are CCTVs here.
- So?

462
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,569
Should we do it again
under the camera?

463
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:24,970
You're crazy.

464
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,960
Do you feel better?

465
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,460
We need to talk.

466
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,230
You got drunk and into a fight
because this was hard for you, too!

467
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,099
I had a drink
because I just felt awful.

468
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,740
Don't come over even if someone calls
from my phone like yesterday.

469
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,339
We're strangers now.

470
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,339
Should I call you
Ms. Ha Na from now on?

471
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,279
You're too harsh.

472
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,420
I get the animosity between you
and the chairwoman in business,

473
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:10,119
but why do you take things this far?

474
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,259
Is there another problem
other than business I don't know about?

475
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,559
Stop overreacting.

476
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,900
Did you think
you were that significant to me?

477
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,069
We began as strangers
who didn't share a drop of blood.

478
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:26,940
I said we'd go back to our places.
So, what's the problem?

479
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,509
- Are you really...
- We're at work.

480
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:32,339
Please stay professional.

481
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:35,180
Head Director Goo Ji Seok,
who's good at staying professional...

482
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,710
Tour Guide Goo Ha Na,
do you have anything to say?

483
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,849
If you don't, please leave.

484
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,690
Goo Ji Seok!

485
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,259
Please ban her
from entering my office.

486
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,730
Wait, is that not allowed
in this hierarchy...

487
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,089
because you are
the chairwoman's daughter?

488
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:01,670
I'm sorry.

489
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,710
Fine.

490
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,809
If that's what you want,

491
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,549
let's live as strangers.

492
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,980
But not Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

493
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,630
Ji Seok.

494
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,269
I don't get it, no matter how hard
I try to understand.

495
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,380
- What would I lose?
- Hwang Jin Goo.

496
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:48,079
Ji Seok wouldn't say that
unless there was something...

497
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,789
between his sister and Jin Goo.

498
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:51,990
How dare you touch what's mine?

499
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,170
Hey. Goo Ha Na!

500
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:07,799
You and your brother are the same.

501
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,869
One of you ran into me with his car,

502
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,509
and the other hit me with her body,
then completely ignored me.

503
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,609
- What are you...
- Stop playing dumb.

504
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,180
You just hit my shoulder!

505
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,720
I'm sorry.

506
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,279
You little...

507
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,950
What the heck is
wrong with you and your brother?

508
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,160
You two are dirt poor,
yet why are you so arrogant?

509
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,319
Why are you so snooty?

510
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,289
You're so full of yourself.

511
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,200
Sure.

512
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,299
"Sure?"

513
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,440
You like the president, don't you?

514
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,380
Answer me.

515
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,420
I don't covet after what isn't mine.

516
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,150
How dare you try to play smart
and dodge the question?

517
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,589
I asked...

518
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,359
if you liked the president.

519
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,630
You like him, but he isn't yours,
so you won't covet after him?

520
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,160
Do you want me to like him?

521
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,700
- What?
- If not, why do you keep saying it?

522
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,599
So what if I do like him?

523
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,609
Will you use that
as an excuse to fire me?

524
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,210
Or will you break off
your engagement...

525
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,410
How dare you grab me?

526
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,380
What are you doing, Ms. Yoon?

527
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,809
(Cinderella Game)

528
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,710
You like Guide Goo Ha Na, don't you?
Since when?

529
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,680
Someone who likes you a lot
must've sent that.

530
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,779
Did you get a boyfriend?

531
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,519
Stay within the line from now on...

532
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,119
and try not to get dumped
by your fiancee.

533
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,119
- I want to study abroad.
- I want to start my business.

534
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,289
Ha Na, I love you!

535
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,930
And I also refuse your financial support
for my siblings.

536
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,460
Do you know anything
about Yoon Yu Jin?

537
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,869
Why don't you
stop your revenge here?

538
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:52,000
- Why do you keep picking a fight?
- You get on my nerves.

539
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,769
Are you sure
you can take Hyesung Group over?

540
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:55,910
How long will you stay patient?

541
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,339
I also look forward to finding out
what will happen...

542
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:59,609
when I run out of patience.
