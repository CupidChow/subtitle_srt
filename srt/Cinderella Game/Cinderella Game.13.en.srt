1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,209
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,109
Why would it go down?

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,619
It will happen soon.

6
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:12,580
So, you need to quit.

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,490
(Episode 13)

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,559
Is there a ground?

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,559
What's the reason?

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,059
Because I'll do it.

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,859
- You?
- Yes.

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,329
I plan to destroy Hyesung Tour.

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,129
Why would you do that?

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,640
I don't understand what you mean.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,939
There are
many other travel agencies.

16
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,880
- I'll find better terms for you...
- No, I'll work at Hyesung Tour.

17
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,049
I still got the job on my own,
even if it does go down.

18
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,479
If you pulled strings to get it,
you could just go somewhere else.

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,850
Everyone was talking about you,

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,649
pulling strings to get a job
even after doing an illegal gig.

21
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,119
Do you want to work here
despite all this talk?

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,020
It's true.

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,429
Pulling strings is
also a kind of talent.

24
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,859
If I got a job
by using a connection,

25
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,600
I should put up
with people talking in the back.

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:00,869
Ha Na.

27
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,370
I wasn't privileged enough
to quit my job here...

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,200
just because of people's talk.

29
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,239
Caring about people pointing fingers
and talking behind my back...

30
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,540
won't put food in my mouth.

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,109
I've spent enough time in this field
to adapt quickly,

32
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,379
so don't worry.

33
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,519
Hyesung Tour will never go down.

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,519
I won't let it.

35
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,060
- You shouldn't say that.
- Why not?

36
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,629
Because she is
the enemy of our parents.

37
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,430
This is the business...

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
of someone
who did this to our family.

39
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,439
She's a pretty girl.

40
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,480
I've had many agencies look for her,
but no one found any leads.

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,010
I want to resume my search.

42
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:50,980
I will begin
by searching children's homes...

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,950
near the area of her disappearance,
then continue countrywide.

44
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,890
Please do not leave out
any possibilities.

45
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,989
And reach out to us immediately
if you find someone...

46
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,390
who shares the tiniest resemblance.

47
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,290
Above all,
confidentiality is our priority.

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,730
- Do you not want anyone to know?
- No.

49
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,000
I haven't heard anything
for over five years,

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
so most people thought I gave up.

51
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,810
I was also worried
I might put her in danger...

52
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,580
even if I did find her
after all this trouble.

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,550
Yes, I understand.

54
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,020
I don't care
how much money it takes.

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
I'll still reward you...

56
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,349
even if you only manage
to confirm her life or death.

57
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,189
And if you find Yu Jin alive,

58
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,659
you will be rewarded
beyond your imagination.

59
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,169
Why do you want
to destroy Hyesung Tour?

60
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,939
At least tell me the reason.

61
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:48,710
Later.
I'll tell you everything later.

62
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,840
So, just trust me and do as I ask.

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,810
- Ji Seok.
- Will you or won't you?

64
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,819
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,319
I can't do that for you.

66
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,460
I can't quit my job
without a reason.

67
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,090
I'm only doing my job
just as you're doing yours.

68
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,030
If that's what you want,
I can't force you.

69
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,729
I guess we're on different journeys.

70
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,669
Will you help me understand
what you talking about?

71
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:19,800
You can do your job.

72
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,639
I'll do mine.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,580
I thought we came out
to enjoy dinner.

74
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,349
What's with this awkward situation?

75
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,680
I'll get sick
after eating this expensive meal.

76
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,990
You know Ji Eun is moving in with you
this weekend, right?

77
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,990
That girl is really excited.

78
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,430
You can take it.

79
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,069
I'm going to the restroom.

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,710
- Hello?
- President Hwang Jin Goo...

81
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,110
told the police he didn't think
Mr. Jung intended to harm anyone.

82
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,180
- That was unexpected.
- But he also won't show mercy...

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,050
or settle the case unless Mr. Jung shares
who's behind him.

84
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,090
All right.

85
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,259
Why does he want to destroy
Hyesung Tour?

86
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,180
Thank you.

87
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,560
How old are you?

88
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,389
Was I allowed to ask
for a lady's age?

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm 31 this year.

90
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,430
You're 31 years old?

91
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:58,699
Hey, Hyun Ju.

92
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,509
Excuse me.

93
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,480
She's the same age as Yu Jin.

94
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,089
Hyesung Tour will never go down.

95
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,829
I won't let it.

96
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,160
That fool doesn't know a thing.

97
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,370
Chairwoman Shin?

98
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,579
Ms. Chairwoman.

99
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,149
Hello, Mr. Goo.

100
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,750
How do you feel?

101
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,189
I heard you couldn't come to work.

102
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,589
I'm better now.

103
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,259
- I'll be at work tomorrow.
- I'm glad.

104
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,430
I was worried that the rampage...

105
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,899
at my appointment ceremony
might damage the group's image,

106
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,529
but you don't have to worry.

107
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,139
What's more important is
finding out who's behind him.

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,800
What a shame.

109
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,939
I intend to take action
after the investigation ends.

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,709
All right.
Then, you should get back to dinner.

111
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,680
Yes, goodbye.

112
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,759
"Find out who's behind him?"

113
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,889
The moment you do,
everything will fly back to you.

114
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,660
Anyway, why was she here?
It didn't seem to concern business.

115
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,100
Did you meet someone you knew?

116
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,300
Yes, let's go.

117
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,139
Okay.

118
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,589
You have a girlfriend
at the kindergarten, right?

119
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,459
Tell me her name.
I'll resolve your issue.

120
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,629
Did Ji Seok call you out
to say something weird?

121
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,629
Why did he want to meet you alone?

122
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,230
He must like me best.

123
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,910
- Isn't that so, Eun Chong?
- Yes, you're my favorite, too.

124
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,509
Me, too. You're my favorite, Ha Na.

125
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,279
- Don't be so gross.
- Why not?

126
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,350
- I won't get off you.
- What's wrong with Uncle Ji Chang?

127
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,079
Gosh, I'm sick of seeing this.

128
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,449
I need to hold out
just a little more.

129
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,860
I'd be freed from this house
very soon.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,730
You must've splurged again.

131
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,959
Have you paid
the living expenses this year?

132
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,569
You need to pay
your living expenses first...

133
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:45,269
as soon as you get paid
if you're human.

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,170
You say you're paying back
your student loan,

135
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,769
but you're always busy
adorning yourself.

136
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,610
Speak for yourself.

137
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,079
I'm doing a great job...

138
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,509
- at finding my own path.
- I heard...

139
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,480
you two went to see Lee Seok Ki.

140
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,350
How did you know?

141
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,189
- Did you meet that punk?
- I ran into him by chance.

142
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,319
Darn it. That petty jerk.

143
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,560
He should be grateful
it wasn't any worse.

144
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,860
How could he dare
to run to you and tell on us?

145
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,189
Thanks.

146
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:11,800
- What?
- You got my revenge.

147
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,269
It was hardly a revenge.

148
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,970
You, too, Ji Chang. Thank you.

149
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,699
You're welcome, Ha Na.

150
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,269
I want to thank you, too.

151
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,610
That was awesome,
Uncle Ji Chang and Auntie Ji Eun.

152
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,740
Is that so?

153
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,110
Yes, right.
What did you and Ji Seok eat?

154
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,779
- Steak.
- Darn it.

155
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,659
Later.
I'll tell you everything later.

156
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,230
So, just trust me and do as I ask.

157
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,799
Does this mean...

158
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,960
he can't share it now,
but he can tell me later?

159
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,399
What could it be?

160
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,639
He's not the type
who'll talk nonsense.

161
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,139
President Hwang Jin Goo
told the police...

162
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,610
he didn't think
Mr. Jung intended to harm anyone.

163
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,879
But he also won't show mercy
or settle the case...

164
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,649
unless Mr. Jung shares
who's behind him.

165
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,720
Are you here to see the chairwoman?

166
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,990
Well, yes.

167
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,590
If you're here to make a report,
you can talk to me first.

168
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:53,500
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

169
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,169
Please have a seat.
Would you like tea?

170
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm all right.

171
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,539
When you said
you had a knack for rebelling,

172
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,440
- you weren't lying.
- What do you mean?

173
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,409
We said you would report
Hyesung Tour's business through me.

174
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,649
It seemed like you were ignoring
the head director to his face.

175
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,649
I'm sorry. It was an emergency.

176
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,850
What's an emergency?

177
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,320
If losing a contract with a hotel
counts as an emergency,

178
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,629
what will you call a bigger crisis?

179
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,690
A hotel we partnered with
for a very long time...

180
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,100
canceled the contract
without a discussion...

181
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,960
at the expense
of paying the compensation.

182
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,230
I believe
their investor is behind this.

183
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,769
You believe Hanguk Hotel's investor
is behind the contract cancellation.

184
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,340
Do you have evidence?

185
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,580
I have circumstantial evidence.

186
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,549
Not that, but solid evidence.

187
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,580
You should
report it to the chairwoman first.

188
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,549
I need to find out who is and why
they are oppressing Hyesung Tour.

189
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:49,750
Bring me the evidence first.

190
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,559
Who'll take responsibility
if this gets out of hand...

191
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,059
after I report it to the chairwoman?

192
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,330
I will.

193
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,629
You overestimate yourself.

194
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,700
You aren't in a position
to take responsibility.

195
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,600
You are to follow
my orders and instructions.

196
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,509
Bring me the evidence.

197
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,480
I will take responsibility.

198
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:19,820
He told me to find evidence first,
that the investor pushed them.

199
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,389
You went to see the chairwoman
to find the evidence.

200
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,659
He doesn't even know
the order of things. How ridiculous.

201
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,490
He said he'd take responsibility,
so let's find the evidence.

202
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,830
We found ourselves a bossy boss.

203
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,659
Mom was right.

204
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,629
The new guy may
push out the old one.

205
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,100
- I won't get pushed out so easily.
- Of course not.

206
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,440
You're my man.

207
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,169
I'll show him what will happen
if he messes with my man.

208
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:43,710
Hey, I'm trying to work.
I don't want to pick a fight.

209
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,809
How are you going to fight
with that hand, anyway?

210
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,350
How long
do you have to keep that on?

211
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,750
I can use adhesive bandages
starting tomorrow.

212
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,559
We must punish that man severely
for doing this to you.

213
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:59,990
Why did you tell them
that he didn't intend to hurt you?

214
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,460
You fool.

215
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,330
The problem isn't my wound,
but who's behind him.

216
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,899
Why did he call her
a corporate raider?

217
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,830
I told you. There are people
who try to slander her.

218
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,299
Could it be someone on the inside?

219
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,470
Hey, Ms. Kim.

220
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,309
What is it?

221
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,909
"Enteritis?"

222
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,610
We don't have
any Chinese guides available.

223
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,409
One moment.

224
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,179
Ms. Yoon, Guide Kim Jin Kyung
has enteritis,

225
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,220
so we need to find a Chinese guide,
but everyone's schedule is full.

226
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,490
Find a way.

227
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,990
Make sure the guests don't notice.

228
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,659
Wait, Ms. Goo can do it, right?

229
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,399
It's harder than I thought
to sit around and get paid.

230
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,269
Ms. Goo, you have to go
to Deoksu Palace now.

231
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,340
Sorry? What is it, Mr. Yoon?

232
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,240
Guide Kim Jin Kyung
came down with enteritis.

233
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,179
It's dinner after one tour schedule,
so go to the hotel right after.

234
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,220
Yes, I'll do that!

235
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,379
- Let's go!
- You got this. Let's go.

236
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,250
What did you say?

237
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,759
There's no reservation?

238
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,360
No, ma'am.
I don't see any reservations.

239
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,190
That's impossible.
Can you check again?

240
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,500
There is no reservation.
Ask your office.

241
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,700
Ha Na, what are you talking about?

242
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,039
What do you mean, no reservation?

243
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,269
- What are you talking about?
- There's no hotel reservation.

244
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,340
- Give me that.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:27,080
President Hwang speaking.
Let me talk to the one in charge.

246
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,110
"Admin error?"

247
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,850
This wasn't the first day
we worked together.

248
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,580
I'll go to the hotel now.

(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

250
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,789
I had them cancel all reservations.

251
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,159
But the guide is Ms. Goo Ha Na.

252
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,200
Don't throw
personal issues into work.

253
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,070
Send out
the contract cancellation notice.

254
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,809
Is this how you handle
your business?

255
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,580
We do not see
any reservations on our system.

256
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,610
There must be a misunderstanding
with Hyesung Tour.

257
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,980
You're driving me crazy.

258
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,450
Then, give us
whatever room you have now.

259
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,720
We're fully booked,
so we have no rooms.

260
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,019
What are we going to do
with all those guests?

261
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,259
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,830
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,730
How much longer do we have to wait?

264
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,600
Hey, guide lady. We're tired.

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,399
I apologize.

266
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,440
There's a mishap with your rooms,
so we're handling that right now.

267
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,769
Please have some beverages
and wait a little more.

268
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,309
I apologize. I'm so sorry.

Director Goo.

271
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,500
There was an error
with room reservations.

272
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:55,730
The hotel must be mistaken,
so please find some rooms for us.

273
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,970
I doubt it was a mistake.

274
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,240
Then, what is it?

275
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,340
Ms. Yoon.

(Contract Cancellation Notice
To Hyesung Tour)

278
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:07,950
- Contract cancellation?
- The fax should be in by now.

279
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:10,809
What do you think you're doing?

280
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,850
Let's discuss the contract tomorrow.
You should find rooms first.

281
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,159
Talk to the hotel manager.

282
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,230
It's impossible
for there to be no rooms.

283
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,299
What do you think
you're doing, guide?

284
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,210
Head Director Goo Ji Seok,
I ask of you.

285
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,470
Please find some rooms for us.

286
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,210
There are none,
so find another hotel.

287
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,279
Was this what you meant?
Destroying Hyesung Tour?

288
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,450
Let go of me.

289
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,940
Contract cancellation?
You need to help me understand.

290
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,169
I said it in Korean.
Was it hard to get?

291
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,669
We are no longer partnering
with Hyesung Tour.

292
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,850
Why are you suddenly doing this?

293
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,149
Do you need to know that now?

294
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,080
Will you let the guests
spend the night there?

295
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,730
It's me.

at the Gana Hotel.

Excellent job.

322
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,769
We can take suites, too.

323
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,109
Did you say two?
Yes, we'll take those.

Yes, sir.

Yes, all right.

Ms. Yoon, we found
three rooms in the Gana Hotel.

327
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:59,619
That's north of the river.
We need something in the south.

328
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,880
We can't let them travel too far.

329
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,019
We don't have the luxury
of deciding the location.

330
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,720
Let's look for ten more minutes
and take those if we find nothing.

331

Mr. Hwang,
I found five rooms at the Liz Hotel.

332
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,359
I said we'd be there in 30 minutes.

333
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,430
Great job.

334
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,470
We have the rooms now.
Two hotels are five minutes away,

335
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,470
but one is north of the river,
so they'll have to travel far.

336
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,740

Everyone, I apologize
for making you wait so long.

There was a sudden water leak
in your rooms,

340
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,750
so we had to handle that first.

However, your safety was
our priority,

342
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,250

but to find other hotels for you.

What a tough day.

344
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,630
- What's with the complications?
- Yes, really.

345
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,170
He sent us the cancellation notice
without warning or talking to us.

346
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,609

sleep out on the street.

347
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,309
Wait, is he a psychopath?

348
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,880
Why is he acting so harshly
right after his appointment?

349
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,619
Yeo Jin, will you
just sit on your hands?

350
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:11,119
He made this decision
without saying a word to you.

351
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,160
It sounds like mutiny.

352
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,859
- Be quiet.
- I thought it was intentional.

353
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,859
I agree.

354
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,170
We shouldn't have let him
steal that position.

355
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,670
I'll have to talk to Mr. Goo first.

356
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:26,369
Make sure nothing gets out of hand
at the hotel and the travel agency.

357
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,839
All right.

358
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,210
Goodnight, Aunt Yeo Jin.

359
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,740
Goodnight, Yeo Jin.

360
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,950
He even said Jin Goo should
report to him, right?

361
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,250
He revealed his true colors
rather quickly.

362
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,359
Is he trying to get revenge...
My gosh!

363
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,960
Bang Ul, you were still here?

364
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,400
You told me to run the dryer
before I went home.

365
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,309
I folded the laundry,
so take those upstairs.

366
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,069
Mother, you should take a taxi.

367
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,369
I'll call one for you.

368
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,579
- I can take the bus.
- Just take the taxi.

369
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,720
Anyway, do you know
that head director?

370
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:14,519
How would we know him?

371
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,549
I just did some digging
to find out what he was like.

372
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,960
He turned out to be
a nasty piece of work.

373
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,759
Let's go, Mother.

374
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,529
Goodness, okay.

375
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,430
Bye, Bang Ul.

376
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,470
Should I meet him...

377
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,539
before things got out of hand?

378
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,509
Great work today.

379
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,380
You, too, Mr. Hwang.

380
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,849
Gosh, I'm so glad
the guests are so understanding.

381
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,690
Has this ever happened before?

382
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,720
No, it was my first time.

383
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,119
Hey, you seemed experienced
for a first-timer.

384
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,160
Well, you face all kinds of problems
when you work as a tour guide.

385
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,099
I'm used to taking action
against unexpected situations,

386
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,039
so I'm equipped
with quick responses.

387
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,140
That's great.

388
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,640
Well,

389
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,940
about Director Goo sending out
the cancellation notice...

390
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,240
Aren't you tired
of talking about work?

391
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,049
I'm hungry.

392
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,849
Right.

393
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,690
Hello.

394
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:31,160
- Excuse me. Two bowls of udon.
- Sure.

395
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,599
Give us huge servings!

396
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,799
Enjoy.

397
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,599
It looks so good.

398
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,440
Okay. Yes.

399
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,210
Why are you so happy?

400
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,680
When your wooden chopsticks
split up into perfect pieces,

401
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,910
it means good luck.

402
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,519
You should try, too.

403
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,819
I don't believe in those things.

404
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,430
- It must be the bandage.
- It can't be that hard.

405
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,829
These must be defective.

406
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,730
Experts never complain
about the tools.

407
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,569
There is no expertise
in splitting chopsticks.

408
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,579
I'll share my luck with you.

409
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,809
Thanks.

410
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,509
Does your hand feel okay?

411
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,849
Yes, I'll be fine
as long as I can use chopsticks.

412
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,500
Let's have another one.

413
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,970
Was this the meal
you offered to buy last time?

414
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,210
These aren't expensive,

415
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,880
so I'll treat you again next time.

416
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,049
Thank you very much.

417
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,750
Excuse me, one more udon, please.

418
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,829
- I need to go on a diet.
- Start tomorrow.

419
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,829
You should eat today.

420
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,200
This seemed like
the first job you had.

421
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,730
It'll take Ms. Yoon some time
to put her trust in you.

422
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,569
- Hang in there.
- Okay.

423
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:21,940
I understand her, though.

424
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,809
We already had such a long history.

425
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,680
And with you, too.

426
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,809
But thank you...

427
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,980
for treating me without prejudice.

428
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,680
I didn't help out much.

429
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,490
No way. It's helpful to have you
stand there, just like today.

430
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,420
We're on the same side,
so it feels reassuring.

431
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,859
"The same side?"
Wasn't that what I said?

432
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:43,930
You're right.

433
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,000
"We're on the same side."

434
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,269
I liked that.

435
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,269
If you like that, let's continue
to be on the same side.

436
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,269
Okay.

437
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,940
We are no longer partnering
with Hyesung Tour.

438
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,349
I'll take a fine
if you think about work while eating.

439
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,390
Why do you think
Hyesung Hotel is doing this?

440
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,690
Should we begin at ten dollars?

441
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,359
Fine, I'll stop. Goodness.

442
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,730
I'll talk to Director Goo.

443
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,099
But you don't need
to feel responsible, Ms. Goo.

444
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:28,470
Wait, you knew
he was my younger brother.

445
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,640
Here's my fine.

446
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,750
- Let's pay for udon.
- Udon it is.

447
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,500
(1. I will walk your dog
for 50 cents an hour.)

448
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yes.

449
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,759
It's you, right?
Ms. Goo Ha Na's nephew.

450
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,799
Yes. Hello, President Hwang Jin Goo.

451
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:31,900
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

452
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,240
No, I'm fine.

453
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,309
It's dangerous
to run around in an alley.

454
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,609
- Look around carefully and walk.
- Okay.

455
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,410
One second.

456
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,420
What's this? Did you write this?

457
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,720
Mr. Hwang,
do you want to clean your shoes?

458
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:49,990
Do you need money?

459
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,450
Is there something you want to buy?

460
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:54,190
No, but if you need me,
you can call me.

461
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,190
I offer services
that are not on the list.

462
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:58,559
Recycling and folding laundry.

463
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:02,599
But keep it a secret from my auntie.

464
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,269
You should get in.
I'll take you back home.

465
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,769
My auntie needs to repay her debt.

466
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:11,039
"Debt?" How much is it?
And why are you paying it off?

467
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,210
I just need 10 50-cent coins.

468
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,279
You need 10 50-cent coins?
So, 5 dollars?

469
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,259
Let's say you cleaned my shoes.

470
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,960
I don't take free money.

471
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,769
You can take it from me.

472
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:38,299
Call me
when you want to clean your shoes.

473
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,539
I'll make them shiny and clean.

474
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,910
Stay there.

475
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,000
Thank you for the ride.

476
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,529
Mr. Hwang, please keep this a secret
from my auntie.

477
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,839
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

478
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,910
She's five dollars in debt?

479
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,420
Where have you been?

480
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,650
Right outside.

481
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,660
Are you that happy
to betray us and move out?

482
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,759
You're gleaming.

483
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,890
I love the fact
I won't have to see you.

484
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:41,059
You must be happy
now that the nagger is gone.

485
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,630
Make sure Ji Seok eats well.

486
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,829
I'll make some side dishes
and visit on the weekend.

487
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,140
I never cook, but I can be good
if I set my mind to it.

488
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,740
Please do that.

489
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,039
What are you looking at?

490
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,349
That little kid has a way
of making me concerned.

491
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,380
Bye. You don't have to come out.

492
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,420
- Give me that.
- Bye.

493
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:11,289
She's totally excited. Traitor.

494
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,559
Uncle Ji Chang,
don't you want to go, too?

495
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,599
What?

496
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you want me to go?

497
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,000
Do you want to live alone
with Auntie Ha Na?

498
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,009
You're a sly little punk.

499
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,049
He seems suspicious.

500
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,650
I'm here, Ji Seok.

501
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,450
I'll go upstairs.

502
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,930
It's a great location, right?
It's not so bad.

503
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,059
Yes.

504
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,200
My gosh. I love it!

505
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,769
This must be latex.

506
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,170
I love how bouncy it is.

507
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,579
I'm glad you like it.

508
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,109
Yes, I'm so happy.

509
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,279
Do you know who I'm thinking of?

510
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,519
Our poor mom and dad.

511
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,049
A house like this...

512
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,359
wouldn't have been a problem
if they were still alive.

513
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,589
I'll set everything back in order.

514
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,829
I'll also do...

515
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,900
Mom and Dad's part.

516
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,630
I'm about to cry.

517
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,970
This is just the beginning.
It's too early to cry.

518
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,339
Okay, Ji Seok.

519
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,839
Did Ha Na say anything?

520
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,440
She told me
to take good care of you.

521
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,950
She'll visit us next weekend
with some side dishes.

522
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,450
Right, Ji Seok.

523
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,750
Are you really canceling
the contract with Hyesung Tour?

524
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,420
Why?

525
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:55,799
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

526
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,369
You believe Hanguk Hotel's investor
is behind the contract cancellation.

527
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,640
Do you have evidence?

528
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,940
Bring me the evidence.

529
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,210
I will take responsibility.

530
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,549
Contract cancellation?
You need to help me understand.

531
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,880
I said it in Korean.
Was it hard to get?

532
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,779
We are no longer partnering
with Hyesung Tour.

533
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,920
As soon as Hanguk Hotel
canceled our contract,

534
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,960
he quickly moved on to Hyesung Hotel
as if he had been waiting.

535
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,990
If this was done
by the same investor,

536
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:28,670
could it be Goo Ji Seok's sponsor,
Richard Han?

537
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,299
Is there anything
you want to change?

538
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,539
Not really.

539
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,670
Let's put up
a few more paintings on the wall.

540
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,710
You're starting to sound
like Jin Goo.

541
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,480
You need to seize the chance
when I offer to do these things.

542
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,009
He sat around waiting...

543
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,720
and lost his chance
to be the head director.

544
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm going to meet that punk.

545
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,289
Don't. I have another card to play.

546
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,230
- What is it?
- There's an eyesore.

547
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,930
Who?

548
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,329
Ji Seok's older sister.

549
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,299
Wait!

550
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,710
Please take another elevator.

551
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,509
It's all right. Get in.

552
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,539
Right. Thank you.

553
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,190
Wait, we met
at the restaurant, right?

554
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,960
Do you work for Hyesung Tour?

555
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,700
Yes.

556
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,900
Can you recommend
a place to travel to?

557
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,200
Who are you traveling with?

558
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,869
Alone.

559
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,910
Where could a lonely
and melancholic person go?

560
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,680
If you felt lonely and melancholic,

561
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,950
wouldn't it be better
to spend time...

562
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,319
with your family and friends
instead of traveling?

563
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:02,859
Should you say that
as an employee of a travel agency?

564
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,859
I didn't mean you shouldn't travel.

565
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,359
The meal may be the same,

566
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,269
but something that tastes
just all right alone...

567
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,839
somehow tastes oddly delicious
when you share it...

568
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,369
with your family or friends.

569
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,339
You don't feel so empty anymore.

570
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,109
So, I hope you visit...

571
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,950
a nice place with people you like.

572
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,950
Can you give me a business card?

573
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:30,720
Of course.

574
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,089
Wait, please don't tell my agency
everything I just said.

575
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,430
Tour Guide Goo Ha Na?

576
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,769
Yes.

577
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,539
Then, I hope you have a great trip.

578
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,920
(Cinderella Game)

579
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,049
Your brother just ruined
your workplace.

580
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,259
How does it feel?

581
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,759
Keep your emotions under control.
Someone might catch you.

582
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,029
What's going on, everyone?

583
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:44,529
Did something happen to Eun Chong?

584
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:46,960
I saw the chairwoman
meeting someone discreetly...

585
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,130
out of the office.

586
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,930
She must've been
digging your back...

587
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,630
or doing something
about her lost daughter.

588
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,240
He made it too easy to notice
someone was behind him.

589
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,839
Do you want to bet?
I'll bet my presidency of Hyesung Tour.

590
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,210
I'm in.
