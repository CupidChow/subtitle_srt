1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,350
I gave him my full support
to this day,

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,520
just like I would to my son.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,020
So, I felt betrayed
when he said he'd leave me...

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,390
when I was the most troubled.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,620
Betrayal? Not at all.
That's far from the truth.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,860
Of course not. He wouldn't do that.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,530
No.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,300
Then, can you talk to him...

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,540
and tell him to stay by my side?

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,440
Both you and Jin Goo said...

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,240
you'd pay back my kindness
for the rest of your lives.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,940
I hope those weren't
just empty words.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,650
Of course not.

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,980
Jin Goo wouldn't be here today
if it hadn't been for me.

18
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,120
You gave him birth,

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,090
but I kept him alive until now.

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,360
Can you promise me...

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,260
that you'll make him stay
by my side?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,900
You owe me that much.

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,970
You must repay me
for my kindness, Ms. Sim.

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,310
What did you just say to my mother?

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,850
- Jin Goo.
- Mom, you need to leave.

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,220
- You may leave.
- Okay.

27
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,300
If you have anything to say,
you can talk to me.

28
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,200
Stop blackmailing my mom.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,430
- "Blackmailing?"
- What do you want?

30
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,070
Your protection.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,510
You need to save me,
just as how I saved you.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,280
Eun Chong will be exposed
if the public finds out...

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,750
about the fake daughter project.

34
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,280
I need you...

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,320
to take responsibility
for appropriating company funds.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
That's how you can save
me and Eun Chong.

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,830
Did you call my mom
to tell her that and blackmail her?

38
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,160
I was asking for a favor.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,000
You thought I wouldn't listen,
so you called her instead!

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,800
I would've told you directly
if you were like before.

41
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,800
You've changed lately.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,340
You're trying to leave me.

43
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,840
I don't care about the reason.

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,840
How can you tell my mom
that you were the one...

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,480
who kept me alive?

46
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,680
Have you considered
how she'd feel...

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,090
Well, I guess
how other people feel...

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,190
isn't important to you.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,520
Mind your language.

50
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,330
What did I do so wrong
to you and your mother?

51
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,460
You didn't have to say that
to my mom.

52
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,900
I would've listened if you asked me.

53
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,640
I'll do as you wish.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,500
But...

55
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,470
you must let me and my mom go.

56
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,710
What did Yeo Jin say?

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,250
I'm asking you. What did she say?

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,490
Are you ignoring me right now?

59
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,830
We're no longer in a relationship
to make small talk.

60
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,230
Stop talking to me.

61
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,100
I wasn't asking how you were doing.

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,100
- What did Yeo Jin say...
- I watched that video...

63
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,970
on Se Young's impressive power trip.

64
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,700
I'm so glad
the wedding was called off.

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,740
Otherwise, Jin Goo would've suffered
from her abuse.

66
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,640
I believe...

67
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,010
my mom and I have done
our best for you to this day.

68
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,020
I am grateful
that you saved me from my illness.

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,250
But my mom isn't a sinner.

70
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,260
I didn't treat her like a sinner.

71
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,420
I wasn't even making things up.

72
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,330
I just wanted to ask her for help.

73
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,990
It wasn't just you two
who gave your best.

74
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,130
I also gave my best
for you and your mother.

75
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,830
Yes, you were always nice to us.

76
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,000
We were always grateful.

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,810
So, have you considered
why I wanted to leave you...

78
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,670
and stand on my own feet?

79
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,110
I knew you were disappointed
after what I did to Ha Na.

80
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,110
But I was also heartbroken
to see you...

81
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,250
trying to cut our ties that easily.

82
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,020
I've known you for 20 years,

83
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,090
but I still don't know who you are.

84
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,630
I'll deal with the audit result
no matter what the conclusion is.

85
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,800
That is the last thing...

86
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,170
I can do for you.

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,970
And from now on,

88
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,800
don't tell my mom
to come and go as you like.

89
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,710
Let me leave you
with one last thing.

90
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,150
Apologize to Ha Na's family.

91
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,180
That's the only way
you can stop a worse tragedy.

92
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,020
Please do that.

93
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,290
Take good care of yourself.

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,940
Don't you know
how much I've done for you?

95
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,510
What did you
and the chairwoman talk about?

96
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,650
The business is under audit now,

97
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,420
so she told me to handle problems
if they should arise.

98
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,890
Did she tell you to take responsibility
for the problems?

99
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,090
No.

100
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,760
Mom, I told you last time...

101
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,730
that I'd leave her.

102
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,000
But she said
she wanted to keep you by her side.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,330
I already declined.

104
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,800
She and I will each go our way
from now on.

105
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,840
But still, she was our savior.

106
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,300
Cutting her off that coldly...

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,170
I have to do that
to keep the distance.

108
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,180
And don't go over there
whenever she asks you to come.

109
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,180
All right.

110
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,650
Don't just say it.

111
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,680
I get it.

112
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,590
Anyway, an audit sounds scary.

113
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,860
You won't have to deal
with anything big, will you?

114
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,070
There's only one thing
I want to change...

115
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,910
if I could go back in time.

116
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,340
I want to notice my feelings
much faster.

117
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,540
And I'd be honest with her...

118
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,110
about the lies I told...

119
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,620
and my feelings.

120
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,250
I want to apologize to her
for the rest of my life,

121
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,260
right by her side.

122
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,890
It was like making a love confession
during an audit.

123
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,300
He heard the conversation
Chairwoman Shin had with us,

124
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,370
so he would've realized
who she really was.

125
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,050
Will he help me?

126
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,090
The disciplinary committee will
sue and report Jin Goo?

127
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,060
Yes, if he returns
the embezzled amount...

128
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,830
and settles the case
with the company,

129
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,800
he'll only be put on probation.

130
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,370
Please do that.

131
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,740
Will you cut ties with Mr. Hwang?

132
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,080
I want to keep him in my life,
but I don't think he wants to stay.

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,820
He once said he wanted to leave
and stand on his feet.

134
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,850
I'm glad
I got a good use out of him...

135
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,590
during the most adequate time.

136
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,330
She's using Hwang Jin Goo
as a scapegoat.

137
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,300
How long will he act
like her loyal pet dog?

138
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,230
I didn't expect her
to do this to Mr. Hwang, too.

139
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,070
I thought
she considered him like her own.

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,940
She won't have
anyone left in her life...

141
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,540
if she continues
to cut people off from her life.

142
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,510
Mr. Han, are you worried
about Chairwoman Shin right now?

143
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,750
No, I was just wondering
why anyone would live like that.

144
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,250
Right, how's the preparation going
for the founding anniversary?

145
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,690
They're currently making a video
to promote the chairwoman's image.

146
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,930
I'll touch up the video.

147
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,360
Did you get interviews
with her victims?

148
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,960
Yes, I'm almost done.

149
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,870
The password has four letters,

150
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,440
including the alphabet,
so it's harder to get through.

151
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,300
We're only days away
from the founding anniversary.

152
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,280
I'll ask Mr. Hwang.

153
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,180
Did the police investigation
go well?

154
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Yes.

155
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,750
Did she tell you...

156
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,060
to take responsibility
for everything?

157
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,160
She can't just make me do it.

158
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,160
I said I'd do it.

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,960
If this is your revenge,
I deserve to be punished, too.

160
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,470
It's a punishment for me.
I'm not doing it for her.

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,340
You finally know
what her true nature is.

162
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,470
How did you feel?

163
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,270
I was in shock.

164
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,640
Would you have preferred
to stay in the dark?

165
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,480
No, it was belated,
but I had to know.

166
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,750
I also understand why...

167
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,580
you and Mr. Goo are out
to get revenge...

168
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,020
and that the chairwoman must
apologize and ask for forgiveness.

169
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,590
But I know she cannot be persuaded.

170
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,130
Have you talked to her?

171
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,760
I told her
to apologize to your family.

172
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,000
But I didn't get an answer.

173
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,700
How's the revenge coming along?

174
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,080
There's crucial evidence
on her security server,

175
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,180
but I can't get to it
without the password.

176
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,780
What's the crucial evidence?

177
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,950
The loan contract my dad signed...

178
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,550
with Hyesung Finance...

179
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,590
and files from the time
his business was sold off.

180
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,960
Do you plan to find those
and sue her?

181
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,190
Yes.

182
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,260
I need to know the password,

183
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,200
so do you think there will be a way?

184
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,370
Only the chairwoman knows that.

185
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,130
And I believe
she changes it periodically.

186
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
You don't even know any hints?

187
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,310
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

188
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,850
Someone like you
couldn't attack Chairwoman Shin.

189
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,120
She was like a mother to you,
and she saved your life.

190
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,390
- It'd be like betrayal.
- Yes.

191
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,260
That's who I am.

192
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,900
I can't even dream
of betraying anyone.

193
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,700
All right.
I won't bring it up anymore.

194
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,040
This is it.

195
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,140
I already knew,
but my aunt could be really scary.

196
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,580
You're right.

197
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,980
I didn't expect her to throw
Hwang Jin Goo under the bus.

198
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,290
You should be careful, too.

199
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,020
Jin Goo and I aren't the same.

200
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,990
He's a servant, but I'm her niece.

201
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,080
Is the preparation going well
for the founding anniversary?

202
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,440
Yes, we're almost done
with the PR video.

203
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
I'll do the final check.

204
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,250
Send it to me when you're done.

205
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,150
Okay.

206
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,120
Was that audit
the end of your revenge?

207
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,160
It was kind of boring.

208
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,490
I didn't suffer much,

209
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,590
and Aunt Yeo Jin
put the blame on Jin Goo.

210
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,660
After all,
did this only hurt Hwang Jin Goo?

211
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,430
Right?

212
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,880
What was that?

213
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,550
Did she just take my photo?

214
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,360
I'm sorry to ask,
but did you take our pictures?

215
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,170
No, I didn't.

216
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,300
May I check?

217
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,840
I didn't take any pictures.

218
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,870
Babe.

219
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,640
You seemed to be having fun
with Ms. Power Trip.

220
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,680
Just let it go.

221
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,280
Give it back.

222
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,590
What will you do
if I find our picture on here?

223
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,390
Tell me
before I'm done counting to three.

224
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,330
One. Two.

225
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,760
Three.

226
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,670
Oh, no.

227
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,100
My gosh. No.

228
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,510
Darn it. My phone.

229
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,440
Darn it.

230
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,650
Sue me if you want to.

231
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,110
I'll counter it.

232
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,420
Darn it.

233
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,620
This is just awful.

234
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,390
- Babe, look at my phone.
- Let's go.

235
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,460
Okay.

236
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,690
This is so annoying.

237
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,140
An English camp?

238
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,370
Yes, and we'll make campfires, too.

239
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,310
That sounds fun.

240
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,910
Why don't you study English hard...

241
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,440
and talk to me in English?

242
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,710
Okay. When are we going to meet?

243
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,080
Can we meet
when I return from the camp?

244
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,490
I miss you, too,

245
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,220
but my work isn't over yet.

246
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,420
How much longer do I have to wait?

247
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,690
It won't take long.

248
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,000
Will there ever come a day...

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,970
when we laugh, talk,
and live together in peace?

250
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,270
Eun Chong, let me call you back.

251
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,010
Okay.

252
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,180
Hello? Yes, Reverend Mother.

253
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,010
Right now?

254
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,090
I was so shocked to hear
that Eun Chong was...

255
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,560
Hyesung Group's grandson.

256
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,530
Me, too.

257
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,100
You won't have to worry
about him anymore.

258
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,200
It would've been great
if Du Na was still with us.

259
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,120
I came here to tell my friends
about your business.

260
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,750
That was why I asked them
to meet here.

261
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm giving you business,
yet you still don't like me?

262
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,530
No, I don't like you.

263
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,270
How did
Jin Goo's police investigation go?

264
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,100
"Police investigation?"

265
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,710
- Instead of the chairwoman, he...
- What?

266
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,240
He was investigated by the police
instead of the chairwoman?

267
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,450
Why are you snapping?

268
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,150
Of course,
he must sacrifice himself for her.

269
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,260
Oh, my.

270
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,090
Sorry.

271
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,600
That woman is...

272
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,740
By any chance, was it her?

273
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,010
All of a sudden?

274
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,260
Goodness.

275
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,120
Reverend Mother.

276
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,460
Let me bring you a new dish.

277
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,530
That woman...

278
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,870
That's Se Young's mom.

279
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,640
Do you know her?

280
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,310
She seems familiar.

281
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,310
She's Eun Chong's little grandma.

282
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,450
"Little grandma?"

283
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,550
So, she's Du Na's aunt?

284
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,220
Yes.

285
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,290
Ms. Sim is here.

286
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,600
Why is she here?

287
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,830
Let her in.

288
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,050
How may I help you?

289
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,280
I heard you had
Jin Goo investigated by the police.

290
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,590
How can you frame him
for something you did...

291
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,760
and send him to the police?

292
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,730
- Have a seat.
- No.

293
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,930
Jin Goo can do that much for me.

294
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,300
Everything is ready to make sure
he isn't detained,

295
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,370
so don't worry.

296
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,770
It's not a matter
of getting locked up in prison.

297
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,170
You claim to have considered him
as your own and adored him.

298
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,410
But no parent would send
their son to the police...

299
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,540
by framing him for their parent's crime.

300
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,080
Was that why you asked me
to convince Jin Goo to stay?

301
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,950
These things often happen
when you work in the real world.

302
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,690
He knew everything
and volunteered to do it.

303
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,520
I hope there's no misunderstanding.

304
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,220
He's very dear to me, too.

305
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,490
Why do you wish
to keep him in your life?

306
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,300
To take advantage of him whenever
something like this happens?

307
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,970
Have you
treated him like this all along?

308
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,570
- Ms. Sim.
- Ms. Sim.

309
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,840
Please calm down and have a seat.

310
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,170
I may not be well-off,

311
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,180
and Jin Goo may owe his life to you,
but this is just wrong.

312
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,980
I was already heartbroken
that he was born weak...

313
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,250
because of us, his parents.

314
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,120
But how can you do this every time
like he's your hostage?

315
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,990
How can you treat him
like a servant?

316
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,050
"Like a servant?"

317
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,660
- That's strong language.
- Yes, I'll use strong language.

318
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,230
I treated you
like you were my savior,

319
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,660
but I was still happy.

320
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,030
I was happy and grateful...

321
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,870
while I worked here as your maid.

322
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,640
I was glad
I could do something for you.

323
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,410
But I will not allow you to treat
Jin Goo like he's insignificant.

324
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,640
It's a misunderstanding.

325
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,410
I wouldn't have kept him in my life
if I thought he was insignificant.

326
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,950
Jin Goo said he'd leave you,

327
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,450
and I told him to do it.

328
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,420
Thank you for everything.

329
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,400
When did you get here?

330
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,230
I didn't see you at the restaurant.

331
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,330
Take care.

332
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,940
Why was she here?

333
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,540
- Did you tell her?
- Tell her what?

334
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,890
Did she come here to get mad
about Jin Goo's investigation?

335
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,160
Yes.

336
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,690
Why would she run here
over something like that?

337
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,900
You're back.

338
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,070
How did the police investigation go?

339
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,980
How did you know?

340
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,310
I am greatly hurt
and disappointed by the chairwoman.

341
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,920
How can she make you do this?

342
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,050
I wanted to help her one last time.

343
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,290
It'll go well, so don't worry.

344
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,760
What do you mean, it'll go well?

345
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,900
Will you be happy
as long as you avoid the prison?

346
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,900
Why are you so naive?
What's with you?

347
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,030
Mom.

348
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,540
I just don't understand.

349
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,670
The one who committed the crime
should be punished.

350
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,610
Why is she framing you?

351
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,780
How can she do that as an elder?

352
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,110
That's how things work in companies.

353
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,850
That's why you want to leave her.

354
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,480
You couldn't
put up with her anymore.

355
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,450
I'm the real sinner.

356
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,030
I put you on her leash
with your life as the collateral.

357
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,730
Mom, you're
taking this too far again.

358
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm fine. Nothing will happen.

359
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,900
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,880
Goodness, who turned my mom
into a crybaby?

361
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,120
You owe me that much.

362
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,230
You must repay me
for my kindness, Ms. Sim.

363
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,960
I need your protection.

364
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,100
You need to save me,
just as how I saved you.

365
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,940
Where's the chairwoman
I once admired and trusted?

366
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,470
Was this who you really were?

367
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,340
Then, just as Mr. Yoon said,

368
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,020
I should change for your sake.

369
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,250
I know everything now.

370
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,250
I can't turn
a blind eye to it forever.

371
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,140
- I'll wear this.
- Yes, ma'am.

372
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,240
Was that the end
of the Goo siblings' revenge?

373
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,980
- Things are quiet, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

374
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,820
(Incoming Call)

375
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,150
It must be him.

376
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,320
Was this the first time...

377
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,690
- he reached out after that day?
- Yes.

378
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,690
The person you have reached...

379
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,080
Yeo Jin, it's not too late
to change your mind.

380
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,550
Please reconcile
with the Goo siblings. I beg you.

381
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,020
You're asking me
to apologize and reconcile?

382
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,590
How ridiculous.

383
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,620
If he had to beg me on the phone,

384
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
it meant they couldn't find
crucial evidence.

385
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,130
- Hwang Jin Goo hasn't called yet?
- No.

386
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,970
We couldn't find the password,

387
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,570
and the hacking attempts
were useless.

388
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,310
We still have time until tomorrow.

389
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,970
Let's do this until the end.

390
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,140
- Yes.
- Okay.

391
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,810
After Chairwoman Shin's speech,
they'll play a commemorative video.

392
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,750
- Danny, check the video once again.
- Okay.

393
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,590
Mr. Han and I will
go through the files again.

394
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,560
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

395
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,830
Really?

396
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,680
What are Ji Seok and Ha Na up to?
They're always together.

397
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,550
How would I know if you don't?

398
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,520
But still, I'm not worried.

399
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,720
They aren't troublemakers like us.

400
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,220
Hey, I got involved because of you.

401
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,020
I've only seen loan sharks on TV.

402
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,190
I never expected to see them
with my own eyes.

403
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,490
Let's think of it as a good lesson.

404
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,360
But thanks to Ji Seok and Ha Na,

405
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,500
I got to keep the business...

406
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,600
- and my legs.
- You're right.

407
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,300
Let's call them up
and get together sometime.

408
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,770
That sounds great.

409
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,680
But it's a shame
Eun Chong can't join us.

410
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,580
Mr. Goo, another order
of cheese tteokbokki for table two.

411
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,650
Yes, okay.

412
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,860
It feels heavy to think
I must betray the chairwoman.

413
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,760
But I believe the chairwoman...

414
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,400
must be punished and apologize...

415
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,840
to break this vicious cycle
and turn everything back.

416
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,410
I'll help with your revenge.

417
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,580
Thank you for making
such a tough decision.

418
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,950
Let's just go for it.

419
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,250
You said you needed a password.

420
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,650
- Did you bring your laptop?
- Yes.

421
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,920
The server gets locked
after ten wrong attempts.

422
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,520
We tried 6 times,
so we have 4 more chances.

423
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,830
I know the passwords
she used in the past.

424
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,030
But it's most likely
she has changed it.

425
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,260
But let me try it, just in case.

426
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,630
I hope one of them is correct.

427
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,390
We have two more chances left.

428
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,600
Is there something she always does
when she makes passwords?

429
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,570
She often uses
something meaningful to her...

430
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,100
or makes abbreviations.

431
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,940
Something meaningful?

432
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,170
The most significant thing
in her life now must be Eun Chong.

433
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,480
Right?

434
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,150
Wait, could it be that?

435
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,210

You remembered who this woman was?

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,250
Yes.

448
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,050
- I heard she was Du Na's aunt.
- Yes.

449
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,890
When I saw her and heard her voice,

450
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,420
my old memories came back.

451
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,190
- Have you seen this woman?
- Yes.

452
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,190
I ran into her by chance
when I was eating out with Ha Na.

453
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,700
It was her.

454
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,130
She visited the children's home
around when Du Na was adopted...

455
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,200
and emigrated to America.

456
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,170
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

457
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,610
She mentioned Du Na
and seemed interested in adoption,

458
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,380
so I didn't think
she was someone who knew her.

459
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,810
Then, this woman knew...

460
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,150
Yu Jin was adopted
and emigrated to America?

461
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,350
Yes.

The beginning of Hyesung Group
goes back to the year 1995.

479

In the heart of busy Seoul in 1995,

480

Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin's
big dream began to dawn.

481
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,170
Hyesung Finance, the predecessor
of what is now Hyesung Group,

482
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,040
did not have a promising start.

483
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,680
However, Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin's
diligence and perseverance...

484

Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin's
corporate raiding...

487
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,220
ruined my business instantly,
the one I worked all my life...

488

to cultivate.

490

but Chairwoman Shin
did not show any remorse.

491
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,500
She still continues with
her corporate raiding endeavors.

492
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,700
- Shin, the corporate raider,
- What's going on?

493
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,400
- must step down on her own accord.
- Who did this?

494
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
- She ruined many companies...
- Goodness.

495
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,770
and made the victims shed
tears of blood.

496
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,780
I cannot stand to see her live
a comfortable life anymore.

497
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,880
- Turn it off right now!
- Youngshin Fashion is a company...

498
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,380
- ruined by her raid 13 years ago.
- Turn it off!

499

- Hyesung Finance...
- Hurry up and turn it off.

500
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,780
wanted to cause
Youngshin Fashion's bankruptcy.

501
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,750
- Turn it off now!
- It increased the interest rate...

502
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,320
and pressured CEO Goo Young Min
to recover the loan he took out.

503

at an unimaginably low price...

of its assets illegally.

through a recent external audit...

that her illegal activities
included...

518

insider trading, tax evasion,
and accounting manipulation.

what she did 13 years ago...

526
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,530
You should get the criminal first.

(Hyesung Group's
30th Founding Anniversary)

528
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin?

529
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,560
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin,
as of this hour,

530
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,930
you are under emergency arrest
for violating the Capital Markets Act.

531
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,470
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

532
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
and choose to remain silent.

533
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,770
Let go of me.

534
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,340
How dare you do this
without evidence?

535
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,670
You can't lay a finger on me...

536
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,540
even if you bring
hundreds of those reports.

537
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,680
Bring me the decisive evidence.

538
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,920
Here's the decisive evidence.

539
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,330
(Request of Compulsory Auction
of Real Estate Property)

540
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,130
How did you get this?

541
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,400
Admit to everything,
just as you promised.

542
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,830
Ms. Shin Yeo Jin,
the corporate raider.

543
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,430
(Cinderella Game)

544
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,060
You and Se Young are
the only ones left in my life.

545
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,430
It's the same for us, Yeo Jin.

546
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,000
It's something important
about your daughter.

547
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,300
You need to meet Mr. Yoon soon.

548
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,640
Eun Chong may fall into danger.

549
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,670
I have a bad feeling about this.

550
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,540
We cannot let them meet.

551
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,640
What kind of awful situation
is this?

552
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,140
She wasn't just repaying
kindness with evil.

553
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,350
She knew everything,
yet she kept it from me?

554
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,850
There's a possibility...

555
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,420
Myung Ji was involved
in Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident.

556
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,190
How much compensation do you expect?

557
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,820
A hundred million dollars
sounds reasonable.
