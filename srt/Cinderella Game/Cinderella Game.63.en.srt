1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,309
(Episode 63)

5
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,550
I'm going to live in my home
from now on.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,419
You can decide
if you'll live here with Grandma...

7
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:15,720
or if you'll live with me.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,760
Auntie Ha Na...

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,329
You can do as you want, Eun Chong.

10
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,699
Of course, he'd go with his aunt.

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,699
What were you thinking?

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,469
You want to live with me, right?

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,030
Come with me.

14
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,719
I want to live here.

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,920
Eun Chong.

16
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,789
You want to live here?

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,090
Yes, I'll live with Grandma.

18
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,990
Eun Chong,

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,759
do you really want
to live here with Grandma?

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,599
We can all live together
after Auntie Ha Na gets married.

21
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,569
You should hang on until then
for her sake, okay?

22
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,819
I found my grandma,
so I wanted to live with her.

23
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,219
I told him that
I was his grandmother.

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,760
Yes, it only makes sense
for you to live with your grandma.

25
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,090
Did you think of this
all by yourself?

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,400
Did anyone make you say this?

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,530
Who would make him say this?

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,269
Eun Chong, you should
think about this again.

29
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,739
Do you really want to live here?

30
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,439
But I want to live with you,
Eun Chong.

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,849
Come with me.

32
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,719
He says he wants to live here.

33
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,489
Auntie Ha Na...

34
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,290
I'll talk to her.

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,189
- You can go with Little Grandma.
- Yes, Eun Chong. Let's go upstairs.

36
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,060
- Auntie Ha Na...
- Come with me. Now.

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,129
Eun Chong...

38
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,270
Let's go upstairs.

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,500
What did you say to him?

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,210
What did you tell him
to make him say he'd live here?

41
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,840
Let's talk inside.

42
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,550
He'd never say
he wanted to live here.

43
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,560
Is it hard to believe
even after hearing it yourself?

44
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,430
He was no longer the same child
as the one who lived with you.

45
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,259
He's the future successor
of Hyesung Group.

46
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,370
His world will be
drastically different from now on.

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,639
He'd face danger all around
if he became known as my grandson.

48
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,069
Who'd be responsible for his safety
if he lived with you?

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,409
You couldn't stand by him
around the clock.

50
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:55,379
Even if you did,
how would you keep him safe?

51
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,689
What do you think
you can do for him from now on?

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,689
The only thing
you can do for him is...

53
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,330
distancing yourself
from this day on.

54
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,530
Distance myself?

55
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,530
It'd be even better
if you cut ties with him.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,300
He'll only have trouble adapting
if you keep in touch with him.

57
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,969
Was that why you stopped me
from making a phone call?

58
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,740
You refused my offers first.

59
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,740
You left because you didn't want to be
my daughter or Eun Chong's mom.

60
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,710
You should've seen this coming.

61
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,580
You're his grandmother.

62
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,710
Have you considered
how deeply he'd be hurt?

63
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,250
How can you do this to him, too?

64
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,889
You're awful.

65
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,319
You were the one
who made me act this awful.

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,460
I'd like to ask Du Na...

67
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,659
what I should do right now.

68
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,800
Yu Jin would tell you
to do as I said.

69
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,610
That's the best move
for you and Eun Chong.

70
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,840
It's the best move for you!

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,610
Stop pretending like
you care about me and Eun Chong.

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,750
You acted like you didn't care...

73
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,949
about money or compensation.
Do you still feel that way?

74
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,580
You should at least take some money
instead of Eun Chong.

75
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,389
Tell me how much you want.

76
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,889
You're telling me to take that
and get out of his life.

77
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,590
I don't take that kind of money.

78
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,329
You'll need money in the future.

79
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,600
You can think about it
and let me know.

80
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,470
Du Na must be watching everything
from the other side.

81
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,910
She'd be devastated.

82
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,910
Eun Chong wanted Kongkong.

83
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,649
Did you bring his luggage?

84
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,120
Why did you say
you wanted to live with Grandma?

85
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,389
I need to live with Grandma now...

86
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,399
to help Auntie Ha Na marry...

87
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:53,899
so that we can live together
in the future.

88
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,339
Grandma said she'd give...

89
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,139
a lot of money to her, too.

90
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,769
I see. That was the case.

91
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,939
But you must keep this a secret
from Auntie Ha Na.

92
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,410
Why?

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,649
She'd be heartbroken
if she found out.

94
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:13,720
Right?

95
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,689
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie.

96
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,389
Hey, there.

97
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,199
You knew that
you found your grandma, right?

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,069
Yes.

99
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,139
Can you stay, Auntie Ha Na?

100
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,149
If you say you want to live with me,
you can still come.

101
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,779
You said you'd live
with Grandma, Eun Chong.

102
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:48,589
You can tell Grandma...

103
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,790
you want to live with me
if you change your mind.

104
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,730
And don't cry too much
when you miss me.

105
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,470
What do I do when I want to see you?

106
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,040
Think of the phrase,
"No rain, no flowers."

107
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,870
That phrase will
keep us connected...

108
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,540
no matter where we are.

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,709
"No rain, no flowers?"

110
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,920
Stop making him cry, and leave now.

111
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,550
The chairwoman would be furious.

112
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,060
I'll go now.

113
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,660
Auntie Ha Na...

114
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,430
Say goodbye to her.

115
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,100
Please take good care of him.

116
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,639
He'll grow up well
as the son of Hyesung Group.

117
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,269
Don't worry about him.

118
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,019
Auntie Ha Na!

119
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,420
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Goodness.

120
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,949
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie Ha Na!

121
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,959
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie Ha Na!

122
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,990
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie Ha Na!

123
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,930
- You'll feel weak. Stop crying.
- Auntie Ha Na!

124
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,230
- Auntie Ha Na...
- Goodness, Eun Chong.

125
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,329
- Stop crying.
- Auntie...

126
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,569
Will you tell the chairwoman...

127
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,370
that my mom and I are behind this?

128
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,069
- Why wouldn't I?
- Don't.

129
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,079
She was going to get called out
as a fake daughter anyway.

130
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,949
You didn't think
it'd be a secret for life, did you?

131
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,889
I wanted to keep it quiet,
at least until Eun Chong turned 20.

132
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,189
And I wanted Ms. Goo to be
the chairwoman's real daughter.

133
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:37,629
You wanted her to be the heir
of Hyesung Group more than me.

134
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,329
- What's with you?
- The chairwoman wanted her.

135
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,329
And you know the reason.

136
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,639
Because of Eun Chong?

137
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,939
Did you steal the missing poster
at Goo Ji Seok's place?

138
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,310
You've been
visiting him at home, then.

139
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,480
No, I approached him for work.

140
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,079
I needed information on Richard Han.

141
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,949
You had no updates on Richard Han
after you went to the hotel.

142
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,980
Rather, some circumstances
led me to believe...

143
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,050
Director Goo got his hands
on our information.

144
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,959
Was it you who gave him tips
when he tried to sell the travel agency?

145
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,589
- No.
- The meeting with Hojin Rent-A-Car.

146
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,129
The file that Amira sent us.

147
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,759
I'm going to marry you.

148
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,399
Why would I hurt my own?

149
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,040
You could've been...

150
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,939
two-timing Goo Ji Seok and me.

151
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,509
You're back.

152
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,850
I heard everything, more or less.

153
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,750
How can this happen?

154
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,889
I thought you went to get Eun Chong.
Were you unable to bring him home?

155
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,960
He said he'd live
with his grandmother.

156
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,159
He said that?

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,100
Yes.

158
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,639
He would never say that.

159
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeo Jin, what did you say to him?

160
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,029
Mom, Dad.

161
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,629
I have no idea
how I'm going to live from now on.

162
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,470
All I ever did was
live a diligent life.

163
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,240
Everything is so unfair.

164
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,309
Do you still think...

165
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,850
"No rain, no flowers" is true?

166
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,080
I brought Kongkong, Eun Chong.

167
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,679
Eun Chong.

168
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,559
Do you want to come downstairs with me
and play with Lego blocks?

169
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,529
Then, do you want to play games?

170
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,399
Is there anything you want to do?

171
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,399
I want to go see Auntie Ha Na.

172
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,440
You said
you wanted to live with me...

173
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,669
for her happiness, right?

174
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,179
What will happen
to your auntie's happiness...

175
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,409
if you live with her?

176
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,419
You need to hang on just a bit,
no matter how much you miss her.

177
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,320
Then, I'll let you see her.

178
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,820
It'll be hard,
but let's stay strong. Okay?

179
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,559
Is it, "No rain, no flowers?"

180
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,929
What?

181
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,470
Oh, what's that in the flower pot?
"No rain, no flowers?"

182
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,730
That's our family motto.

183
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,899
If it doesn't rain,
flowers don't bloom, either.

184
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,440
It was something
my foster parents said.

185
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,879
I felt better
when I thought of that...

186
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,279
when tough things came my way.

187
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,919
That's right. No rain, no flowers.

188
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,659
He said he wanted to live
with his grandmother,

189
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,330
but I could see in his eyes
that he wanted to come with me.

190
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,769
But I had to leave him
and return alone.

191
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,100
I must've been out of my mind, too.

192
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,139
- You did a good job.
- "A good job?"

193
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,039
The chairwoman is just awful.

194
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,340
Ha Na is just like his mother.

195
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,649
How can she split up a mother
and her child in an instant?

196
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,149
And he's still too young.

197
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,919
We should all go over
and bring him home. Okay?

198
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,919
Yes, he's still a little child.

199
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,490
I'll keep him with me
until he graduates elementary...

200
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,159
It's better to let him go now
if you'll do that later.

201
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,360
He's Hyesung Group's grandson.

202
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,629
He needs to adapt to that world
as soon as he can.

203
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,370
Do you think so, too?

204
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,840
The chairwoman asked...

205
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,779
if there was anything
I could do for him from now on.

206
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
She said the only thing
I could do for him was...

207
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,620
cut my ties with him.

208
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,250
Is that really all I can do for him?

209
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,830
- Yes.
- Why are you adding to this?

210
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,259
I still didn't think
he should cut ties with us.

211
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,330
Cut your ties with him.

212
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,899
It's the best you can do
for each other.

213
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,409
Ha Na, Mr. Hwang is here.

214
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,009
Tell him to leave.

215
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,220
She wouldn't meet him yesterday, either.
Did they get into a fight?

216
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,899
How dare you come here?

217
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,669
Get out. Now.

218
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,070
I'm here to meet Ha Na, not you.

219
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,179
Get out.

220
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,740
I did Ha Na wrong,
but nothing to you.

221
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,679
You were the one who did me wrong.

222
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,879
You made my fiancée cheat on me.

223
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,789
You should've done a better job
at keeping her with you.

224
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,389
I gave you advice,
but you ignored it.

225
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,389
Get out.

226
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,960
You played around with Ha Na's life.
How dare you come here?

227
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,169
I have no reason
to hear this from you.

228
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:52,139
This is between Ha Na and me,
so you stay out of it.

229
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,179
Come outside.

230
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,120
Wait, what was that?

231
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:15,330
Hwang Jin Goo turned Ha Na
into her fake daughter?

232
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,629
And Yoon Se Young cheated on him
with Ji Seok... My gosh!

233
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,799
What now?

234
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,110
Don't ever appear
before Ha Na again.

235
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,850
If you do, I'll kill you.

236
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,960
Since when did you care so much
about your sister?

237
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,929
Wait, wasn't she your first love?

238
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,500
I guess
you aren't over your sister yet.

239
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,299
What about Se Young, then?

240
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,799
An ex-girlfriend?
A business partner?

241
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,909
An office wife?

242
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,179
And the man who can't keep his woman
continues to blabber.

243
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,110
Wait, did you try too hard
to hide your shame?

244
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,799
You called me hideous or whatever,

245
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,629
but you were the hideous one.

246
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,370
Yes, I am hideous,

247
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,039
and I owe 80 percent of that
to Chairwoman Shin.

248
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,610
And you probably share about 20 percent
of the responsibility.

249
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,879
You're her faithful dog.

250
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,580
Woof.

251
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,929
Don't ever appear
before Ha Na again.

252
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,840
No, learn your place
and stop interfering with us.

253
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:10,269
- "Us?"
- You're after Hyesung Group,

254
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,809
and you need
Yoon Se Young for your plan.

255
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,350
I was after Ha Na's happiness.

256
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,350
Everything has become nonsense now,

257
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,149
but I was sincere.

258
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,190
"Sincere?"

259
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,159
You destroyed the life of a woman
you liked and called that sincere?

260
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,860
You're the worst.

261
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,740
Get out of my sister's life
while I'm still nice.

262
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,740
No, and stop going on and on
about your first love...

263
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,870
because it's disgusting.

264
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,940
I'm better off than you,

265
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,080
a man who doesn't even know
who he likes.

266
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,059
You destroyed
the life of a woman you liked...

267
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,059
and called that sincere?
You're the worst.

268
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,569
A woman I liked?

269
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,109
Mr. Hwang was the key contributor
in turning you into a fake daughter?

270
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,279
That punk did that
and still dared to come here?

271
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,980
He was involved with Ha Na
only because of that scheme,

272
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,990
and Yoon Se Young
misunderstood Ha Na and that punk.

273
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,019
Darn it. This is so unfair.

274
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,930
Don't ever forgive that punk.

275
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:37,190
Leave. I'm going to sleep.

276
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,400
You haven't had dinner.

277
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,170
You need to eat something
before you sleep.

278
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,430
I have no appetite.

279
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
You didn't eat anything
yesterday, either.

280
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,200
You'll end up collapsing
if you keep doing this.

281
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,480
Who did you fight?

282
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,319
How did you end up
in a fistfight at this age?

283
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,589
Tell me.
I won't leave until you tell me.

284
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,990
Mom.

285
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,559
What's wrong? What is it?

286
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,799
I did...

287
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,940
something really wrong.

288
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,809
I did something
I shouldn't have done.

289
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,319
What did you do?

290
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,589
It's all right, so tell me.

291
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,960
I lied...

292
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:42,130
and told Ha Na
she was the chairwoman's daughter.

293
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,289
I deceived her and said...

294
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,759
she was the chairwoman's daughter.

295
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,069
What are you talking about?

296
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,470
You lied?

297
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,839
Eun Chong's aunt is
the chairwoman's daughter.

298
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,180
Are you saying she isn't?

299
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,589
I guess
you aren't over your sister yet.

300
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,690
What about Se Young, then?

301
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,630
An ex-girlfriend?
A business partner?

302
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,059
An office wife?

303
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,240
Mr. Han?

304
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
Why are you here?

305
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,970
What happened to your face?

306
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,279
Did you fight someone?

307
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,849
You're here, Mr. Han.

308
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,390
Do you two know each other?

309
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,049
How do you know him?

310
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,190
He's our tenant.

311
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,589
Yes.

312
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,869
Look what he did
to this handsome face.

313
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,000
Darn it. Hwang Jin Goo, that punk.

314
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,170
Do you at least feel lighter
after that fight?

315
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,410
No.

316
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,339
You should've called me.

317
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,380
I would've destroyed his face
like a crumpled piece of paper.

318
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,750
He wouldn't take
a single blow from you.

319
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,319
Did you move into our place
because of Ji Seok?

320
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,789
That and more.

321
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,460
Why did you keep it a secret?

322
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,359
I didn't want to concern Ji Seok
or make him feel awkward.

323
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,430
I wanted to be like a family
with his siblings in his place.

324
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,039
I wasn't too good, was I?

325
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,799
Goodness, no way.

326
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,670
You were
such a loving family member.

327
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,539
You bought us a bidet,

328
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:40,180
picked up Eun Chong,
repaired our home,

329
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,150
and even mentored me
before I began my business.

330
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,779
Thank you, sir.

331
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,450
But you didn't have
to hide it from me.

332
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,119
I wanted to surprise you.

333
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,589
Anyway, I was worried
about your sister.

334
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,960
Right? I hope she eats something.

335
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,940
You want to live with me, right?

336
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,440
Come with me.

337
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,150
I want to live here.

338
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,359
Why did he say that?

339
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,630
Let me see your neck.

340
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,970
Darn it.
How dare he lay a hand on my child?

341
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,539
Goo Ji Seok is a lunatic, too.

342
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,680
What took you so long
to figure that out?

343
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,049
Good grief.

344
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,180
What will you do
now that Jin Goo knows?

345
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,319
I'll kneel before him
and beg or something.

346
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,950
I can just insist his suspicion
about Ji Seok isn't true.

347
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,789
Wouldn't he tell my aunt that
I sent the poster to Goo Ha Na?

348
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,460
He'd have to expose everything
about you and Ji Seok,

349
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,559
including how you stole the poster
from Ji Seok's place.

350
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,039
No, he's not the type
who'll tell her right away.

351
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:14,140
Right?

352
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,039
We'll stall for time
and find a way to shut him up.

353
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,279
You have my trust, Mom.

354
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,019
Right. How did Goo Ha Na look
when Eun Chong said...

355
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,049
he'd live with his grandma?

356
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,089
She looked dazed,
like she took a huge blow.

357
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,319
I should've been here
to see that face.

358
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,690
It'll take a while
to erase Goo Ha Na's traces...

359
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,359
from Eun Chong.

360
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,500
You need to capture
Jin Goo's heart in that while.

361
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,299
Okay.

362
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:52,809
You have Kongkong now,
so give me your auntie's pajamas.

363
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,309
I don't want to.

364
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,609
I want to keep her pajamas.

365
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,650
I said you had to listen to me
if you wanted to meet your auntie.

366
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,859
I'll leave it in her room.

367
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,789
Come on.

368
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,200
Don't you want to see her?

369
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,289
Where did he go?

370
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,710
You can't sleep in this cold room.

371
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,579
Goodness, he feels so cold.

372
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,049
Eun Chong.

373
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,279
Eun Chong.

374
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,619
Eun Chong. Auntie is here.

375
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,559
Eun Chong.

376
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,200
Where is she going
this early in the morning?

377
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,950
She must be cold in those slippers.

378
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,230
Be careful. All right!

379
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,480
Eun Chong.

380
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,509
Auntie Ha Na, come quickly.

381
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,759
Are you okay?

382
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,400
Ha Na.

383
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,170
Ha Na.

384
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,490
I'm sorry.

385
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,190
I'm not asking you to forgive...

386
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,789
or understand me.

387
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,029
I've sinned greatly,

388
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,329
and I knew I couldn't be forgiven.

389
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,769
I won't ask for anything.

390
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,609
But I wanted to tell you this.

391
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,410
It'll sound like utter nonsense,
but one thing is for sure.

392
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,579
I only wanted you to be happy.

393
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,960
It's worse than utter nonsense.

394
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,559
I must've liked you, Ha Na.

395
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,630
I thought about this
again and again...

396
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,339
and wondered what I was thinking
when I deceived you.

397
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,369
Although you'd be a fake daughter,

398
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,480
I wanted to see you live happily...

399
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:54,609
like Cinderella.

400
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:58,920
She wasn't your real mom,
but I hoped you'd be happy...

401
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,950
under her shadow.

402
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,490
I was a fool.

403
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:09,890
I was an idiot.

404
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,259
I was a stupid dimwit.

405
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,900
There's no point
in saying all those now.

406
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:26,180
I never want to see you again.

407
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,970
He caught a cold.

408
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,839
He'll feel better
after an IV shot...

409
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,799
- and some sleep.
- Okay.

410
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,109
He'd need
a more accurate examination,

411
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,240
but just from our conversation,

412
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,609
he seemed to have
pediatric depression.

413
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:03,809
"Depression?"

414
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,549
Yes.

415
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,559
Ha Na, let's eat breakfast.

416
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,359
Get up, Ha Na.

417
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,930
Ha Na, do you feel sick?

418
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:24,470
You're feverish.

419
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,940
Get up. You need to see a doctor.

420
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:27,970
I'm fine.

421
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,839
You aren't fine.

422
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,589
I must've liked you,

423
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,490
Ha Na.

424
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,069
Are you going somewhere?

425
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:02,140
To the chairwoman's place.

426
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,670
Take good care of Eun Chong.

427
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,480
He must feel so alone
in that huge place.

428
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,650
I was also worried about his aunt.

429
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,920
She might be the chairwoman,
but this was too much.

430
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,119
Don't be so hard on yourself.

431
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,559
I should be hard on myself.

432
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,759
The chairwoman put you up for this.

433
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,630
I should've stopped her
until the end.

434
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,400
Her reckless ambition is
taking a toll on everyone.

435
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,970
Will you leave Eun Chong like that?

436
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,980
You said he had depression, too.

437
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,180
It's something he must put up with.

438
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,309
He needs to endure that
to be Hyesung's successor.

439
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,819
He's just a little boy...

440
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,549
before he's Hyesung's successor.

441
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,819
He was practically separated
from his mother figure by force.

442
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,890
He must feel nervous and uneasy.

443
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,230
This is just cruel
to both Ha Na and Eun Chong.

444
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,059
Yes, so I also thought
long and hard about it.

445
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,829
Do you have
something to say, Yeo Jin?

446
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,799
- Yes, have a seat.
- Okay.

447
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:12,279
My priority is
for Eun Chong to find his peace.

448
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,609
Of course.

449
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,250
That was why I thought of a way.

450
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:20,220
Why don't you two marry...

451
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,019
and adopt Eun Chong?

452
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,430
You want us to adopt him?

453
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,359
That'd be wonderful.

454
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,299
There are no parents...

455
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,529
who'll be better
at taking care of Eun Chong.

456
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:40,799
- Isn't that so, Se Young?
- Yes.

457
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,910
It also sounds great to me,
Aunt Yeo Jin.

458
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:46,740
You two will also become
the heirs to Hyesung Group...

459
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,750
after you adopt Eun Chong.

460
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,450
Our priority is to raise Eun Chong
into a wonderful successor.

461
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,950
Jin Goo and Se Young's marriage...

462
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,660
and Eun Chong's adoption.

463
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,220
Everything
worked itself out wonderfully.

464
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,359
Isn't that so, Jin Goo?

465
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,660
Se Young seems happy with this.
What do you think?

466
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,869
I don't want to do this.

467
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,269
Why not?

468
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,910
I...

469
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,009
cannot marry Se Young.

470
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,039
Jin Goo.

471
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:22,950
I'd like to call off the engagement.

472
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,880
(Cinderella Game)

473
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,480
Ji Seok was Se Young's other man?

474
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:30,180
That's more than enough
to break off our engagement.

475
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,309
I don't love you.

476
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,680
Isn't it because of Goo Ha Na?

477
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,819
You called the engagement off?

478
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:36,519
Mother, I feel miserable.

479
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:38,519
How's Ha Na?

480
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,789
Eun Chong has a reduced appetite
and insomnia.

481
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:42,019
He's suffering from depression.

482
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,329
Can I go to Auntie Ha Na's place?

483
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:45,359
Eun Chong.

484
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,559
This was a chance
sent to us by fate.

485
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,869
I'll kill myself
if you call the engaement off.

486
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,470
I'll kill myself!
