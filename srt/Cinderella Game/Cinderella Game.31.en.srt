1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,810
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,209
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,950
(Episode 31)

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,789
I can't put a finger on it,

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,859
but I can see you
on Eun Chong's face.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,059
It's a wonder.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,660
Really?

9
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,559
I became even more curious...

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,730
about my birth mother
after I gave birth to Eun Chong.

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,570
That's why I will find her.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,399
It'll be great
for Eun Chong to have a grandmother.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,240
Don't you want to find
your birth mother?

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,880
My foster parents are
like my real parents.

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,380
I've never heard about
or seen my birth mother, so not really.

16
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,350
But still,
you should register your DNA.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,119
Even you couldn't find your parents.
How could I find anyone?

18
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,460
You must've gone missing,
but my mom left me.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,899
If she wanted to find me,
she would've done so already.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,759
But still.
She might be looking for you.

21
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,469
It'd be nice if you found someone
you could lean on.

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,340
I have my parents here in my heart.

23
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:15,579
Someone is looking for you.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,519
Someone who may be
your biological mother.

25
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,930
I didn't think I'd think
of my birth mother at this age.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,700
Could she really be...

27
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,530
my biological mother?

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,219
Du Na, you know...

29
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:56,019
if she's my birth mother
or not, right?

30
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,230
If she is my birth mother,

31
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,060
then why is she looking for me now?

32
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,000
Would my life change in any way...

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,500
if I met my real mom now?

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,020
Ms. Goo,
what do you have inside you?

35
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,659
What gave you the strength
to hold out to this day...

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,560
without anyone to rely on?

37
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,639
He's your friend's son?

38
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,639
She was like family.

39
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,710
Eun Chong had no one in his life,

40
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,669
so naturally, I decided to take him.

41
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,479
My family is what charges my energy.

42
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,879
When I'm with my siblings
and Eun Chong,

43
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,110
I feel full at heart,
even though we're broke...

44
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,250
and don't own a home.

45
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,479
When I was younger,

46
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:03,659
I always felt empty here,

47
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,719
like the wind blew
through a hole here.

48
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:07,889
If anyone finds out...

49
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,430
she isn't
the chairwoman's real daughter,

50
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,560
everyone will be miserable.

51
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,500
It doesn't leave out anyone.
Every single one.

52
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,939
I can't let anyone find out.

53
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,419
Ms. Goo.

54
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,990
Please be happy.

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,729
I'll do my best...

56
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,229
to let it happen.

57
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,229
You...

58
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,740
surely deserve...

59
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,610
to be happy.

60
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,050
Hurry up, Uncle Ji Chang.
I'm about to wet my pants!

61
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,219
Eun Chong, do you have to go now?
Do you want a bottle?

62
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,319
I don't want that.

63
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,990
Then, let's give manure
to the vegetable garden.

64
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,460
No.

65
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,560
Ji Chang, hurry up and come out.

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,300
You only need five minutes
in the morning.

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,470
Goodness.

68
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,800
My gosh.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,699
Ji Chang! Come out now.
Eun Chong needs to go now.

70
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,879
I was in my morning meditation
while thinking of my great work.

71
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,639
Why is that young boy
making such a scene?

72
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,449
Gosh, it smells!

73
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,750
This was why people should live
in a house with two bathrooms.

74
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,490
That way, we can uphold our dignity.

75
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,319
- Isn't that so, sir?
- You're full of energy this early.

76
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,889
Things are always a mess here.

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,759
- Did you go to the mineral spring?
- I did.

78
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,860
How was your first night here?

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,060
I had a good night's sleep.

80
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,529
Auntie Ha Na, my butt is cold.

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,500
Gosh, the bathroom must be cold.

82
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,410
I should pull out
the toilet seat cover.

83
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,779
Good morning, Grandpa.

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,009
Did you sleep well, Eun Chong?

85
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,959
You must
deceive everyone smoothly...

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,089
so that
even Ms. Choi does not notice.

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,000
I have to either remove it
or make a new one?

88
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
What's going on, Yeo Jin?

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,269
What's wrong with the fireplace?

90
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,569
He came to check on the fireplace,
and there must be a lot of problems.

91
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,339
Its structural integrity is failing
because it's quite old.

92
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,769
The inside was badly cracked.

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,910
It could heat up nearby walls
or even the ceiling,

94
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,410
so we'd ask most of our clients
to remove it altogether.

95
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,750
Goodness,
we can't let it cause any danger.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,589
You should remove it first,
then make a new one.

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,990
It wouldn't mean anything
for me to have a new one.

98
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,029
You're right. It was only meaningful
because Yu Jin used it as a child.

99
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,829
Also, the wooden swing in the garden
looked dangerous.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,730
What about the swing?

101
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,370
How is it?

102
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,709
It's seriously unlevel.

103
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,779
It looks like there's a problem
with the bolts or the wooden posts.

104
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,540
It could cause an accident
if you do not pull it down.

105
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,810
"Pull it down?"

106
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,649
No, Yu Jin.

107
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,889
- Goodness, Ms. Chairwoman.
- My goodness.

108
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,149
Are you okay, Yeo Jin?

109
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,220
What do we do now? Goodness.

110
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,930
Oh, no.

111
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,199
How could she suddenly pull down
both the fireplace and the swing...

112
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,540
all at the same time?

113
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,139
It must break her heart.

114
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,980
What's this?

115
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,379
Something is in here.

116
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,449
("Three Friends"
Lee Ha Na. Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na)

117
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,949
Can I throw this out?

118
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,990
What's that?

119
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,720
I saw this dropped
in front of the safe last time,

120
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,490
so I had put it up there,
but I saw it again under the bed.

121
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,959
I was wondering
if this was important.

122
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,230
What's that, Yeo Jin?

123
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,199
What? It's nothing.

124
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,240
- If you're done, you may go.
- Yes, of course.

125
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,449
What was it?

126
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,779
A piece of paper.

127
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,649
You said you wondered
if it was something important.

128
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
What was on it?

129
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,790
Something about three.

130
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,319
"Three?"

131
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,990
Numbers?

132
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,399
She said it wasn't a big deal.
Why are you prying?

133
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,629
Why did she put it in her pocket
if it wasn't important?

134
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,209
How can you betray me like this?

135
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,480
How can you tell them the truth
and say she hit her?

136
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,310
Aren't you all on my team?

137
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,750
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

138
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,420
You're sorry now?

139
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,750
You make me shudder
with this sense of betrayal.

140
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,189
The police said we could be punished
if we bore false witness.

141
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,490
Then, you should've told
the whole story.

142
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,029
You only tried to save yourselves,

143
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,290
regardless of what happened
to my mom.

144
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,899
You did betray me!

145
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,329
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

146
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,529
Forget it.

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
I won't have to see
all of you anymore.

148
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,769
- What?
- Why?

149
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:19,899
Are you scared of getting fired?

150
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,939
Well...

151
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,810
- What now? Are we getting fired?
- What do we do?

152
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,410
If we get fired, let's report her
to the Labor Administration.

153
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,559
I don't know who my real mom is,
so how do you know her?

154
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,899
Everything is
just a speculation for now.

155
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,230
Why do you speculate
that she's my birth mother?

156
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,740
You should hear it from her.

157
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,509
Do you have memories before seven,
before the children's home?

158
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,440
I don't have any memories
before when I was seven.

159
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,179
- Hello, Mr. Hwang.
- Hello.

160
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,399
Yes?

161
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,500
Ms. Goo.

162
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,210
Mr. Hwang,
may I have a word with you?

163
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,110
Sure. Have a seat.

164
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,649
Did you sleep well last night?

165
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,720
Thanks to you, I didn't.

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,090
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,929
Have you told her...

168
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,360
that I wanted to meet her?

169
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,700
- Yes.
- What did she say?

170
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,440
- It wasn't time...
- I wanted to meet her,

171
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
but she said no?

172
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,139
Would she give up
if I turned this down?

173
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,409
She wouldn't.

174
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,210
- She'll give you more time to...
- What do you think, Mr. Hwang?

175
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,679
Do I seem like her daughter?
Do I look like her?

176
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,620
How likely do you think
I'll be her daughter?

177
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,850
Over 50 percent?

178
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,460
- Ms. Goo.
- How did you find me?

179
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,330
And how do you know her?

180
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,629
It was a coincidence.

181
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,899
"A coincidence?"

182
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:34,210
She had registered her DNA
at the police station a long time ago.

183
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:37,240
You could've met her long ago...

184
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,379
if you also had done that.

185
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,210
She did her part and tried.

186
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,950
Why wouldn't she meet me if she was
so desperate to find her daughter?

187
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,019
I keep asking you the same question.

188
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,090
She must've been...

189
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,490
keeping her eyes on me.

190
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,830
Who is she?

191
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,169
Is she someone I know?

192
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,009
Yu Jin.

193
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,210
I must keep our memories
only with these photos.

194
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,250
But you understand, right?

195
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,019
What if she is someone you know?

196
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,190
Who is she?

197
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,889
It might be better for each other
if you took the DNA test first.

198
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,389
If you aren't her daughter,
you two won't have to meet.

199
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,190
- It'll be easier...
- "Easier?"

200
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,769
It doesn't feel easy
to do a parentage test...

201
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,269
with this person I don't even know.

202
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
It feels weird and offensive.

203
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,570
It's so cheap.

204
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:45,110
I understand how you feel.

205
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,779
I truly wish to help you, Ms. Goo.

206
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,090
You don't have to.

207
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,460
Please tell her that
I won't do the parentage test.

208
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,720
Excuse me.

209
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,200
You're abandoning the possibility
of meeting your birth mother.

210
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't care about that
at this point in time.

211
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,500
Please excuse me.

212
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,169
You said your wish was...

213
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,940
for your foster parents
to come back alive.

214
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,110
What if your birth mother showed up
in their place?

215
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,250
What would
your foster parents say...

216
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,080
if they saw you right now?

217
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,049
Would they want you to give up...

218
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,519
the chance
to meet your birth mother?

219
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,190
My foster parents...

220
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,159
would've told her to meet me first.

221
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,669
How can my mom be like that?

222
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,009
She should want to meet me right now
if she were my mom.

223
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,509
She wouldn't do that
if she were my real mom.

224
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,320
She's not my mom. She's not.

225
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,820
I don't have to do the test
or meet her.

226
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,799
Have you been crying?

227
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,200
- No.
- You cried.

228
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,470
Why did you cry
after walking out of Mr. Hwang's office?

229
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:25,779
What did you two talk about
that made you cry in the restroom?

230
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,179
- Tell me.
- It's far from your imagination.

231
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:34,289
Director Goo reported my mom
and banned her from the building...

232
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,049
after she beat you
because of my misunderstanding.

233
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,019
Then, you need to explain
this situation.

234
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,419
What's going on?

235
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,990
Are you two really dating
behind my back?

236
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,230
I said no!

237
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,000
Why won't you trust him?

238
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,129
Why would he date me
while he was already with you?

239
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,830
He's not insane!

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,370
Did you just shout at me?

241
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,039
Have you lost your mind?

242
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,840
He needs to show me trust
to make me trust him.

243
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,580
- Tell me why you cried!
- I'm an orphan,

244
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,110
although you may not have known.

245
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,789
Someone who might be my birth mother
suddenly showed up.

246
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,220
Happy now?

247
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,000
"Birth mother?"

248
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,610
Did Goo Ha Na find her birth mother?

249
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,110
Who told you that?

250
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,639
She did.

251
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,549
She was crying in the restroom.

252
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,049
- "Crying?"
- Anyway.

253
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,850
Why is she discussing
her birth mother with you?

254
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,419
It's only a possibility for now.

255
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,419
Pretend like you don't know.

256
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,559
But why is she
discussing this with you?

257
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:50,190
A while ago, this lady was...

258
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,000
peeking at Ms. Goo in the lobby.

259
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,830
I asked who she was,

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,830
and she said
Ms. Goo could be her daughter.

261
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,009
Then, she asked if I could tell her
to receive a parentage test.

262
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,509
She could've asked herself.
Why did she ask you?

263
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,679
I'm sure she has a story.

264
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:09,509
I was just delivering her words.

265
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,519
- So? Did she say yes?
- Not yet.

266
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,389
She could be her birth mother.
Why not?

267
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,590
She must need more time.

268
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,429
Her birth mother
must be an awful woman.

269
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,330
If she were rich,
she'd want to do the test now.

270
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,759
Get to work.

271
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,809
She cried?

272
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,820
I didn't hear anything.
Just forget it.

273
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,320
I don't have a birth mother.

274
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,620
She'll do the test
after meeting me first?

275
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,929
Yes, she asked
if you were someone she knew.

276
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,629
I couldn't say no.

277
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,330
She'd find out soon anyway.

278
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,529
She couldn't imagine it'd be me.

279
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,269
That's the case for now,
but she may notice...

280
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,870
if we drag this out further.

281
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:09,470
We have many problems to resolve
in the fake daughter project.

282
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,279
Everything may go haywire
if I meet her now...

283
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,940
and make a mistake.

284
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,250
Let's resolve the problems first.

285
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,549
Why don't we do this?

286
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,549
Ms. Goo was born as your daughter...

287
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:25,120
and went missing
by the sea at the age of seven.

288
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,789
She lived with the man
who saved her at that time,

289
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,059
but his house caught on fire,
and the man died.

290
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,000
Ms. Goo was then left alone
and sent to the children's home.

291
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,700
Her memories weren't intact
because she went through...

292
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,370
two series of accidents.

293
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,870
To this day, she believed
that man was her father.

294
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,940
I'll just have to change the age
of Yu Jin's disappearance to seven.

295
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:48,250
We can do this
if we do not mention her age.

296
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,549
Yes.

297
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,620
It'd work on others,

298
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,080
but I was worried
about Se Young and Mother.

299
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,250
- If they're under the same roof...
- I'll manage that part.

300
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,559
We'll have to see
if there are other discrepancies,

301
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,190
so I need to take time
until I meet Ms. Goo.

302
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,730
You should meet Ms. Goo first.

303
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,869
We would've figured out
and resolved any other problems...

304
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,730
between now and the time it takes
to have the result of the test.

305
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,339
Ms. Goo is someone
who will become your daughter.

306
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,380
She already has
a lot of hurt in her life.

307
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,710
You shouldn't hurt her, either.

308
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,849
Please consider Eun Chong.

309
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,849
You need to have him home
as soon as possible.

310
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,690
Is Ms. Yoon
really transferring to the hotel?

311
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,599
I heard it from Mr. Hwang.

312
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,099
Then, we won't be fired?

313
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,430
Isn't this good for you, too, Ha Na?

314
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,740
Anyway, how could she
get transferred to the hotel?

315
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,210
She was involved in an assault,

316
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,279
yet she got promoted?

317
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,710
She's a part of their family.

318
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,210
We have no connections,
so we need to hold our horses.

319
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,750
Hey.

320
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,950
Ms. Yoon will transfer to the hotel
starting next week.

321
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,690
She'll wrap up everything
at the travel agency this week.

322
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,490
Thank you for your hard work,
Ms. Yoon.

323
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,930
Sure, Mr. Hwang.

324
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,700
Congratulations, Ms. Yoon.

325
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,700
Congratulations, Ms. Yoon.

326
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,569
This is such a shame.

327
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,069
How can you leave so suddenly?

328
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,440
She's right. This is such a shame.

329
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,869
Don't be so sad.

330
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,279
I'll continue to use this office.

331
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,339
Sorry?

332
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,880
That's great.

333
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,750
What?

334
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:35,890
Mr. Hwang, this is
an official document from Dubai.

335
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,920
Give it to me.

336
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,990
Hello? This is Hwang Jin Goo
of Hyesung Tour calling. Yes.

337
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,430
I need to confirm the authenticity
of an official document from Dubai.

338
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,470
Yes, I'll visit you soon. Okay.

339
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,140
Did you ask the legal team
to check the document?

340
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,210
Yes, I'm meeting them right now.

341
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,609
If the document was forged,

342
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,609
could it be used as evidence
for Director Goo's intervention?

343
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:01,980
I have to do it.

344
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,480
Hyesung Tour depends on it.

345
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,579
Why did Director Goo
want to see you yesterday?

346
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,420
He told me to take
the files for marketing.

347
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,420
I asked for the investors' files,
but he said I'd only do as he said.

348
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,490
Is he drawing a line already?

349
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,099
Can you find out more
about Richard Han?

350
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,869
(Hyesung Tour)

351
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,599
These are the dates
when the chairwoman can do a video call.

352
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,339
Do you know
where Mr. Han's new place is?

353
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:34,849
He wouldn't tell me.

354
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,019
I wanted to meet him there,
but he wouldn't tell me, either.

355
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,420
Yes, Mr. Han. It's me.

356
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,289
I have the dates
when Chairwoman Shin can do a video call.

357
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,990
I'll send you a text message.
Please give me a date to set it up.

358
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,400
All right.
I'll call you after checking.

359
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,930
Will you not invite me
to your place?

360
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,440
I thought we should be careful
until everything was over.

361
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,180
- Is that disappointing?
- No, I'll wait.

362
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,140
Make sure you eat well, sir.

363
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,579
Yes, goodbye.

364
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,519
- That's probably Ms. Yoon.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,960
Have a seat.

366
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,660
I read through the files
regarding the hotel.

367
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,200
Get the files on the New York branch
from Mr. Jung.

368
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,099
We'll begin
the marketing meeting very soon.

369
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,170
All right.

370
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,710
Right. I heard the chairwoman
and Richard Han are doing a video call.

371
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,579
You said he was like a stepfather.

372
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,450
I wonder what he's like.

373
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,180
Why do you want to know
what the investor is like?

374
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,220
You're here for marketing...

375
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,819
What if my interest is personal?

376
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,920
You made the offer first,
so I decided to consider...

377
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,859
whom I should side with
to take Hyesung Group over.

378
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,930
To do that, I need to know
what Richard Han is like...

379
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,369
because he's your connection.

380
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:04,700
Are you ready to believe
the information I give you on him?

381
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,210
Did Mr. Hwang make you do this?

382
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,240
He sent his woman as a spy.

383
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Do you feel inferior to Ji Seok?

384
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,079
Or are you just jealous?

385
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,289
I want to know what Richard Han is like
because of your offer.

386
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,049
Why?

387
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,789
Were you scared
I'd accept your meaningless offer?

388
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,039
"A spy?"

389
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,170
He's provoking me quite bluntly.

390
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,940
He's suspicious of me anyway,
so I'll be a real good spy.

391
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,809
I'll give him what he wants
and take what I need,

392
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,680
although I'm not sure what he wants.

393
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,410
We don't know if the information
he provides will be trustworthy.

394
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:55,119
Have you heard anything
about Goo Ji Seok in America?

395
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,890
I didn't know the guy.

396
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,390
- Why?
- Should I look into it?

397
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,730
He seemed to hold
a personal animosity against me.

398
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,230
What do you mean?

399
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,099
It's something I can feel as a man.

400
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,339
Something like this involves
either money or women.

401
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,440
Is he into you?

402
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,009
- Are you crazy?
- Right?

403
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,839
Why is he like this to me?

404
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:23,279
I'll ask my friends in America
and find whatever I can on him.

405
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,960
She had registered her DNA...

406
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,190
and spent a long time
looking for me?

407
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,660
If she was someone I knew,
could it be someone around me?

408
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,069
I said I'd ignore what he said.
Why do I keep thinking about it?

409
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,680
Yali's temperature
came down to normal,

410
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,609
and the inflammation
slowly got better, too.

411
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,890
Let's do the video call
tomorrow morning at 11 a.m.

412
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,220
Keep it under 15 minutes,
strictly regarding the investment.

413
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,589
Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.

414
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,089
Right now?

415
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,599
Well, I have to pick up my nephew.

416
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,660
Can we do it tomorrow?

417
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,329
Should I pick Eun Chong up?

418
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,740
Will you do that?

419
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,269
(Chamsae Kindergarten)

420
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:24,039
- Did you have a great day?
- Yes, it was fun.

421
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,410
Why isn't Eun Chong out yet?

422
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,680
He's there all day.

423
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,220
- "All day?"
- Yes.

424
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,890
Ms. Goo's younger brother
sometimes comes around this hour,

425
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,420
but Ms. Goo mostly picks him up...

426
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,289
around 7 p.m. after she gets off work.

427
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,859
That young boy...

428
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,200
spends all day at the kindergarten
from the morning until 7 p.m.?

429
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,809
- That's odd.
- What's wrong?

430
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,710
It's that car.
I keep seeing it around here.

431
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,980
Yeo Jin?

432
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,880
That's a no-parking zone,
so why don't you report it?

433
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,559
It'd be nice
if you could pick me up...

434
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,890
when Auntie Ha Na
and Uncle Ji Chang couldn't.

435
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,829
I'll pick you up
when I have nothing to do.

436
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,329
Gosh, really?

437
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:23,970
- Are you that happy?
- Yes!

438
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,210
It's boring to be there alone
after other kids all leave.

439
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:34,279
My teacher also can't leave early
because of me.

440
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,460
If she keeps coming over
to see Eun Chong,

441
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,460
I'll end up getting caught, too.

442
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,029
Eun Chong,
I'll pick you up more often,

443
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,829
so can you promise me something?

444
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,470
What is it?

445
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,940
It's our family's secret...

446
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,910
- that I live here with you.
- Why?

447
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm Santa, remember?

448
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,609
What if your friends wait
right out front to get presents?

449
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,750
So, this is a secret.

450
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,299
Why did someone report me
right then?

451
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,210
I didn't get to see Eun Chong leave
because of that.

452
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,740
I probably can't see him in front
of the kindergarten anymore, right?

453
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,109
No, someone may report us
for parking illegally.

454
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,150
Then, someone will
contact you at work.

455
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:47,650
You should see him
on his way to the kindergarten.

456
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,519
Also, you should remove
your family photos, shouldn't you?

457
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,000
Find a way.

458
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:06,900
Yes, ma'am.

459
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,339
You're home, Yeo Jin.

460
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,210
I heard you'd be making a video call
with Richard Han tomorrow.

461
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,319
How can he postpone the investment?

462
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,849
You should nitpick over this
with him tomorrow.

463
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,150
I plan to do that.

464
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,220
Where are you doing it?

465
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,990
At home? Or at work?

466
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,890
She'll do it at home at 11 a.m.

467
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,529
Then, I'll also get to see
what Richard Han looks like.

468
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,970
I really wonder
what he looks like...

469
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,569
Why did you keep that children's sticker
on the mirror?

470
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,769
I thought it was cute.

471
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,140
People will see that
and think you have a grandson.

472
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,349
Your dinner is ready.
Please come on out.

473
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,650
Why don't you take it off?

474
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,589
Just leave it there.

475
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,319
I think you and Jin Goo are right.

476
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,630
I need to meet Ms. Goo soon...

477
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,529
to bring Eun Chong home
as soon as possible.

478
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,900
Hey there, Yali.

479
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,539
Hang in there a little more.

480
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,539
You can go home when you are well.

481
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,319
She was crying in the restroom.

482
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,259
Did I hurt her already
even before I began?

483
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,529
How's Yali?

484
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,130
Mr. Hwang.

485
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
She looks much better.

486
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,740
You're right. She already has
a different facial expression.

487
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,779
Yali was blessed to meet
such trustworthy guardians.

488
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:00,950
Will you let her go
once she gets better?

489
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,890
I'll keep her temporarily
until she gets adopted.

490
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,940
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

491
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,079
Ms. Goo!

492
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,109
One moment.

493
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,279
- That woman...
- That's enough, Mr. Hwang.

494
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,119
You've crossed the line
a long time ago.

495
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,420
I was a bit shaken and nervous for a bit
after hearing about my mom,

496
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,059
and I even got hopeful.

497
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,730
But I find everything annoying now.

498
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,759
You can meet her.

499
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,400
You can meet that woman.

500
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,329
She'll meet me?

501
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,140
Yes, when do you want to do it?

502
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,210
She'll meet you when you want to.

503
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:00,410
Tomorrow.

504
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:17,230
Why did you need that dress this early?
Who are you seeing?

505
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:18,930
A man?

506
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,599
I have no time to see a man.

507
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,500
Auntie, you look so pretty.

508
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,970
You're the prettiest.

509
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,740
- Thank you.
- Good luck!

510
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,240
You don't know what I'm about to do.

511
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,549
The video call got postponed?

512
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:36,849
Suddenly? Why?

513
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,980
Something urgent came up
for Chairwoman Shin.

514
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,619
But I don't know the reason.

515
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,289
Is she ill?

516
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:46,319
Danny will find out
where she's going.

517
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,029
Gosh, I should've taken
a calming pill.

518
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,369
She's almost here.

519
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,410
All right.

520
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:23,329
She said she was going to the temple
after the video call got postponed.

521
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,759
This isn't the temple, Yeo Jin.

522
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,400
Who is she seeing?

523
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,130
Maybe it's about Yu Jin.

524
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,039
If it was, I would've caught on.

525
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,900
We can go in and see it.

526
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,339
She'd notice that we followed her.

527
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,910
We won't get caught. Follow me.

528
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,150
She's here.

529
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,599
Ms. Chairwoman.

530
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,210
Ms. Goo.

531
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,640
Thank you for coming.

532
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,819
Yes, the chairwoman was that woman.

533
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,049
The woman
who may be your birth mother.

534
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,539
(Cinderella Game)

535
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,710
Yoon Se Young and her mother
tailed her?

536
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,109
It must be about her daughter.

537
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,140
I will do the test.

538
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,940
Do not let anyone else find out.

539
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,950
Please show me
the CCTV footage, too.

540
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,150
So, what if I am
the chairwoman's daughter?

541
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,720
This is a huge deal.

542
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,319
I'd be like Cinderella overnight.

543
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,750
We don't know anything yet.

544
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,720
She could expose Eun Chong, too.

545
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,519
Why did she meet her
in such a hurry?

546
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,960
I thought this was the best choice.

547
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,529
I won't let anyone notice.
