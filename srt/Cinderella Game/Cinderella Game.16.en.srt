00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,009
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,650
(Episode 16)

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,719
Du Na! Lee Du Na!

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,660
Ha Na!

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,460
- Ha Na!
- Hey!

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,329
- My gosh!
- Hey! Come here.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,329
- Du Na!
- Hey!

10
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,250
This ramyeon is out of this world.

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,350
It didn't taste like this
in America.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,719
It doesn't taste like this
even when I cook it at home.

13
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,049
I wanted to have it with you
when you came to Seoul,

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,560
so I held myself back
from having it.

15
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:51,759
Thank you.

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,630
Ha Na,
I think I found my mom's place.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,670
You did? You really found her?

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,269
- Where was it?
- I'm not 100 percent sure yet,

19
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,739
but something feels very familiar.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,310
I think I'll know as soon
as I walk into the front yard.

21
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,379
Then, you should
meet the current owner.

22
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,540
So, I asked the lady there...

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,980
if the place had a tree swing
and a fireplace,

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,480
but she was in a rush
to go somewhere.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,079
She moved in last year, but she said
the previous owners left an address.

26
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,590
We're meeting today.

27
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,159
Really? Where are you meeting her?
Let's go there together.

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,159
Hey, you have to go to work.

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,659
Let's go together
after I make sure it's the place.

30
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,099
I don't want you
to make the trip in vain.

31
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,230
All right. Tell her that
you want to see the inside, too.

32
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,739
And check for the fireplace.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,269
Where are you meeting her?

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,439
She'll text me
the place and the time.

35
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,069
You aren't meeting her at home?

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,739
I would've gone with you
if it hadn't been for my night shift.

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,819
I have a feeling
you're right about this.

38
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,150
I do, too.

39
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,420
Hey, your lunch is over.

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,590
What? Gosh, why does time fly?

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,760
Jeez.

42
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,599
Good luck, Du Na.

43
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,300
- Call me after.
- Okay.

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,370
Okay?

45
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,270
Hey, be careful!

46
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,340
Right! Bring Eun Chong next time.
I want to meet him.

47
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,639
Bye now.

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,210
Bye! Call me!

49
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,310
Bye!

50
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,650
(Chapel of Rest)

51
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,419
Are you Ms. Lee's friend?

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
Yes.

53
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,759
- Is Du Na...
- Please come inside.

54
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,430
(Chapel of Rest)

55
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,860
Du Na...

56
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,560
No.

57
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,560
Du Na.

58
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,699
Wake up, Du Na.

59
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,270
Du Na.

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,069
Wake up, Du Na!

61
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,770
Du Na!

62
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,479
Du Na! Why are you here?

63
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,250
Du Na!

64
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,590
She got into a hit-and-run accident
on a national highway in Siwang-ri.

65
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:37,860
"A hit-and-run accident?"

66
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,389
Yes, we were looking for the car
by analyzing nearby CCTVs,

67
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,500
but it happened in a blind spot,
so it didn't look easy.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Did your friend tell you
that she was going to Siwang-ri?

69
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,030
No.

70
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,099
She has no reason to go there.

71
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,979
She said she was
meeting someone yesterday,

72
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,610
and that person was
going to text her when and where.

73
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,349
Have you met that person?

74
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,080
At this point in time,
we have no way of knowing...

75
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,520
who she was with.

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,650
Why not?

77
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,659
You can check her cell phone.

78
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,889
We retrieved her belongings
at the scene,

79
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,590
but her phone wasn't there.

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,100
"Her phone wasn't there?"

81
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,569
It must've been destroyed
or gone missing during the accident.

82
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,839
She said it was a lady.

83
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,069
She said she was meeting this lady.

84
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:28,810
That isn't enough of a lead
to start a search.

85
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,610
We were trying to find
the cars that drove by.

86
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,810
I'll reach out to you
as soon as I find something.

87
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,220
A hit-and-run accident?

88
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,990
Ha Na.

89
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,730
Reverend Mother.

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,500
My goodness.

91
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,209
Eun Chong.

92
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,910
You poor thing.

93
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,060
Eun Chong has grown this big now.

94
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,160
I wouldn't have
let you go like that...

95
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,100
if I had known it'd be
the last time I saw you.

96
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,769
Who was the lady you met?

97
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:36,040
You got into that accident
when you went to see her, right?

98
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,209
I should've asked you...

99
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,149
for the neighborhood
of that house you mentioned.

100
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,360
What do I do?

101
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,129
If their DNA match,
it must be 100 percent certain.

102
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,699
Don't worry. Yu Jin won't show up.

103
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,870
She even did the parentage test.

104
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,370
She may not remember anything now,

105
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,639
but what if
everything comes back later?

106
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,170
Look at me.

107
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,610
Do you trust me or not?

108
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,379
- Do you or don't you?
- I do.

109
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,879
Then, trust me and stay calm.

110
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,250
Make sure you keep a straight face
around Yeo Jin.

111
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,649
Tell her you'll look after Yu Jin...

112
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,790
and take good care of her
when she comes.

113
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
Then, nothing will happen.

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,129
What are you talking about, Mom?

115
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,459
Yu Jin will never show up.

116
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,100
How can you be so sure?

117
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,740
Because all those shamans said
Yu Jin was already dead?

118
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,670
How can you just believe them
and sit on your hands?

119
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,339
No, I can't believe it. I'm scared.

120
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,879
It feels like
she'll show up at any moment...

121
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,819
Listen up.

122
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,259
Are you serious?

123
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,459
You just have to trust me.

124
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,139
I don't know.

125
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,649
I really don't know.

126
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,680
I don't know anything.

127
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,680
Where's Yu Jin?

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,620
She was with you.

129
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,389
Why did you let Yu Jin
get on that boat all alone?

130
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,089
What were you doing?

131
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,389
No.

132
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,589
It's your fault.

133
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,990
You always hated me.

134
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,560
You wanted me to disappear.

135
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,069
- It's all because of your lies.
- No!

136
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,860
Goodness.

137
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,049
(Yoon Yu Jin)

138
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:41,320
Yu Jin, just rest in peace
on the other side.

139
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,759
Only your mom will suffer...

140
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,690
if you keep giving her such hope.

141
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:54,230
Should I just tell her
that you already died?

142
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,570
Wake up, Uncle Ji Chang!

143
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,639
Wake up, Uncle Ji Chang!

144
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,009
Hey.

145
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,019
Open your eyes, Uncle Ji Chang!

146
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,750
Get out of here.
My head is spinning.

147
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,259
That boy is pure evil.

148
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,330
Auntie Ji Eun!

149
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,299
Right, she's not here anymore.

150
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,639
Why did I have a dream
about Du Na's accident?

151
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,480
Was it because I thought of her
before going to sleep?

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,549
I woke Uncle Ji Chang up.

153
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,149
Auntie Ji Eun is probably up, right?

154
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,759
Yes, I'm sure.

155
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,559
I hate mornings the most
in this world.

156
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,759
No, I hate you the most,
you evil punk.

157
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,799
Hey. Then, I'll stop you
from seeing another day.

158
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,000
Gosh, you're so extreme.

159
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,570
Are you okay, Ha Na?

160
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,269
Aren't I older than you?

161
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,169
Why do I have to make you
hangover soup?

162
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,879
I was so mad that
I couldn't stop drinking.

163
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,850
Framing you as a thief?

164
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,750
Start serving rice.

165
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,990
I'm meeting Ji Seok today.

166
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,190
I'll meet him
and have a talk about...

167
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,220
Don't.

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,730
If I need anything, I'll tell him.

169
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,629
Auntie Ha Na,
were you framed as a thief?

170
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,269
No, I'd never get framed.

171
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:38,840
Let's go.

172
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,009
Let's go.

173
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:44,940
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

174
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:56,220
Should I call the police?

175
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,830
No.

176
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,730
It hasn't even been a day.
I seem too impatient, right?

177
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,230
It must be tough to do,
but please relax.

178
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,169
Okay.

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,870
It's the detective
for the inauguration ceremony case.

180
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,309
Hello, Detective.

181
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,580
Is that so? I see.

182
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:24,879
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

183
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,720
He finished investigating.

184
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,690
His claims as a victim
that you were a corporate raider...

185
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,460
turned out to be
slander without ground.

186
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,690
The case has been transferred
to the prosecution.

187
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,429
The prosecution investigation will
help us find whoever is behind him.

188
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,799
Tell our legal team
that I'll settle...

189
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,070
- if he tells me who's behind him.
- Yes.

190
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,269
Should I escort you
back to the office?

191
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,210
I don't think
I can get any work done anyway.

192
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,309
Let's go home.

193
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,279
Yes.

194
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,379
The prosecution will focus on
finding who's behind him.

195
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,950
Chairwoman Shin may try to coax him,

196
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,549
so let's be ready to fight that.

197
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,149
Yes, I'll relay that.

198
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,620
How are things with Hwang Jin Goo?

199
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,929
He'll catch a break after he signs
with Gana Hotel today.

200
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,929
Then, let's get moving
with the Dubai contract.

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,500
Hwang Jin Goo will notice
if we make a move now.

202
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,799
He stepped up
and even bet Hyesung Tour.

203
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,639
We should cut it down
when we have a chance.

204
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,639
I'll offer Hassan a deal
that is hard to turn down.

205
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,039
(Travel Destinations by Preference)

206
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,710
(Means of Transportation)

207
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,980
She stole
Ms. Yoon's envelope with money.

208
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,779
I can't believe that.

209
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,220
She must be out of her mind.

210
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,289
I never stole
that envelope with money.

211
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,289
I also have no idea
why it was in my bag.

212
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,899
Yes, hello.

213
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,970
Do you know the reason...

214
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,600
why the CCTV malfunctioned
in Hyesung Tour's corridor?

215
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,309
Not yet? When do you think...

216
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,179
All right.

217
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,350
Gosh, it's taking forever.

218
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,570
Ms. Yoon?

219
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,740
Ms. Goo.

220
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,679
Oh. Hello, President Hwang.

221
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,210
What are you doing in the corridor?

222
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,250
Why are you out here?

223
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

224
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,820
Speak for yourself.

225
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,590
You seem like a real heiress
after acting like one for a while.

226
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,490
Has the real heiress died?

227
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:52,330
Yu Jin will never show up again.

228
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,500
If what Mom said was true,
she will never show up.

229
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,600
- Mr. Yoon.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,509
- Move Ms. Goo's desk back inside.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,710
- President Hwang.
- Now.

232
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,639
- Yes, sir.
- Ms. Yoon, come to my office.

233
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,049
Even so,
you can't pull out her desk.

234
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,120
I did it to kick her out.

235
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,690
I already warned her...

236
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,090
that she'd get struck out
after three strikes.

237
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,360
- "Three strikes?"
- My shoes. The sexual harassment.

238
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,730
- And now, a theft.
- I did that to your shoe.

239
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:24,799
She was a victim
of sexual harassment.

240
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:27,600
And we were yet to know
if she really was a thief.

241
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,039
The envelope was in her bag.
What more do I need?

242
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,970
Did I have to believe her
when she said it wasn't her?

243
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,909
She's under my order.

244
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:37,210
- You stay out of this.
- There was a chance...

245
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:40,539
the CCTV in the corridor was
tampered with just during lunch.

246
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,309
She said that to me, too.

247
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,350
The security office isn't stupid.
How can anyone tamper with that?

248
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,350
They're finding the cause,
so you need to wait.

249
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,820
If she were confirmed
as the perpetrator,

250
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,690
then you could punish
or dismiss her.

251
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,860
As you know,
I'm signing with Gana Hotel today.

252
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm leaving.

253
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:08,840
Head of Security.

254
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,440
Hello, President Hwang.

255
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,049
I heard the corridor CCTV
malfunctioned at lunch yesterday.

256
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,779
Have you found the reason?

257
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,919
Well, at times, the cameras can
malfunction for some unknown reason,

258
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,519
so it's hard for us to find out why.

259
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,960
They shouldn't malfunction.

260
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,059
Why do we have a security office
if you'll blame just the machine?

261
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,399
We already had a problem
at the inauguration ceremony.

262
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,059
If problems continue to break out,

263
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,429
the security office will face
much worse than a punishment.

264
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,669
President Hwang.

265
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,440
Head of Security, you may leave.

266
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,779
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,639
I was talking to him.

268
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,179
The security office is here
for all of Hyesung Group.

269
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,950
You're stepping over the line
to hold him responsible...

270
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,649
as a mere president
of an affiliated company.

271
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,450
Punishing the security team is
my authority.

272
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,220
Please stay within the line.

273
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,019
Then, please use your authority
to help vindicate Ms. Goo Ha Na.

274
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,190
Without cooperation
from the security office,

275
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,059
she'd take the blame as a thief
and would end up fired.

276
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,369
I can't let one of my staff
get fired like that.

277
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,170
May I ask you for a favor?

278
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,869
Were you sure she was framed?

279
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,269
I trust my staff.

280
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,309
You love your staff greatly.

281
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,579
I take that as a compliment.

282
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,609
Right, you knew the rampage
at your inauguration ceremony...

283
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,980
was transferred...

284
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,349
- to the prosecution, right?
- Right.

285
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,819
You didn't seem to care,
although it happened at your ceremony.

286
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,289
You told the chairwoman...

287
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,630
you'd find out if he was a lone man
or if he had anyone behind him.

288
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,559
The prosecution has the case now,
so I'll trust them and wait.

289
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,400
Anyway, Mr. Hwang.

290
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,500
Shouldn't you focus more
on the bet you have going with me?

291
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,569
Hyesung Tour's survival
depends on it.

292
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,410
That's why I'm on my way
to signing a contract...

293
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,640
with Gana Hotel,
where the guests from Dubai will stay.

294
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm busy, so please excuse me.

295
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,720
How interesting.

296
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:09,859
She must've hated me so much
to do something like that.

297
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,970
This video will
stop her from harassing me, right?

298
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,470
I wonder who sent it to me.

299
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,569
It seemed like it was recorded
on the office computer.

300
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,809
Should I ask each person?

301
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,410
Ms. Yoon, are you
skipping lunch again?

302
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:33,349
I won't get caught
for tampering with the CCTV, right?

303
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,990
Should I give him more money?

304
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,519
Darn it. Everything is irritating,
including Yu Jin's issue.

305
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,359
Let's go.

306
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,799
Ha Na, are you not coming?

307
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,569
I'm meeting a friend.

308
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,809
Enjoy your lunch.

309
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,980
Ms. Goo.

310
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,049
Yes?

311
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,519
Did you ask the security office
to find the reason...

312
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,450
for the CCTV malfunction?

313
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,859
Yes, I wanted to know
who was framing me...

314
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:15,859
Don't act like a detective.

315
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,329
The security office isn't a joke.

316
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,730
It'll take months to investigate.

317
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,529
And what if it was
just a simple defect on the camera?

318
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,569
So? Are you asking me
not to pry into it?

319
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,740
Why not? Because you did it?

320
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,480
What?
What the heck is this nonsense?

321
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,250
Does this still look like nonsense?

322
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,450
You!

323
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,619
Did you just push me?

324
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,059
You!

325
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,930
I'll upload this on the intranet.

326
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,329
Go ahead and do it now.

327
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,900
It's a serious crime to spread
a Deepfake video made with my face.

328
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,700
I'll make you receive
aggravated punishment...

329
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,470
for spreading fake video
and slander on top of theft!

330
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,539
Fake video, my foot.

331
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,440
- I got it from someone, too.
- You got it? From who?

332
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:10,950
You even made an accomplice?
You're unbelievably evil.

333
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,519
I'll fire all of you!

334
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,160
There's a criminal here
at Hyesung Tour's office,

335
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,460
so arrest her immediately.

336
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,190
- What are you doing?
- Why? Are you scared?

337
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,829
Someone like you
can't win against me.

338
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,930
What a ridiculous brat.

339
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,900
Take her away!

340
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:32,869
Let go of me.

341
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,640
I'm not the criminal. It's her!

342
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,509
Let go of me! Yoon Se Young!

343
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,740
Why aren't you saying anything?

344
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:41,849
Yes.

345
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,250
What you said was right.

346
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,420
I didn't think they would
do that for me, either.

347
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,619
You're finally
starting to make sense.

348
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,759
Go to the department store
and pick up my shoes tomorrow.

349
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,730
They're back from Italy.

350
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,769
Man, look at this woman.

351
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,400
You got her.

352
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,609
She'll get kicked out
while trying to get rid of you.

353
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,309
Hey, release the video now.

354
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,250
I'd love to do that.

355
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,279
What?

356
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,619
So, you won't?

357
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,119
If I make the wrong approach to her,
it'll backfire on me.

358
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,759
She won't admit it.

359
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:28,289
She may even find the one
who sent it and give them penalty.

360
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,490
Or she may buy them out.

361
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,900
Yes, it's pretty much fantasy...

362
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,759
for a mere contract worker...

363
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,829
to easily win against an heiress.

364
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,799
So, what's your plan?

365
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,410
I'll keep the video
and vindicate myself first.

366
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,440
- Have you thought of a way?
- Yes, I have a plan.

367
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,549
Do you have 500 dollars?

368
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,349
How did you know I went to the bank
before coming here?

369
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:54,819
Are they all in 50-dollar bills?

370
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,190
- Let me borrow it.
- Have you become psychic?

371
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,190
What are you going to do?

372
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,359
The white envelope is perfect.

373
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,559
Thank you.

374
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,769
I can use this to vindicate myself.

375
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,799
- Lee, a singer and actor...
- Should I learn to read fortune?

376
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,869
who was arrested
for a hit-and-run case...

377
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,200
has settled
with the victim after a month.

378
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,410
The prosecution investigated Lee...

379
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,140
- under detention...
- If I hadn't given up,

380
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,210
could I have caught
Du Na's hit-and-run driver?

381
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,910
The actor confirmed
settling the case with the victim.

382
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,819
I heard the police could catch
most hit-and-run drivers.

383
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:28,650
Even the police had no lead,
so how could you have done it?

384
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,859
Your life was already hard
with baby Eun Chong...

385
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,660
and all your siblings back then.

386
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,960
You've done more than enough.

387
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,259
I couldn't have done it like you.

388
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,200
You're the person
I respect the most, Ha Na.

389
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,769
Sheesh. Whatever.

390
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,970
Just eat your food.

391
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,039
Next story.

392
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:51,480
An 11-year-old son
who went missing 28 years ago...

393
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,509
miraculously returned
to his family...

394
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,250
thanks to the police's system
of profiling missing persons.

395
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,480
Reported by Kim Do Young.

396
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,789
Yeo Jin! Are you home?

397
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,390
She's getting some rest
after visiting the temple.

398
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,890
The remote control.

399
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,500
I need this.

400
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,660
Can you turn off the vacuum cleaner?

401
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,869
- What's going on?
- They start crying...

402
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:16,900
holding each other tightly
in their arms.

403
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,799
The family was finally reunited...

404
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,500
- after 28 years.
- Yeo Jin!

405
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,339
You need to come out
and watch the news!

406
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:24,309
- At the time, the 11-year-old...
- Yeo Jin.

407
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:27,380
- went missing on their way to Jeju.
- Why are you making a scene?

408
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,779
- Twenty-eight years?
- He reunited with his mother...

409
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,150
and the rest of his family
after 28 years.

410
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,549
Just before her 70th birthday,
she visited the police station...

411
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,920
- last June one last time...
- I heard the news on my way out,

412
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,390
and my heart began to race.

413
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,630
I went over to watch it with you.

414
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,930
- They were reunited after 28 years!
- The police found...

415
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,700
the missing person on the system.

416
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:49,200
- Here.
- The police took their DNA...

417
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,269
- Please sit down and watch it.
- and ran a parentage test.

418
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,140
The result confirmed
this man as her son.

419
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,109
It's becoming much easier
to find separated families...

420
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,910
as more and more people take part
in the DNA registration program.

421
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,079
Reported by Kim Do Young, KBC.

422
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,650
He was missing for eight more years
than Yu Jin, but they found him.

423
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,059
You'll soon get to hold her
in your arms.

424
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,930
Yes, this time,
I'm sure she'll be your daughter.

425
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,250
All right.

426
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,359
Hey.

427
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,519
- Like this.
- My gosh.

428
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,529
Let's go.

429
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,579
Ms. Chairwoman, the wind is cold.

430
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,750
You should go back inside.

431
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,190
I need to donate more...

432
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,420
to associations of families
of missing persons.

433
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,789
Do you wish to give more
than your regular donations?

434
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,829
Find out how much I can give.

435
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,730
Also,

436
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,470
- the angry man at the ceremony.
- Yes.

437
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,470
His case was transferred
to the prosecution today.

438
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,470
I should just settle the case.

439
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,170
Chairwoman Shin settled the case?

440
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,109
Yes, all she wanted was
for him not to slander her again.

441
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,450
She didn't even want money.

442
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,880
That's a sudden change of events.

443
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:47,779
Did something happen
to make her change her mind?

444
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,420
That's what I'm looking into.

445
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,259
According to Zero,
President Hwang...

446
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,660
went to her office in the afternoon
and left work together.

447
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,160
They must've gone somewhere.

448
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,559
That's what I'm trying to find out.

449
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,869
And I heard back from Hassan.

450
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,569
They can't accept our offer...

451
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,900
because Ms. Goo Ha Na is
their exclusive guide.

452
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,339
My sister is getting in the way.

453
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,240
We wouldn't have a problem
with guests from Dubai...

454
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,740
now that we got signed
with Gana Hotel.

455
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,509
I'll also sign with other hotels,
so don't worry about it.

456
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,150
Good work, everyone.

457
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,250
- You, too, Mr. Hwang.
- You, too, Mr. Hwang.

458
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,819
Ms. Goo, contact potential
tourist spots for Dubai guests.

459
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,960
- Set up a meeting next week.
- Yes, sir.

460
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,839
Ms. Yoon, I have something to say.

461
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,609
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

462
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:48,710
The envelope was my mistake.

463
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,009
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,450
You're finally spilling the truth?

465
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,490
The envelope I gave you...

466
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,950
wasn't the one from your mother.

467
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,559
That money was
for my nephew's kindergarten.

468
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,029
I forgot to turn it in
and had kept it with me.

469
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,759
What?

470
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,269
Wait, did you just say
the envelopes were switched?

471
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,500
Yes.

472
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:15,609
This is the envelope
from your mother.

473
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:22,150
I picked it up
under your desk at lunch.

474
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,809
It must've been stuck in the drawer,
then fallen off.

475
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,220
Do you expect me to believe you?

476
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,880
It's not even anyone else. It's you.

477
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,450
If you don't believe me,

478
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,619
I'll track the reason
for the CCTV malfunction...

479
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,490
with the security office
and find out who's framing...

480
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,630
Wait, so...

481
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,430
the envelope I put in my drawer
was always there,

482
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,170
then I mistook your envelope
for the one my mom gave you?

483
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,269
Yes, that's exactly it.

484
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,769
So, there were no culprits,

485
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,140
- and you were framed?
- Yes.

486
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,680
No, you were the culprit.

487
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,720
So, in conclusion,
you didn't steal anything,

488
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,819
so you want your money back?

489
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,960
I'm sorry to ask,
but please do that for me.

490
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,359
It might be better
to end this here...

491
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:10,690
instead of dragging this out
and making my life hard.

492
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,630
Darn it. I can't tell...

493
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,630
if she's making this move
because she knows something.

494
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,009
Anyway, I thought
Goo Ha Na got quite clever.

495
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,309
You said it was true.

496
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,680
I should believe her.
What else can I do?

497
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,480
As you said,
she was one of my subordinates.

498
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,420
Try this. It's good.

499
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,930
Aunt Yeo Jin must trust you
more than me.

500
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,369
She went with you
to sample her DNA...

501
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,609
and took you to the temple
early in the morning.

502
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:58,210
Good for you, Jin Goo.

503
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,710
She picked up the call
in front of me.

504
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,109
And as for the temple,
she knows you aren't a morning person.

505
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,309
Jeez.

506
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,019
Try this, too.

507
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,460
It's good.

508
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,490
It's efficient and easy to eat
whatever you want to your taste.

509
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,529
Aunt Yeo Jin has high hopes, right?

510
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:25,269
That was why she settled the case
at the inauguration ceremony.

511
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,269
Yes, I hope she's the one.

512
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:31,069
I'm looking forward to it, too.

513
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,079
I wonder
what she's like as a grownup.

514
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,980
She's now 31, not 10,
so she must be completely different.

515
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,579
She doesn't have any memories
prior to her disappearance,

516
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,819
so she won't remember you, either.

517
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,950
It doesn't matter.
I'll tell her everything.

518
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,170
Let's get her shoes,

519
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,769
go to a kids' cafe
because you love that,

520
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:59,539
- and eat something delicious, too!
- Okay!

521
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,769
The department store?

522
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,539
You must be tired
after dedicating 3,000 bows.

523
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,049
I reserved an aromatherapy session.

524
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,980
They had a new benefit
available in the VIP lounge.

525
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,089
I also prepared a present
for Yu Jin, too.

526
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:21,059
So, please take a look
and pick one out.

527
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,329
You can do it after the result.
You don't have to rush it.

528
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:29,500
We have so many things to do
with her after the result comes out.

529
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,670
She's right.
We have to get ready now.

530
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,369
Let's get you some clothes.

531
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,910
Where are the discount stores
for children's clothing?

532
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,109
- Auntie Ha Na, come here.
- Yes?

533
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,920
Where are you going?

534
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,019
Eun Chong, I don't need any clothes.

535
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:56,990
You're free to try them on.

536
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:00,029
I'll take pictures of you
in pretty clothes.

537
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,799
Hello. Please come in
and try some on.

538
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,109
Try that one.

539
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,839
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

540
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,970
Thank you.

541
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,410
Eun Chong.

542
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,319
Why did you run out alone?

543
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,559
Oh, my. Hello, Chairwoman Shin.

544
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,759
- Ms. Goo.
- Yes.

545
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,130
Right. Say hello to her, Eun Chong.

546
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,829
She's the chairwoman
of my workplace.

547
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,000
The chairwoman?

548
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,339
Then, is that the highest position?

549
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,609
Yes.

550
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,170
Hello.

551
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,079
My name is Lee Eun Chong...

552
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,880
of Chamsae Class
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

553
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,599
(Cinderella Game)

554
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,470
A powerful variable
has come into the picture.

555
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,940
What will happen...

556
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,970
to Hwang Jin Goo and Yoon Se Young
if her daughter comes back?

557
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,440
Find out her appearance
and what she was wearing.

558
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,940
Find out whatever you can.

559
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,009
Director Goo lives in our apartment?
Are you serious?

560
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,579
Has Richard Han decided
on the date of his return?

561
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,720
I look forward to seeing
your work at full power.

562
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,250
I hope you're prepared,
Director Goo.

563
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,250
Yes, do you have the result?

564
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,559
Where is Eun Chong's grandmother?
