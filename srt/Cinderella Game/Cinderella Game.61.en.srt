1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,009
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,179
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,779
Auntie Ha Na, look. It's Mommy.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,619
"Mommy?"

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,919
It's a photo of my mommy.

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,989
It's a flyer looking for Du Na.

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,820
Where did you get this?

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,699
Yoon Yu Jin, age ten.

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,270
What is this?

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,210
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,439
Du Na is Yoon Yu Jin?

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,109
Why is Du Na...

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,750
Do you want me to tell you
who she is?

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,719
She's the real one.

16
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,420
What?

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,390
She's the real one.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,429
You're a fake. A knockoff.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,229
A replica.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,269
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,810
What do you mean by real and fake?

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,280
She's the real Yoon Yu Jin,

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,180
and you're a fake.

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,180
Du Na is the real one,

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,750
and I'm a fake?

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,689
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:29,760
Sure. You probably can't believe it.

28
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,129
You wouldn't want to.

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,329
But what can you do? It's true.

30
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,670
I told you about that girl
who got conned, right?

31
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,769
I was talking about you.

32
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,310
You were the reason
why I had been laughing so hard.

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,510
It was so funny...

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,450
when I found out you were a fake.

35
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,519
Who said I was a fake?

36
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,719
That piece of newspaper says it all.

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,349
Don't you believe it
even after seeing it?

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,590
That's enough.

39
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,719
I don't believe you,

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,189
and I don't believe this, either.

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,530
That makes no sense.

42
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,000
That nonsense already happened.
What can you do?

43
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,099
I'll ask Mom myself.

44
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,169
Will your fake mom
tell you the truth?

45
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,770
Go ahead and ask.

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,710
If you have more questions,
you can come to me.

47
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,949
Yoon Yu Jin, age ten.

48
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,659
I was Yoon Yu Jin,
but I went missing at seven.

49
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,960
The age of your disappearance?

50
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,530
You went missing at seven.

51
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,199
I saw it in a news article.

52
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,870
Wasn't I wrong?

53
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,409
Weren't you seven?

54
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm Ha Na's mom,
so how can he be her dad?

55
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,979
Then, what about
your daughter's disappearance?

56
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,250
I believe she went missing at ten.

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,219
But Ha Na came to my place at ten.

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,229
But this can't be a lie.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,780
How will you explain this?

60
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,310
Mom and I did a parentage test, too.

61
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,620
The parentage test result?

62
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,050
Of course, it was fabricated.

63
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,490
Aunt Yeo Jin went all-out
to deceive you.

64
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,330
This was faked, too?

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,400
Don't you want to know
why she made you...

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,099
a fake daughter?

67
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,509
She wanted to protect the real one.

68
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,840
- "The real one?"
- Someone Yu Jin left behind.

69
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,740
Your nephew.

70
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,009
Lee Eun Chong.

71
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,250
Aunt Yeo Jin's only blood.

72
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,959
We should probably leave now.

73
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,540
She made me...

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,980
her fake daughter
to protect Eun Chong?

75
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,649
If she tells the world
that Eun Chong is her grandson,

76
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,279
evil people may come
and try to hurt him.

77
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,779
She lost Yu Jin already,
and she couldn't lose her grandson.

78
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,750
So, she made you her fake daughter
and used you as his shield.

79
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,790
He'd be safe
if he was in your shadows.

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,990
Do you get it now?

81
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,800
No, you're lying.

82
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't believe you.

83
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,170
You want the worst for me.

84
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,939
You don't want the world to know
that I'm her daughter.

85
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,509
That's why you're coming up
with this total nonsense.

86
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,009
It's up to you to believe it or not.

87
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,079
You can either choose to live
as her fake daughter...

88
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,339
or leave this place.

89
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,209
No.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,649
No.

91
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,350
Auntie Ha Na,
why aren't we going to the hotel?

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,860
What? Yes. We should go.

93
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,360
Let me get my bag.

94
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,139
- Let's go.
- Will you introduce yourself...

95
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,269
as her fake daughter
in front of a crowd?

96
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,910
Get a grip on yourself.

97
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,879
You aren't Yoon Yu Jin.
You're Goo Ha Na.

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,050
You're Yoon Yu Jin's knockoff.

99
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,550
Don't you want to know
why she made you a fake daughter?

100
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,189
She wanted to protect the real one.

101
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,060
Auntie Ha Na...

102
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,839
Auntie Ha Na...

103
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,790
How did this end up in your room?

104
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,360
I have no idea. It's really odd.

105
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,129
Here? Where?

106
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,000
Which one?

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,170
Mom, why are you watching this
instead of sleeping?

108
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,240
Peek-a-boo.

109
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,870
What are you doing?

110
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,769
Put my grandson down right now!

111
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,480
Du Na, you tell me.

112
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,180
Are you the real Yoon Yu Jin?

113
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,519
Am I a fake?

114
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,490
She lost Yu Jin already,
and she couldn't lose her grandson.

115
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,000
So, she made you her fake daughter
and used you as his shield.

116
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,639
Someone is looking for you.

117
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,540
Who's looking for me?

118
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,209
Someone who may be
your biological mother.

119
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,540
The chairwoman...

120
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,379
lost her daughter by the sea
when she was seven.

121
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,480
Then, I don't think
I'm who you're looking for.

122
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,319
I lost my father in a fire
when I was seven,

123
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:29,949
then sent to a children's home.

124
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,519
Was my name...

125
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,430
Yu Jin?

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,860
Yes. You were Yu Jin.

127
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,730
Yoon Yu Jin.

128
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,269
Yu Jin...

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,300
No, we haven't started yet.

130
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,430
Even I'm nervous about this.

131
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,540
It's the first day she goes public
as the chairwoman's daughter.

132
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,509
Make sure you escort Ms. Goo well.

133
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,540
Okay. Don't worry about it.

134
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:26,839
Bye.

135
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,519
Hello.

136
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,090
Congratulations.

137
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,590
Thank you.

138
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,100
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

139
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,200
- Is Yu Jin here?
- No.

140
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,600
I'll check and see
if she's on her way.

141
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,509
Hey, Se Young. Are you on your way?

142
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,840
What?

143
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,009
Why?

144
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:07,389
Okay. I got it. I'm hanging up.

145
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,590
Yeo Jin, she said...

146
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,159
Yu Jin felt under the weather
and couldn't come here.

147
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,730
What do you mean she can't come?
She was fine this morning.

148
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,529
- Call Yu Jin.
- Okay.

149
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,370
- She won't pick up.
- I'll call her.

150
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,450
Why did Ha Na lock herself
in her room...

151
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,450
and not answer her phone?

152
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,559
She won't say anything.
How would I know?

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,889
Did something happen?

154
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,029
Tell her to call me
when she comes out of her room.

155
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,539
Ha Na won't pick up her phone.

156
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,139
Se Young also doesn't know
what's going on.

157
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,210
The bodyguards also say
she hasn't left the house.

158
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,379
Maybe she found out she was a fake.

159
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,179
I'm suspicious of that, too.

160
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,080
I'll tell the bodyguards
to withdraw.

161
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,190
- What about Mr. Han?
- Let him know.

162
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,870
He is so attached to Ha Na.

163
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,240
Will we ever separate him from her?

164
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,139
Anyway, what's she up to?
She locked herself in there.

165
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,740
Did she collapse after crying?

166
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,519
Auntie Ha Na.

167
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,700
Everyone made time to be there
when I said I'd present...

168
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
the daughter I found after 20 years.

169
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,139
This was a huge embarrassment.

170
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,539
Tell the board to keep quiet
and send them something.

171
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,940
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,049
Yu Jin, are you all right?

173
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,149
I heard you weren't well.

174
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,289
How are you unwell?

175
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,090
How sick did you have to be...

176
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,059
that you dared not to come
to the day of your introduction?

177
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,559
"Introduction?"

178
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,700
What's wrong?

179
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,169
Why did you do this to me?

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,809
- Do what?
- Why did you do this to me?

181
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,840
I don't understand.
You need to explain yourself.

182
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,080
You already know...

183
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,679
what I'm talking about.

184
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,580
Ms. Yu Jin,
you can talk to her inside.

185
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:01,029
If you have something to say,
come inside.

186
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,539
Yu Jin.

187
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,240
"Yu Jin?"

188
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,240
Who's Yu Jin?

189
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,980
There's no Yu Jin here.

190
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,549
What are you talking about?

191
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,279
You're here, Yu Jin.

192
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,090
I have to talk to Yu Jin,
so take Eun Chong and go out.

193
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,320
Is this something serious?

194
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,659
I wanted to stick around
and see them fight. What a bummer.

195
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,669
Eun Chong, come with Little Grandma.

196
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,600
Auntie Ha Na...

197
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,169
It's okay. You can go.

198
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,269
Let's go, Eun Chong.

199
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,679
You may leave, Ms. Jang.

200
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,820
I'll be outside on standby.

201
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,620
Let's sit down.

202
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,269
How did you know?

203
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,779
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

204
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,279
I hoped you wouldn't find out...

205
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,659
until Eun Chong came of age,
but you found out too soon.

206
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,429
How much do you know?

207
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,730
You must've known
that Eun Chong was my grandson.

208
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,659
Do you have more questions?

209
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,740
I had to do this for Eun Chong.

210
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,039
And in the end, it was for you, too.

211
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,970
You did this for me?

212
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,210
Then, you should've asked me first.

213
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,750
You should've asked
if I wanted this or not!

214
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,919
You would've wanted it.

215
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,190
What other choice did you have?

216
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,629
Did you think...

217
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,159
I would have wanted this too?

218
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,370
(Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na are
biologically related.)

219
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,169
Families of missing persons
and orphans...

220
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:29,070
cling desperately
to a piece of paper like this.

221
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,110
How can you tamper with this file
to deceive me?

222
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,720
And you made all this effort
to make me your daughter...

223
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,919
because of Eun Chong?

224
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,919
I don't care what the reason is.
You can't do something like this!

225
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,360
All right.

226
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,029
It wasn't a wise decision.

227
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,799
But it was...

228
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,759
the best decision I could make...

229
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:55,769
for you, Eun Chong, and me.

230
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,970
It was a decision you made
only for yourself.

231
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,940
Eun Chong and I never wanted
to be in this situation.

232
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,470
Do you really think so?

233
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,909
Would you have declined
to become Cinderella?

234
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:09,950
You would've thought about it,

235
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,320
but in the end,

236
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
things wouldn't have been different.

237
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,820
At the very least, I wouldn't have
been fooled into moving here!

238
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,320
I wouldn't have been so happy
to move in here,

239
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,490
not realizing I was fooled!

240
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,129
But I provide
enough compensation in return.

241
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,299
"Compensation?"

242
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,570
I've deceived you,

243
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,340
but I sincerely tried my best...

244
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,169
to think of you
and treat you like Yu Jin.

245
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,240
No.

246
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,080
That's not what sincerity means.

247
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,179
If you had a hint of sincerity,

248
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,750
you should've asked me
to become your fake daughter!

249
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,889
You wouldn't have gone this far
just to make a fool out of me!

250
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,820
How wasn't I sincere?

251
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,360
I even prepared an event
to present you as my daughter.

252
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,730
That's what I call sincerity.

253
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,559
You were the one
who refused to show up.

254
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,100
How can I show up there?
I'm just a fake.

255
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,740
I'm not your daughter.

256
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,840
I was Yoon Yu Jin's knockoff,

257
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,409
and I didn't even know it.

258
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,610
Who cares if you're fake or real?
That's not important.

259
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,210
If you had feigned ignorance,

260
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,679
you would've
become my real daughter,

261
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,220
and you could've adopted Eun Chong.

262
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,190
If you ignore just this moment,
even Hyesung Group can be yours!

263
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,389
Enough!

264
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,919
Stop.

265
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,990
You need to calm down.

266
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,049
Drink some water.

267
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,430
And have a seat.

268
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,440
You must feel resentful and bitter
with this sense of betrayal,

269
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:18,309
but you'll understand me
after some time.

270
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,109
I lived 30 years of my life,

271
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,079
never even thinking
of my birth mother.

272
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,119
One day, I heard my birth mother...

273
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,960
had been looking for me,
so I went to meet her.

274
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,130
And you walked in.

275
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,960
I was amazed that
I actually had a birth mother,

276
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,099
someone I didn't know anything of,
and she was you, the chairwoman.

277
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,900
So, I didn't believe it.

278
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,910
I thought I was too ambitious
just to imagine...

279
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,279
something like that
could happen to me.

280
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,980
Did you know
what went through my mind...

281
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,089
when that dream became reality?

282
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,690
"I must've been blessed
for living my life so diligently."

283
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,200
"Eun Chong and my siblings..."

284
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,559
"won't have to suffer anymore."

285
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,539
I wondered what I could do
to comfort my mom,

286
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,069
who went around
looking for me for 20 years.

287
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,269
I did my best to be a good daughter.

288
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,450
I was so happy
that I found my birth mother,

289
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,920
but everything was a scam?

290
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,259
I planned to make you
my real daughter.

291
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,920
I hoped no one would ever find out.

292
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,390
Even if you had found out,
I thought you'd be happy...

293
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,930
living Yu Jin's life.

294
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,230
Who made you the judge
and the decision-maker of my life?

295
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,369
I'd admit that
I took advantage of you.

296
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,109
But you also benefited from this.

297
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,480
It's not too late for me to take you
as my adopted daughter.

298
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,880
I'll help you adopt Eun Chong, too.

299
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:08,349
Then, you'd become happy
just as you wanted.

300
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,019
Even if that happened,

301
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,759
I wouldn't be happy anymore.

302
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,529
I thought you knew much of the world
after working your socks off,

303
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,400
but you still had a long way to go.

304
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,269
If you accept my offer,

305
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,740
you'll become my daughter.

306
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,670
Everyone is dying
to become a rich family's daughter.

307
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,769
I'm offering you that
for raising Eun Chong.

308
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,809
But still, you decline.

309
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,809
Do you even feel bad for me?

310
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,119
You made a fool out of me,

311
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,279
deceived me,
and took advantage of me.

312
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,049
But you don't seem to show
a hint of guilt...

313
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,890
or share an apology.

314
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,029
I don't need to hear anything else.
You need to apologize first!

315
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,730
I can apologize a hundred times,
even a thousand times.

316
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,769
Is that what you want?

317
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,640
It doesn't matter if I want it.
An apology is due, period!

318
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,539
You need to apologize first
before you feel me out...

319
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:04,210
and play with your words
like a coward!

320
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,339
I apologize.

321
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,920
That kind of apology was
better left unsaid.

322
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,849
You don't even want that apology,
so what do you expect from me?

323
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,119
Turn everything back...

324
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,829
to its place.

325
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,700
"Back to its place?"

326
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,069
I'm moving out with Eun Chong.

327
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,900
You can't take him.

328
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,910
He's my grandson and my blood.

329
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:40,109
If you want to move out,
you can leave alone.

330
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,750
I offered everything,
but you've declined.

331
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,009
It leaves me no option.

332
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,950
I'll compensate you
for raising Eun Chong to this day.

333
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,059
So, leave quietly
when Eun Chong isn't around.

334
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,589
Mom...

335
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,230
Mom...

336
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,849
She declined everything I offered.
What can I do?

337
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,259
I told her to leave Eun Chong here
and leave.

338
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,359
You should consider Eun Chong.

339
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,529
He should get used to living here.

340
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,799
At first, it'll be hard,
but he'll get used to it.

341
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,470
Where did Myung Ji go with him?

342
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,269
They went
to Ms. Se Young's newlywed home.

343
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,210
Tell her to keep Eun Chong safe.

344
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,710
Anyway, who could've sent
that delivery?

345
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:25,450
I'll check if it's a victim
of corporate raiding.

346
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,619
Okay.

347
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,359
It's Mr. Hwang.

348
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,130
I should tell him, too.

349
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:39,200
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

350
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,029
Ha Na found out everything.

351
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:46,799
- She found out she was a fake?
- Yes.

352
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,140
How is she?

353
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,609
She said
she'd move out with Eun Chong.

354
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:53,079
I'll be there now.

355
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,890
I have to adopt him
and raise him as my son?

356
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,119
I can do that
if I can be Hyesung's successor.

357
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,200
Ms. Jang told us
to stay here with him...

358
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,099
instead of coming home.

359
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,769
Did Goo Ha Na say
she'd move out with him?

360
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,640
What if Yeo Jin convinces her...

361
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,009
by offering to adopt her
and talks her into staying?

362
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,710
When can we go home?

363
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,480
We'll leave a little later.

364
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,180
Are Grandma and Auntie Ha Na
not done talking?

365
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,619
Something happened to Ha Na, right?

366
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,660
She must've used her condition
as an excuse.

367
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,190
I think something else is going on.

368
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,660
I'm busy.

369
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,130
Tell me. What's going on?

370
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,700
Did she find out
she was a fake daughter?

371
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,640
She did.

372
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,670
I told you...

373
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,470
I'd expose
your hideous nature for what it was.

374
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,309
You shouldn't have let her find out
if you made her a fake daughter!

375
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,180
What will you do now?

376
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,250
We'll talk later.

377
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,920
Both you and I must have
a lot to say.

378
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,460
How did she find out she was a fake?

379
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,359
So, I guess it wasn't you.

380
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,529
Why would I do that?

381
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:22,000
You could've done that and more
in the past.

382
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,049
Ha Na found out
she was a fake daughter.

383
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,980
It must be tough for her.

384
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,990
Someone must've targeted the day
she would've gone public.

385
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:46,819
Chairwoman Shin wouldn't plot
something this risky.

386
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
If someone tried to stop her
from becoming public,

387
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,190
could it be
Yoon Se Young and her mom?

388
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,500
They're the most likely.

389
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,430
We can find out who it was...

390
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,099
once we learn
how she discovered the truth.

391
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:10,950
Why don't you consider Eun Chong
and let the chairwoman adopt you?

392
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,750
I don't want to stay
under this roof for another second.

393
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,190
I'm leaving with Eun Chong.

394
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,289
The chairwoman won't allow it.

395
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,390
Ms. Jang.

396
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,230
Did you also help her
turn me into a fake daughter?

397
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,000
- And Mr. Hwang, too.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,539
I'm here to do
whatever the chairwoman wants.

399
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,440
Mr. Hwang was against this
adamantly.

400
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,180
He got into this...

401
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,980
because he sincerely wanted you
to be happy.

402
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,789
It doesn't matter. He deceived me.

403
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,750
Where's Eun Chong?

404
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,559
Ms. Choi is with him.

405
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,359
Tell me where he is.

406
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,859
- She's packing up?
- Yes, ma'am.

407
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,630
She wants to leave with Eun Chong.

408
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,470
She asked where he was,

409
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,240
but I said I didn't know.

410
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,049
Ha Na, are you okay?

411
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,750
Ji Seok.

412
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,990
Can you find Eun Chong?

413
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,359
What about Eun Chong?
Is he not home?

414
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,730
Yoon Se Young left with him,
but I couldn't reach her.

415
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,329
I'm leaving this place.

416
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,630
- I've been...
- I know everything.

417
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,069
You don't have to tell me.

418
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,779
You didn't do anything wrong.

419
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,579
I'll look for Eun Chong,

420
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,819
so calm down and wait.

421
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,490
(Yoon Se Young)

422
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,630
The phone is turned off.

423
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,400
Please leave a message
after the tone.

424
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,569
Hey, It's me.

425
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:13,069
Is there a place
where Eun Chong could be?

426
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,500
Eun Chong?

427
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Isn't he with Ha Na
at her announcement?

428
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,579
Where are you?

429
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,410
Is that Ji Seok?
Did Ha Na's speech go well?

430
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,910
What's going on?

431
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:25,950
Okay.

432
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,789
He asked me to look for Eun Chong.
What's going on?

433
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:34,059
What? She lost him again?

434
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,509
The fake daughter play is over,

435
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,750
so you need to get rid of the props.

436
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,450
Do you have to leave?

437
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,420
Then, leave
Eun Chong's luggage here.

438
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,349
I am his guardian.

439
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,859
He's my blood.

440
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:08,490
It doesn't matter.
You have zero legal rights over him.

441
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,559
If you feel
even a little bad for me,

442
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,230
then let me leave with Eun Chong.

443
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,130
Take his luggage from her.

444
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,839
- Ms. Ha Na.
- Ask Eun Chong...

445
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,599
who he wants to live with.

446
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:24,609
I'll return his luggage
if he wants to live with you.

447
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,480
Ha Na.

448
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,160
Ha Na!

449
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:43,259
What should I do, Ms. Chairwoman?

450
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,200
What can I do? She decided to leave.

451
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,170
I can't put a leash on her
and drag her back.

452
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,740
Tell them to bring Eun Chong home.

453
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,839
Let me drive you.

454
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,180
- I can explain everything.
- Let it go.

455
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:05,049
I don't need an explanation...

456
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:06,680
from someone
who made me a fake daughter.

457
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,450
I'm sorry for everything.

458
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,190
I'll gladly receive any punishment.

459
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,759
"Punishment?"

460
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,130
It felt like
I was getting punished right now.

461
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,839
Hey, Ji Seok. Where's Eun Chong?

462
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,880
Yoon Se Young's phone is off,

463
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,339
so I need to track her location.

464
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,980
Please wait in that house.

465
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:39,980
I already left.

466
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,750
What about Eun Chong?

467
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,519
Se Young is with Eun Chong,

468
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:50,289
but her phone is off,
so I can't find him.

469
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:53,359
He's in my newlywed home.

470
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,500
- Are you happy to go home?
- Yes.

471
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,480
Can you call Auntie Ha Na?

472
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:06,880
Why?

473
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,450
I'm going home now,
so I want to tell her to wait.

474
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,720
Auntie Ha Na should be home.

475
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:16,349
It's a cold day.

476
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,119
Eun Chong.

477
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,759
Eun Chong!

478
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,170
He's not here.

479
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,069
(Se Young)

480
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,140
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

481
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,880
Hello, Mother. Where's Se Young?

482
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,920
She's home. Why?

483
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,779
All right.

484
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,160
We must've missed him.
They went home.

485
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,730
Auntie Ha Na.

486
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,430
Where is she?

487
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,609
Auntie Ha Na...

488
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,109
Where's the family photo?

489
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:21,049
Goo Ha Na threw it on the floor.

490
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:22,990
No way. I'm glad.

491
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,390
It would've felt so ominous
if her photo had still been up.

492
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,259
Right?

493
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,029
Where's Auntie Ha Na?

494
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,630
Hey, is she not there?

495
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,900
Her clothes, my clothes,

496
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,670
and the photos are all gone.

497
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,140
Why are you crying, Eun Chong?

498
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,880
Where did Auntie Ha Na go?

499
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,230
No.

500
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,099
Is that Auntie Ha Na?

501
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,700
What? No.

502
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:22,009
Open the door.

503
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,210
Open the door!

504
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,750
Eun Chong!

505
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,089
Open the door.

506
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:30,619
They even changed the passcode.

507
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,359
Eun Chong!

508
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,589
- Eun Chong, it's me.
- Auntie Ha Na!

509
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,730
Hold him.

510
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,829
- No, you can't go, Eun Chong.
- No, Eun Chong.

511
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,069
I want to go to Auntie Ha Na!

512
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,529
- No.
- No.

513
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,670
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Goodness. No.

514
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,740
Auntie Ha Na!

515
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,039
Eun Chong.

516
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,539
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Eun Chong, I'm here.

517
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:54,910
Eun Chong!

518
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,779
- Eun Chong, no.
- Auntie Ha Na...

519
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,220
Eun Chong!

520
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,920
- Open the door, please!
- Auntie Ha Na!

521
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,089
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie Ha Na!

522
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,460
Eun Chong!

523
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,880
(Cinderella Game)

524
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,109
- He's...
- He's...

525
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,809
- Yu Jin's son?
- Yu Jin's son?

526
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,480
I shouldn't have
moved out of that place.

527
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,489
We have to report them
to the police right now...

528
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,389
and destroy that family!

529
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,690
I will get the revenge.

530
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,360
Hello? Eun Chong.

531
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,130
Eun Chong,
who do you want to live with?

532
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,289
Auntie Ha Na or Grandma?

You need to apologize wholeheartedly

You made Goo Ha Na

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,300
Only your fight
with Chairwoman Shin remains.

536
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,699
It's finally my time to aim
for Chairwoman Shin's neck.
