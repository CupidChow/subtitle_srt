1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,069
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,439
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,940
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,650
(Episode 23)

5
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:10,380
How old are you?

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,779
I'm seven years old.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,279
You're seven?

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,859
My grandson must be as big as you.

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,289
Is your grandson here?

10
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,890
- No.
- Then?

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:25,899
I don't know yet.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,469
Jin Goo.

13
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,009
I need to find my grandson
right now.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,039
I'll do every possible thing I can
to find him.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,780
Why don't you wait
until Mr. Yoon replies...

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,950
I don't need him.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,020
It feels like
he's trying to torture me to death.

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,950
How can he be
this cold and heartless?

19
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,049
He must know how I feel,

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,990
but he's only watching
like we're total strangers.

21
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:57,130
I'll find him on my own.

22
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,739
Hey, Grandpa.

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,310
"Grandpa?"

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,849
Can you help me instead of Grandpa?

25
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,379
My kite is stuck in a tree.

26
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,319
- You should go.
- Okay.

27
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,019
Let's go.

28
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,420
Come on.

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,469
My handkerchief...

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,010
She's searching for Eun Chong
so desperately.

31
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,180
I'm afraid people will hear that
he's of Hyesung Group's blood...

32
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:51,180
because of her reckless efforts
to find him.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,989
What if you told her who he was...

34
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,590
and that she shouldn't disclose
he was of Hyesung Group's blood?

35
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,260
She and her people will
find Eun Chong very soon.

36
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,300
Excuse me.

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,439
- May I come in?
- Oh, may I help you?

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,169
I must've left my handkerchief here.

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,479
Is this it?

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,610
Yes, thank you.

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,719
What's wrong?

42
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:32,990
It's nothing.

43
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:41,569
She left.

44
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,080
You came home early today.

45
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,610
Jin Goo, how did you end up
accompanying her home?

46
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,180
Ms. Jang was feeling
under the weather.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,650
I see. What's this?

48
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,620
You may leave.

49
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,860
Would you like a cup of tea?

50
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,430
I don't want any.

51
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,629
All right, then.

52
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,469
- Give me the drawing.
- Yes, ma'am.

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,509
(Lee Ha Na, Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na)

54
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,620
- Jin Goo.
- Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,419
I met a man in the director's office
at the children's home.

56
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,389
Strangely, I can't forget about him.

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,389
Why? Did something happen?

58
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,330
I didn't see his face.

59
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,629
It was the bigger man
out of the two.

60
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,169
The one who was
reading the newspaper.

61
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,729
He looked older, too.

62
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,400
Please ask the children's home.

63
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,840
Did you think it could be Mr. Yoon?

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,479
I don't know,
but I have this feeling.

65
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,180
Yes, I'll look into it.

66
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,789
Yes, Ms. Jang.

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,259
Ms. Chairwoman, I have
the IP address of Mr. Yoon's e-mail.

68
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,259
Really? Where was it?

69
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,629
It was a place in America.

70
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,960
"America?"

71
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,000
Sung Ho isn't in Korea?

72
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,629
No, his entry and exit record...

73
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,670
only shows his departure
from ten years ago.

74
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,800
He has never returned to Korea
since that day.

75
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,709
He's still in America and not Korea,

76
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,810
even though he knows
Yu Jin has a son?

77
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,120
You've been looking
for Chairwoman Shin's husband?

78
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,490
- Did you think he delivered that?
- Yes.

79
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,319
If the news made her collapse,
it must've been about her daughter,

80
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,589
and her most trustworthy source
would be her husband.

81
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,889
Also, the deliveryman
also seemed suspicious.

82
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
- Why?
- He was watching...

83
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,459
as Chairwoman Shin was taken
in an ambulance,

84
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,269
and he avoided the CCTVs
by traveling in blind spots.

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,370
The delivery company
and his number were all fake, too.

86
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,439
Do you think
the deliveryman is her husband?

87
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,810
At first, I thought so,

88
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,180
but he must've hired someone.

89
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,250
Her husband has never returned
to Korea for ten years,

90
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,379
and I couldn't confirm
his whereabouts in America, either.

91
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,850
He may be living in hiding.

92
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,089
If so, life must be
that easygoing for him.

93
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,699
What did you reckon
she heard about her daughter?

94
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,160
It must be of her death.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,269
However, I did find it odd
that her recovery was too quick.

96
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,470
So, I had a feeling she received
bad news and good news.

97
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,540
"Bad news and good news?"

98
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,680
Something good enough
to console her daughter's death.

99
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,449
You jumped to a hasty conclusion.

100
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,889
There's no good news that can
console the death of one's child.

101
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,959
But there's a possibility
that her daughter has died.

102
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,790
In that case, instead of prying
into her personal life,

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,500
we should stick to our plan
and focus on Hyesung Tour.

104
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,160
Yes, sir.

105
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,899
(Lee Ha Na, Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na)

106
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,939
This is watercolor paint.

107
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,740
- First, wet your brush.
- Okay.

108
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,279
Then, dab it in paint,

109
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,250
and do this.

110
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,319
- Let me get you.
- Okay.

111
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,579
Like this.

112
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,829
Dab.

113
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,300
- Dab.
- What are you doing?

114
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,910
Dab.

115
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,550
You're in America?

116
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:57,790
You should be thinking of a way
to find and protect Yu Jin's son.

117
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:59,360
How can you idly sit around...

118
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,660
and only send me
that piece of letter?

119
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,230
How do you call yourself her dad?

120
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,129
If only you didn't lose her...

121
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,139
I wouldn't have lost her
if you came with us.

122
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,970
Your priority isn't Yu Jin...

123
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,910
or our family.

124
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,139
It was always...

125
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:25,220
your business and money.

126
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,790
Do you still think it's my fault?

127
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,500
Is that why you haven't returned?

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,899
Even though you
know Yu Jin had a son?

129
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,939
Wasn't 20 years enough?

130
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,470
Is that how much...

131
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,040
you hate me?

132
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,449
Where is your beard, Santa?

133
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,350
Christmas is over,

134
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,720
so I won't have a beard
until the next one.

135
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,959
This is a secret between you and me.

136
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,029
Okay.

137
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:19,000
Anyway, Santa,
I fought with a friend yesterday.

138
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,209
If I fight with a friend,

139
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,879
will you refuse to grant my wish?

140
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,180
You did a great job
correcting your friend...

141
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,149
when he said something wrong or bad.

142
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,579
But you shouldn't hit him, right?

143
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,750
Right.

144
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,220
I was wrong.

145
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,789
Will you grant my wish?

146
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,259
Of course, I will.

147
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,059
Thank you.

148
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,100
This hot chocolate is delicious.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,769
Anyway, Santa.
Do you know what marshmallows are?

150
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,870
Yes, I do.

151
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,570
Have you ever dipped
marshmallow in hot chocolate?

152
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,610
It was something my mommy loved.

153
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,019
Auntie Ha Na
made it for me last time,

154
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,019
and it was really good.

155
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,620
My mommy and Auntie Ha Na...

156
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,159
- Eun Chong.
- Uncle Ji Chang!

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,299
Goodbye, sir.

158
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,629
All right. Goodbye.

159
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,919
- Who's that old man?
- Santa...

160
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,950
He's Grandpa Beard.

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,649
He doesn't even have
a lot of facial hair.

162
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,659
You need to be careful
of who you talk to.

163
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,929
Do you know how scary this world is?
Don't be so naive.

164
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,029
Give me your foot.

165
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,629
You're all set. Let's go.

166
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,610
Why is there a parcel here
that isn't ours?

167
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,210
I saw it by the door
on my way to work,

168
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,649
so I thought it was yours
and brought it in.

169
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,879
- Isn't it yours?
- It's the place across the hall.

170
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,580
They'll come for it, I guess.

171
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,720
Okay. Bye.

172
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,500
I heard my parcel was
delivered to your place.

173
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:28,830
Come in.

174
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:32,440
- Just give me the parcel.
- Come in and take it.

175
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,909
If you agree, cheers.

176
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,879
Cheers.

177
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,649
Cheers.

178
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,490
- Goodness.
- I'll get it.

179
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,149
You knew it wasn't delivered to you,
so why did you bring it in?

180
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,389
You wanted me to come for it,
didn't you?

181
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,159
You said you didn't care.

182
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,419
You called me plain water.

183
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,029
That was why you didn't care
to get revenge.

184
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:32,259
Did you want
to make that woman feel excited?

185
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,730
It's a prank.

186
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,539
I'm having fun toying with you.

187
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,610
You pretend to be strong
in front of me,

188
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,440
but you react, tense up,
and get excited...

189
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,610
with everything I say
and every touch I make.

190
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,580
I also want to see...

191
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:56,450
how the castle you built with lies,
ambitions, and obsessions...

192
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,990
will come crashing down.

193
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,490
I'll never crash down.

194
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,200
I'll rise even higher,
away from your sight.

195
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,629
Even higher?

196
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,330
Did Chairwoman Shin's daughter die?

197
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:11,639
She can return any minute now.

198
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,940
Yes, that's your real face.

199
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,840
I'll welcome her if she returns.

200
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,149
I'm honestly
waiting for her to come.

201
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,419
I need you
to mind your own business.

202
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,649
You always say you don't care,
but who'll believe you?

203
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,429
Everything you do screams
that you care.

204
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,559
Good luck with your pranks.

205
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,639
Is this one of your pranks?

206
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,279
You fool.

207
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,259
Mr. Hwang, I will become...

208
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,929
a proud tour guide and operator.

209
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,629
That way, when life is
hard and tiring for my family,

210
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,529
I can be
a trustworthy breadwinner...

211
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:52,139
to help them rest
with peace of mind.

212
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,039
Is your family all you care about?

213
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,710
You come first, then your family.

214
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,610
Can you
separate yourself completely...

215
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,049
from your family?

216
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,350
My situation isn't like yours.

217
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,120
My family sacrificed for me.
Well, even now.

218
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,519
Parents would do anything
for their children.

219
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,000
His heart would break
if he found out his mother was...

220
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,830
working as the chairwoman's maid.

221
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,539
I didn't think even parents should
sacrifice so much for their kids.

222
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,470
You should look after yourself
while you care for your family.

223
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,110
You have to be fully charged
to help out your family.

224
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,210
My family is what charges my energy.

225
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,409
When I'm with my siblings
and Eun Chong,

226
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,120
I feel full at heart,

227
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:42,490
even though we're broke
and don't own a home.

228
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,990
When I was younger,
I always felt empty here,

229
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,730
like the wind blew
through a hole here.

230
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,529
"Wind blowing through a hole?"

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,129
I thought you must've been
dearly loved as a child.

232
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,570
Did I seem like that?

233
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,600
Yes, I can tell
just by how you treat Eun Chong.

234
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,980
You could give him that much love
because you were loved like that.

235
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,809
You're right.

236
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,179
I was deeply loved.

237
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,419
You know you and Mr. Goo seem
completely different,

238
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,750
although you two are
siblings by blood, right?

239
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,259
We aren't siblings by blood.

240
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,860
I was adopted.

241
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:27,429
Ji Seok's parents were
good friends with my dad,

242
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,039
so they raised me
like I was their own.

243
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,240
I realized it was
reassuring to have family...

244
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,149
only after I met my foster parents.

245
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,419
And what it was like to be loved.

246
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,059
That hole in your heart was filled.

247
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,230
Yes, completely.

248
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,639
- You should have some meat, too.
- Okay.

249
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,940
You must've been through a lot.

250
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,110
I'd be lying if I said no.

251
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,519
Gosh, I'm the only one
who's devouring the food.

252
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,950
You should eat to your fill
while you have a chance.

253
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:25,360
How do you vent...

254
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,389
when you're mad,
stressed out, and annoyed?

255
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,059
Well, I have my secret.

256
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,429
- Soju and beer?
- It's not here.

257
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,200
Do you want to come with me
if you really want to know?

258
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,320
All right!

259
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,950
This is awesome!

260
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,019
Mr. Hwang, come and join me.

261
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,490
I can feel my stress melting
just by watching.

262
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,730
Hooray!

263
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,769
It's the best way
to relieve your stress.

264
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:18,339
I feel light as a feather
both in my body and mind after this.

265
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,680
It feels like my body is
rising up and up.

266
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,720
Don't you want to know how it feels?

267
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,750
You don't feel like you're flying
but rising up?

268
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,390
Like a rocket?

269
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,990
"A rocket."

270
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,559
- One moment, please.
- Sure.

271
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,599
Hey, Se Young.

272
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:41,369
Are you home?

273
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,470
No, I'm on my way. Where are you?

274
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,910
I'm at our place. Come here.

275
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,670
Your family is home,
so it's too late to be there.

276
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,240
I mean our newlywed home.

277
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,579
- Have you been drinking?
- Yes.

278
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,049
I'll drink until you come,

279
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,319
so be here quickly
if you don't want me to get drunk.

280
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,390
Drink slowly.

281
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,789
It'll take about 30 minutes
if I head there now.

282
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,289
Bye.

283
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,460
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

284
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,130
Hey, it's raining!

285
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,569
My goodness.

286
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,509
Run.

287
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,730
I can run to my car,

288
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,529
so please take this.

289
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:53,759
No, it's okay, Mr. Hwang.

290
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,599
Listen to me.

291
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,269
You might catch a cold.

292
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,769
Go home safely.

293
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,920
It smells like...

294
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,250
- pork belly!
- Pork belly!

295
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,589
And it was grilled
over hot charcoal.

296
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,059
Wait, he must be loaded.

297
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,660
Do you think
Auntie Ha Na has a boyfriend?

298
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,869
Why? Do you want her
to marry him soon and adopt you?

299
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,940
I know it's not that easy.

300
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,269
You little...

301
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,269
What are you up to?

302
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,380
Why were you in the shower
for so long?

303
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,609
Ha Na, do you have a boyfriend?

304
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:46,279
Stop overreacting. Nothing happened.

305
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,049
Then, whose coat is this?

306
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,559
You couldn't have picked it up
off the street.

307
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,420
If he's anything like Lee Seok Ki,
I'll nip him in the bud...

308
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,059
Go watch your drama.

309
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,829
Today, they're going to find out
that the daughter is dead.

310
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,029
Yes, you're right.

311
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,380
I must be crazy.

312
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,319
You're here.

313
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,089
- What are all those shoes?
- I'm throwing them out.

314
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,690
They look perfectly fine.

315
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,259
I got sick of them.

316
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,799
It's a shame to throw out
perfectly good shoes.

317
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,730
I don't wear them anyway.

318
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,970
Our wedding photo is here.

319
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,079
- It looks great.
- Doesn't it?

320
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,349
But it was misdelivered
to Mr. Goo's place.

321
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,890
- And he's right next door.
- "Right next door?"

322
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,259
I hoped it wouldn't be true,
but it was.

323
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,730
Don't let him stress you out.

324
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,430
We won't live here forever.

325
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,230
Of course not.

326
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,799
He was a nobody who rolled in,

327
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,599
so he'd roll away to another place.

328
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,670
But don't make
your hostility too obvious.

329
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,039
There's quite a tension
between you and him.

330
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,940
I can never hide my feelings.

331
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,410
Why were you dressed so lightly?
Where's your coat?

332
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:24,609
What?

333
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,289
It got wet, so I left it in the car.

334
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:29,690
What if you catch a cold?

335
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,660
Do you want a drink?

336
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,490
The doctor said you were allowed
to have some wine occasionally.

337
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,529
Sure.

338
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,160
Kongkong, where are you?

339
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,039
Where are you?

340
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,539
What's wrong, Eun Chong?

341
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,509
I can't find Kongkong, Auntie.

342
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:56,210
What? Let's find him together.

343
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,319
Where are you, Kongkong?

344
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,750
- Kongkong.
- Eun Chong.

345
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,420
When did you last see him?

346
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,690
What's with the loud noise?

347
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,430
I can't focus on the drama.

348
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,490
We need to find Kongkong.

349
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,930
Uncle Ji Chang, Kongkong is gone.

350
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,069
Right!
He said he hated you and left.

351
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,809
Why did you make him cry?

352
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,980
Uncle Ji Chang is lying.

353
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,210
Kongkong is at home.

354
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,640
Start looking.

355
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,349
You always act like a grownup,

356
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,680
but you choose to be a baby now?

357
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,279
Just go to sleep.

358
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,250
Start looking right now.

359
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,759
That darned Kongkong.

360
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,559
Kongkong will see this
and tease you for crying.

361
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,529
I don't think he's in the room,

362
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,599
so let's look for him
in the living room and the kitchen.

363
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,900
Okay.

364
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,440
- Eureka!
- Oh.

365
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,410
Where is he?

366
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,049
Did you take a nap today or not?

367
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,319
I did.

368
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,119
Kongkong!

369
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,490
Auntie, I found him!

370
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,559
Gosh, the separated families
were reunited.

371
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,259
He'll start school soon.
Will you keep letting him do this?

372
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,069
A boy like him shouldn't be attached
to a doll like that.

373
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,529
Speak for yourself.

374
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,539
You were worse than him at his age.
But you were attached to me.

375
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,309
That's not my fault.

376
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:29,940
It's your fault
for raising me like that.

377
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,980
Uncle Ji Chang, it still seems like
you're attached to her.

378
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,380
Yes, I'm attached to Ha Na.
What will you do?

379
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:40,420
Then, I'll take Ha Na tonight.
You can keep Kongkong.

380
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,190
Both Kongkong
and Auntie Ha Na are mine.

381
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,029
My gosh. All right.
Have as much fun as you want.

382
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,630
- Just put me back where I belong.
- Let go of her. She's my sister.

383
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,400
- Auntie Ha Na is mine!
- She's my sister.

384
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,099
- What are you doing?
- No way!

385
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,269
- You have Kongkong.
- You both need to let go.

386
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,140
Stop it.

387
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,269
- What's with you two?
- Give her back!

388
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,369
- What's with you?
- No, she's my sister!

389
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,380
I need to find my grandson
right now.

390
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,079
I'll do every possible thing I can
to find him.

391
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,710
What if you told her who he was...

392
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,349
and that she shouldn't disclose
he was of Hyesung Group's blood?

393
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:18,490
Something good enough
to console her daughter's death.

394
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,960
My auntie is my mommy!

395
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,160
How many times do I have to say it?
Are you stupid?

396
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,759
No, you're stupid!

397
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,730
How can your auntie
become your mommy?

398
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,200
My auntie will become my mommy!

399
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,500
I'll find my grandma, too!

400
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:53,819
Now, there really is no one
who'll return to this room.

401
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,630
I promised...

402
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,730
I would do whatever it took
to find you.

403
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,130
But I didn't do anything.

404
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,309
I couldn't find you or protect you.

405
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,319
But I will...

406
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,849
find your son.

407
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:28,890
I'll find him...

408
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,259
and protect him.

409
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,119
Were you that scared and sad...

410
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,190
when you didn't see Kongkong?

411
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:06,359
Plushies are good
for babies' emotional development.

412
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,500
Do babies really think
that's their mother?

413
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,369
Yes, I hear this plushie...

414
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,569
and their parents are everything
to the babies.

415
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,509
Everything.

416
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,680
- Then, it must have a name.
- Of course.

417
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,039
This plushie is named Kongkong.

418
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,549
Kongkong was his baby bump nickname.

419
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,319
The first day you heard
the sound of his heartbeat,

420
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,990
you said your tiny baby
sounded like, "Kong, kong."

421
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,519
You came crying
and gave him that nickname.

422
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,660
You're right.

423
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,630
I hoped Kongkong would be
a wonderful present for him,

424
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,259
just as how he came into my life
like a precious present.

425
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:42,470
There's a magnificent meaning
behind that tiny thing.

426
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,240
Then, let's take a photo
to commemorate his first friend.

427
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,299
Okay.

428
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,180
I think I found my mom's place.

429
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,220
You really found her? Where was it?

430
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,119
I'm not 100 percent sure yet,
but something feels very familiar.

431
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,490
I think I'll know as soon
as I walk into the front yard.

432
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,789
Goodness. Sit here, Eun Chong.

433
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,369
Reverend Mother.

434
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,599
I still can't believe this.

435
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,839
How can this happen to Du Na,
leaving Eun Chong behind?

436
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,450
She must have trouble
going over to the other side,

437
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,819
leaving this little kid behind.

438
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,180
What will happen to him?

439
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,359
Reverend Mother,
I can pick up more part-time jobs...

440
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,660
Ha Na, he'll grow up safely with us.

441
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,829
Your siblings are against this idea,

442
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:24,769
and you have to work, too.
How will you take him?

443
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
It's not time yet.

444
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,240
Just as we had discussed,
you can take him...

445
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,410
if you feel the same way
after a few years.

446
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,250
When that day comes,
I won't stop you.

447
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,779
Okay.

448
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,589
If you're done cleaning her things,
you can give them to me.

449
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:50,130
You should go back now.

450
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,200
Okay.

451
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,400
Come here, Eun Chong.

452
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,740
I'll come by often to see you.

453
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,069
Stay healthy.

454
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,309
You should go
before he starts crying.

455
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,910
Okay.

456
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,619
This plushie and their parents
are everything to the babies.

457
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,900
Eun Chong, you're coming with me.

458
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,500
I'll do whatever it takes
to be with you.

459
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,670
I'll find your grandmother
on behalf of your mommy.

460
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:41,339
I'll make Kongkong for you, too.

461
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,779
Yu Jin.

462
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,410
Yu Jin.

463
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,740
(Messages)

464
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:42,470
He's...

465
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,650
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

466
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,519
Thank you.

467
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,359
Hello. My name is Lee Eun Chong
of Chamsae Class...

468
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,130
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

469
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,559
Why is his photo...

470
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,200
(Cinderella Game)

471
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,740
Why that children's home?

472
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,170
Did you ask
where he went with your aunt?

473
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,710
You should be careful.

474
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,240
You're a bad liar.

475
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,549
Is he really Yu Jin's son?

476
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,920
Does President Hwang
have a girlfriend?

477
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,220
Anyone can tell you're flirting
with the president as a woman.

478
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,589
It's too dangerous
to put a tail on her.

479
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:06,720
My only chance is that safe.

480
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,589
I must keep Eun Chong safe.

481
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,059
I'll go to Ms. Goo Ha Na's place.
