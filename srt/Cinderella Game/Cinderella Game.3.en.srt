1
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,488
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,959
I should've paid more attention.

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,028
I'm okay.

4
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:12,499
When you get tired, you can just say so.

5
00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:14,769
No one will blame you for saying that.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:17,938
Goodness, kiddo.

7
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,738
You made such a huge first impression.

8
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:27,518
Ha Na.

9
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:33,889
Can you show your new friend around the children's home?

10
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:35,819
- Sure. - Thank you.

11
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,989
Reverent Mother, you have a guest.

12
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:40,298
All right.

13
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:45,929
Hi, my name is Lee Ha Na.

14
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,639
What's your name?

15
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:50,268
I don't know.

16
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,239
Don't you have a name?

17
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,349
Do you want to check out my hideout first?

18
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,159
Gosh, it's so cool.

19
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,028
This is your hideout?

20
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,698
Yes.

21
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:18,969
No one knows about it.

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,138
Well, they don't come here even if they know.

23
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,668
They don't know how cool it looks.

24
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,409
You're cool.

25
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,379
- Me? - Yes.

26
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,489
It's really cool that you know a place like this.

27
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:38,918
Don't mention it.

28
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:40,918
It feels like the wind blows to comfort me...

29
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:43,258
when I feel troubled at heart.

30
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:47,799
It feels like the wind is patting my heart slowly.

31
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:52,398
That's how a mom's hand must feel.

32
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,599
"Mom's hand?"

33
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,269
I read in books and watched on TV...

34
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,379
that a mom's hand feels warm, cozy,

35
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:02,409
and gentle on you.

36
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:06,819
What else is good about this place?

37
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:09,849
When you sit here,

38
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:12,589
you can be the first to see...

39
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,219
who's coming and going.

40
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,728
And who's coming for us, too.

41
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,659
So, when I sit here,

42
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,928
I don't feel alone even when I am.

43
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:27,939
Hey! That's where we took a break, right?

44
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:30,168
- Right? - Yes.

45
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,539
Ha Na.

46
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:41,619
She came after her previous adoption was terminated,

47
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,349
so it wouldn't be easy to bring it up to her.

48
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,789
She has been abused,

49
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,018
so she could feel wary of people.

50
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,089
We should've looked for her a little earlier.

51
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:54,059
I'll wait until Ha Na opens up.

52
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:55,798
Come in.

53
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:58,928
- Reverend Mother, Ha Na is here. - Yes.

54
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:04,268
Hey. You should meet them.

55
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,678
These are your dad's friends, Ha Na.

56
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,809
- My dad's friends? - Yes.

57
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,319
Hello.

58
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,178
You look just like your dad.

59
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:19,119
Yes, I see her resemblance to Su Hwan.

60
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,858
Everything burned down when she was seven years old,

61
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:28,499
so she had nothing on her file when she came.

62
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,268
She doesn't know what her father looks like.

63
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,069
I probably have photos of your dad.

64
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:37,208
But they are all from our childhood.

65
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,309
But I still want to see Dad's pictures.

66
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,379
You should visit us sometime. We'll show you.

67
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,789
This is a present to remember our first meeting.

68
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:53,758
- "A present?" - Yes.

69
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:06,029
This is where you two will stay.

70
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:10,009
If she doesn't know something, you can tell her, Ha Na.

71
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:11,438
Okay.

72
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,308
Right, she doesn't know her name.

73
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:17,509
Yes, we should give you a name.

74
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,678
Is there a name you want to go by?

75
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,589
You're close to Ha Na, so how does Du Na sound?

76
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,789
- "Du Na?" - Du Na.

77
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,159
Hey, Ha Na.

78
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,829
So, what's her last name?

79
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,099
Why don't you be a Lee, just like Ha Na?

80
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,368
Lee Du Na.

81
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:43,938
You can live as Lee Du Na...

82
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,139
until your memories come back.

83
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,248
Lee Ha Na and Lee Du Na,

84
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,519
you two must get along like real sisters.

85
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:54,818
- "Sisters?" - "Sisters?"

86
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,048
Yes.

87
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,389
Then, I'll see you at dinner.

88
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,519
- Yes. - Yes.

89
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,259
- You really don't remember a thing? - No.

90
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,759
What's this?

91
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,899
My dad's friend gave it to me.

92
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,909
- How does it look? - It's pretty.

93
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,358
At this rate, I may end up losing Se Young, too.

94
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:39,389
No.

95
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,498
- It wasn't my fault. - Se Young.

96
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,969
No. Stop it.

97
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:48,139
Go away. Don't come!

98
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,238
What's wrong?

99
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:53,378
Did you have a nightmare?

100
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,009
Mommy, what about Yu Jin?

101
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:00,079
Did you dream about Yu Jin?

102
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:02,978
Yu Jin came home and told the truth.

103
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,418
She said it was my fault.

104
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,358
It was just a dream.

105
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,488
Nothing happened.

106
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,228
She said it was all my fault.

107
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,829
She said everything happened because I hated her.

108
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:20,568
What if she comes back and says everything is my fault?

109
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,269
It wasn't your fault.

110
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,469
I told you to believe me.

111
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:30,349
You were in the restroom.

112
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:32,678
Yu Jin got on the boat alone during that time.

113
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,079
You didn't see anything.

114
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:35,649
And...

115
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:40,159
Yu Jin won't come back.

116
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,389
- Really? - Believe me.

117
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,259
I'm scared.

118
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,829
It's okay.

119
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,798
Nothing will happen.

120
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:59,068
You have me. You have nothing to worry about.

121
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,519
It's a bug! What am I going to do?

122
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:11,048
Wait a moment.

123
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,128
I got it!

124
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,928
You're really brave.

125
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:25,769
- Me? - Yes.

126
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,438
You're cool.

127
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:33,709
It's wriggling.

128
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,039
What should we do?

129
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,849
Let's tell the reverend mother that we'll keep this.

130
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,878
You want to keep this?

131
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,719
It's a tiny caterpillar right now,

132
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,589
but it'll be beautiful once it becomes a butterfly.

133
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,589
This bug will turn into a butterfly?

134
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,159
Yes, don't you want to see it?

135
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,899
I do.

136
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,298
Then, let's name it, too.

137
00:07:58,568 --> 00:07:59,668
Okay.

138
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,368
You're Ha Na, and I'm Du Na, so...

139
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:04,938
- Se Na? - Se Na?

140
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,849
Then, you've ceased the ocean search?

141
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:12,978
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:14,748
Please continue!

143
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:17,418
How are all these people unable to find just one child?

144
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:18,889
A long time has passed.

145
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:20,858
In most cases,

146
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,458
the missing person wouldn't have made it.

147
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,029
I'm sorry, Mr. Yoon.

148
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,359
(The police for the people, staying true to the basics.)

149
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:32,769
What are you talking about?

150
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:34,938
How would you know if my daughter's dead?

151
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,338
Which newspaper are you with?

152
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,938
Do not dare to publish a single line like that.

153
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:41,379
I'll end your career.

154
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:51,848
Sung Ho.

155
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:56,859
Where's Yu Jin?

156
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,359
What about her? Why are you back home alone?

157
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,239
Sung Ho!

158
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,649
What's wrong?

159
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:20,578
Why are you here alone?

160
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,149
I wrapped up everything.

161
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,389
"Wrapped up?" Wrap up what?

162
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,389
Did you just say...

163
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,859
you gave up on looking for her?

164
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,058
There's no hope.

165
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:34,499
What do you mean there's no hope?

166
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,328
They haven't searched long enough to say that.

167
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:38,999
And you just agreed and came home?

168
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:42,639
How could you leave her there and turn around?

169
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,168
How do you call yourself her dad?

170
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:49,678
Tell them to resume the search.

171
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,249
Tell them to find Yu Jin.

172
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,678
Don't give up, Sung Ho.

173
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,818
You're her dad. You can't give up on her.

174
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,818
You just can't!

175
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,088
Tell them to resume the search.

176
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,159
Tell them to do it again.

177
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:09,159
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,399
It's all your fault.

179
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,308
I tried so hard to stop you from going.

180
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,879
We wouldn't have lost her if you had listened to me.

181
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:25,649
We lost her because you insisted on going.

182
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:30,548
Bring my daughter back.

183
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,159
Bring my daughter back! Yu Jin...

184
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:40,899
Yu Jin...

185
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:05,418
How can you drink right now?

186
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:10,218
I won't forgive you unless you bring Yu Jin home.

187
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,389
I'll curse you for the rest of your life.

188
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,678
Sung Ho!

189
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:37,818
Let go of me!

190
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:41,019
I can picture that poor girl trembling all alone.

191
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:43,558
Please calm down, Yeo Jin.

192
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,458
Even if you go there now, Sung Ho...

193
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,899
He's no longer Yu Jin's dad.

194
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,229
She's now my daughter. I'm going.

195
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:52,499
I'll go and find her.

196
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,999
- Goodness, no. - Let go of me.

197
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:58,539
You won't be able to see her even if you go there.

198
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,239
Shut up.

199
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:03,338
You have no right to say that.

200
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:04,379
She's my daughter.

201
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,678
If she was alive, she'd come back to us.

202
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:09,279
She'll come to us even if you don't go there.

203
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,318
What is this utter nonsense?

204
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:14,359
You should want to find that young girl...

205
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,718
who's out there doing who knows what.

206
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:17,958
You want to wait until she comes home?

207
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:22,328
Do you expect me to wait for 10 or 20 years until I grow old?

208
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:29,269
There's nothing you can do even if you go there.

209
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,308
How do you know if there's nothing I can do?

210
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,068
You gave up before trying.

211
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,879
I can't sit around and wait like you're doing.

212
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,048
So what if you can't wait?

213
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,048
Waiting is the only thing we can do at this point.

214
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,019
Do you want to cry and wail?

215
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,918
Do you want to beg and plead?

216
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:50,318
Do you want to do nothing but stare at the sea?

217
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:52,958
Then grow exhausted in prayer?

218
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:56,198
Do you want to do that?

219
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:00,298
If so, go ahead.

220
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:18,218
This is all your fault! It's your fault!

221
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:24,688
Yu Jin...

222
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,598
Goodness, Yeo Jin.

223
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,468
You'll end up ill, too.

224
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,499
Yu Jin...

225
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,708
Yu Jin...

226
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,448
No, my poor Yu Jin...

227
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,818
Why didn't you say you were asleep at the beach?

228
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,958
I thought they'd think I was a thief.

229
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,889
Then, police officers would come and arrest me.

230
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:01,899
I'm not a thief.

231
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,529
So, it's a secret.

232
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:06,598
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

233
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,808
I saw in a drama that a character who lost their memories...

234
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:15,979
got them back after bumping their head hard on the wall.

235
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,409
- Really? - Yes.

236
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:26,789
Like this.

237
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:30,629
You should try, too.

238
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,458
Do it harder.

239
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,999
Your head needs that impact...

240
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,129
to make the cells come alive and bring the memories back.

241
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,369
Ouch.

242
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,568
I'll practice every single day starting tomorrow.

243
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:52,979
Goodnight, Du Na.

244
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,749
Goodnight, Ha Na.

245
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,729
- Over here. - Hello.

246
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:07,529
Hello, have you seen this girl?

247
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,759
I don't think so.

248
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,058
Can you take another look?

249
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,529
And this is my phone number.

250
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,639
Hello, please take a look at this.

251
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,568
Have you seen her? She's about this tall.

252
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:21,078
No.

253
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:23,109
(Missing Child, Name: Yoon Yu Jin, 10 years old, girl)

254
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:25,279
(Height: 135cm, fair-skinned, round face, big eyes,)

255
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,479
(white dress, pink vest, clear speech)

256
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,318
(Missing Child, Name: Yoon Yu Jin)

257
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,448
Have you seen this girl around here?

258
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,588
No, I haven't.

259
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,889
Could you keep this and take a closer look?

260
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:47,938
(Missing Child, Name: Yoon Yu Jin)

261
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:53,539
(Missing Child, Name: Yoon Yu Jin)

262
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:59,649
(Missing Child, Name: Yoon Yu Jin)

263
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,178
Hide well

264
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,818
I can still see your hair

265
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:07,489
Hide well

266
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:10,058
I can still see your hair

267
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:12,029
Brothers and sisters,

268
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,859
have another great week.

269
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,999
May the Almighty's grace always keep you happy...

270
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:21,438
and healthy.

271
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:25,109
Don't you love this fall weather?

272
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,808
I will always pray...

273
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,779
for the good of your life as a priest.

274
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,779
Let us recite The Disciples' Prayer.

275
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,649
Father in the heavens,

276
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:43,218
you have allowed us here today...

277
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,229
Did you come here alone?

278
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,668
No, I came with my dad.

279
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,598
- Do you live around here? - No.

280
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:56,199
In this children's home,

281
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,709
- my dad's friend's... - Ouch.

282
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,239
Are you okay?

283
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:04,808
All done.

284
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,719
I sewed it on tightly. It won't come off again.

285
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,189
Where did you learn to do this?

286
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:15,588
- I picked it up. - What?

287
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:20,158
Hide well

288
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:22,699
I can still see your hair

289
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:24,999
I found you.

290
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:30,439
What? I thought I heard someone.

291
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,328
My gosh.

292
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:59,029
I saw spring, summer, fall, and winter from this place.

293
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,739
Which season was the best?

294
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:03,739
All of them.

295
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,368
Aren't you scared?

296
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,439
"Scared?" It looks so awesome.

297
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:13,808
Look.

298
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,388
Ha Na, Ji Seok.

299
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:23,219
- Sir. - Dad.

300
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:26,658
You two were here together.

301
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:28,628
You two should meet.

302
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:30,999
She's Ha Na, the older girl I mentioned.

303
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,499
He's my son, Ji Seok.

304
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,669
Hi, my name is Lee Ha Na.

305
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,308
Hi, my name is Goo Ji Seok.

306
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:53,949
I'm sorry, Yu Jin.

307
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,858
Daddy is so sorry.

308
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:01,558
Just die instead.

309
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:04,128
If you're going to drink the problem away, just die.

310
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:07,638
Yu Jin won't come back if you sit here and drink.

311
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:09,368
Drinking was the last thing I could do.

312
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,039
I feel too stifled to go on.

313
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,279
Do you want to go on?

314
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,848
How can you want to go on after losing your child?

315
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:22,749
If my death will bring Yu Jin back,

316
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,848
I can die right here.

317
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,348
Please...

318
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,189
If your death can...

319
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,029
bring Yu Jin back,

320
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:40,368
then please...

321
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,739
die.

322
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,138
I wouldn't have lost her...

323
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:50,108
if you came with us.

324
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:55,148
She begged you so much to come along.

325
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,519
You turned her down for work.

326
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:03,719
Are you...

327
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,789
blaming me right now?

328
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:13,969
Your priority isn't Yu Jin...

329
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:15,868
or our family.

330
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:19,338
It was always...

331
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,408
your business...

332
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,378
and money.

333
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,408
Your shoulders are really hard for a woman.

334
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:55,739
You should cut down on work...

335
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:58,648
and spend more time with Yu Jin, too.

336
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,618
As soon as I'm done with this project.

337
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:03,449
Don't just say it.

338
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:07,019
Yu Jin wants to go to an amusement park...

339
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:08,719
and a swimming pool with you.

340
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,689
Mommy, Daddy.

341
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:16,398
- What's that? - Water for the night.

342
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:19,898
- "Water for the night?" - I just watched a cartoon,

343
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:21,969
and it said good daughters brought water for the night...

344
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,169
to their parents in the past.

345
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:26,169
So, Yu Jin, the good daughter,

346
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:28,608
brought water for Mommy and Daddy?

347
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:33,048
Yes, I'll bring you and Daddy this for the rest of my life.

348
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,279
Are you not going to marry and live with us forever?

349
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:39,318
Yes, I want to live with you and Mommy forever.

350
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:42,618
- Gosh, is that so? - Daddy, stop!

351
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:46,358
My gosh.

352
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,868
He lost Yu Jin right before his eyes.

353
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:01,709
It must be hard on him.

354
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:05,808
He blames himself and drinks every single day.

355
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:09,818
What if he considers the worst choice he can make?

356
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:11,449
I've been feeling anxious.

357
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:14,259
Please get my clothes.

358
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:16,959
Are you going somewhere?

359
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:19,959
I need to go to work.

360
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:22,658
Will you be all right?

361
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,398
I should be.

362
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,368
I had private divers investigate the area,

363
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:30,598
but she never showed up.

364
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:32,868
She's not in the sea.

365
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:34,979
She must be alive on land somewhere.

366
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:40,009
I'll look everywhere people can go to and find her.

367
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:49,719
I'm not going to school.

368
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:53,858
My friends keep asking me why Yu Jin won't come to school.

369
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,858
I told you to ignore them whenever they asked you.

370
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:03,638
All right. I'll have another talk with your teacher.

371
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:05,908
I want to go to a new school...

372
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:08,039
where no one knows her.

373
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:13,009
All right. You can transfer.

374
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:14,679
This is hard on me, too.

375
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,949
Are you sure she won't come back?

376
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,449
How can she?

377
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:24,959
So, when you go to your aunt's place,

378
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,699
be a big girl and comfort your aunt and uncle.

379
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:33,368
From now on, you need to do Yu Jin's part, too.

380
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,169
No, I'm scared.

381
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,638
Without her,

382
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:40,509
you can become her.

383
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,739
How can I become her?

384
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,878
Does your aunt have any other children?

385
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:49,179
Then, who's her closest relative?

386
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:51,749
You.

387
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,318
What will she do with all her fortune...

388
00:23:57,318 --> 00:24:00,088
in the bank and the business she does?

389
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:01,929
She wouldn't pass it on to a stranger.

390
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:06,898
Everything will be yours if you behave well.

391
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:10,769
I'll make it happen.

392
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:15,179
Will I really get everything that belongs to Yu Jin?

393
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,048
Only if you do as I say.

394
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:23,479
Ha Na.

395
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:27,818
Se Na is gone.

396
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,088
What?

397
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:32,858
I came to feed it, but it was gone.

398
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,358
I can't see it.

399
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,199
You're right. Where did it go?

400
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:42,239
I must've left it open for too long while I cleaned it up yesterday.

401
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:43,539
What are we going to do?

402
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:46,739
I wanted to see it turn into a butterfly.

403
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:49,209
Did it become one already and fly away?

404
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:51,679
Girls.

405
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,679
What's wrong? Is something going on?

406
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,419
Reverend Mother, Se Na is gone.

407
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,019
What happened?

408
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:08,828
Se Na is here.

409
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,128
- Where? - Where?

410
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:11,628
Right here.

411
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,699
Se Na turned into a pupa.

412
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,499
- A pupa? - A pupa?

413
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,769
Well, for a caterpillar to turn into a butterfly,

414
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,509
it has to spend time as a pupa.

415
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:25,848
It goes into that cocoon and makes its wings.

416
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:33,088
Reverend Mother, then do people also go through a pupa period?

417
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:36,989
Of course, everyone experiences such a period.

418
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:39,729
You'll experience lonely, sad,

419
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:41,628
and tough things in life,

420
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:44,769
but you two will be so beautiful...

421
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,769
when you turn into butterflies after that.

422
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,499
I'm already looking forward to it.

423
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,368
Then, we need to become pupas before we turn into butterflies.

424
00:25:54,368 --> 00:25:55,739
Gosh, pupas.

425
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:00,949
Girls, let's take a look.

426
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:03,749
Se Na looks very healthy.

427
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,789
(MRI Scan Result)

428
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,388
The result looks excellent, and so does the prognosis.

429
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,259
My gosh.

430
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:20,628
Good management is important after cardiac valve surgery,

431
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,039
so he won't have any problems as long as you manage it well.

432
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,169
Thank you, Doctor.

433
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:32,348
It's all thanks to that lucky bracelet.

434
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,949
You met the chairwoman and got the surgery...

435
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:36,878
ever since you wore that.

436
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:38,689
Do you still have it?

437
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:43,318
Well...

438
00:26:44,888 --> 00:26:46,029
Where is it?

439
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,429
You can have this.

440
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,398
It won't be as good as family,

441
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:55,669
but it'll keep you safe when you're in trouble.

442
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,638
Stay strong.

443
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:01,338
Why did you give it to someone? You should keep it on.

444
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:03,608
Who did you give it to?

445
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:05,979
A friend.

446
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,118
All right.

447
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:13,289
Let me close the door. Come here.

448
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,658
Let me see your hat.

449
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:16,419
It looks great on you.

450
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,959
You can share this with your friends.

451
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:31,169
Du Na, guys, I'm back.

452
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:33,769
I got ice cream for everyone.

453
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:34,878
- Really? - Really?

454
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:38,449
He told me a lot about my dad.

455
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,479
Ji Seok and Ji Eun are really nice, too.

456
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:44,449
And the lady's stomach was already this big.

457
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:45,848
She'll give birth to a baby very soon.

458
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,318
This time, they won't give you up, right?

459
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:49,888
They're your dad's friend.

460
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:53,658
I also want to meet nice mommy and daddy.

461
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:56,529
It'd be harder for us to get adopted if we grew any older, right?

462
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,529
Let's go outside and play.

463
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,638
- Okay. - Let's go.

464
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:12,779
Du Na, why won't you eat the ice cream?

465
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:18,249
I don't think my mommy will come for me.

466
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:21,719
She must've abandoned me with the grandpa and left for good.

467
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:26,529
Then, there's no way her friend will come and adopt me.

468
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:30,398
I'll always be alone.

469
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,398
You aren't alone.

470
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:35,798
There's the reverend mother, me, and other friends.

471
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:38,509
You'll have a new family soon.

472
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:40,308
You're already my family.

473
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:43,209
The reverend mother said we were sisters.

474
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,408
We're very special sisters,

475
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,949
so we'll be connected at heart even when we're apart.

476
00:28:48,078 --> 00:28:51,419
You will continue to be my sister even after you live...

477
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:53,548
with Mr. Goo's family, right?

478
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,219
Of course.

479
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,558
It doesn't matter if we're apart or if anything happens.

480
00:28:58,558 --> 00:28:59,759
We'll always be family.

481
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:03,429
Come to their place with me this Saturday.

482
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:06,429
They both want to meet you.

483
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:07,529
Okay.

484
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,568
Hey, a butterfly.

485
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:15,209
Really?

486
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,689
- Se Na looks so pretty. - Se Na looks so pretty.

487
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:27,489
The caterpillar turned into a butterfly, just as you said.

488
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:31,088
That tiny caterpillar became such a beautiful butterfly.

489
00:29:31,489 --> 00:29:32,588
It's a wonder.

490
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:34,128
Are we going to grow up like this?

491
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:37,898
Do you think we're caterpillars or pupas?

492
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,029
I don't know.

493
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:42,338
Later, let's soar high together like butterflies.

494
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:43,769
Okay.

495
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,969
Se Na must want to fly, too.

496
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,939
- Should we help her fly away? - When?

497
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:27,348
(St. Paul's Home)

498
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:28,749
We'll go, then.

499
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:30,848
Say goodbye, Ha Na.

500
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:33,088
Goodbye.

501
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:34,818
- Goodbye. - Bye, Ha Na.

502
00:30:35,118 --> 00:30:36,259
Bye.

503
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:39,929
Shall we?

504
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,368
(St. Paul's Home)

505
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,979
Let us go back inside.

506
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:11,088
(St. Paul's Home)

507
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:12,989
One moment.

508
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,408
You can have this.

509
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,908
But it's from those two.

510
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,308
Are you sure?

511
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:35,679
It's all right.

512
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:37,749
It looks much better on you.

513
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:43,618
This is a new hat, and you can have it.

514
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:46,529
It's my present.

515
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,598
Can I really have it?

516
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:57,699
I think I've seen this hat before.

517
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:00,939
Who's that girl?

518
00:32:11,318 --> 00:32:13,489
"That girl?" Do you remember something?

519
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,858
(Cinderella Game)

520
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:00,068
You don't have the right to stop searching for my daughter.

521
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,199
You need to find Yu Jin, not anybody else!

522
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:04,338
You can leave the chores up to us.

523
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:07,108
All you have to do is play and do whatever you want.

524
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:08,709
We're emigrating to America soon.

525
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:12,108
They want to adopt you, Du Na.

526
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:14,449
She thought her mother left her at her grandfather's home,

527
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:15,979
so the police took her?

528
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:18,489
Wait, what did I just see?

529
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,749
A girl who looked like Yu Jin...

530
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:22,689
What?
