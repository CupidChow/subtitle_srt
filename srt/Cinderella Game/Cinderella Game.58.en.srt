1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,840
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,209
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,209
No, I don't want to.

5
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,779
Put him down right now!

6
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,080
Hey!

7
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,849
- You.
- Go away. No!

8
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,650
No.

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,019
I'm not putting him down.

10
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,359
Say that you'll marry me.

11
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,460
If you don't,
I'll jump out with Eun Chong.

12
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,429
Auntie Ha Na...

13
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,899
Seok Ki, I understand.

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,870
So, come down. We'll talk later.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,539
- Say that you'll marry me.
- Fine. I will.

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,240
So, put Eun Chong down first. Okay?
Please!

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,109
What are you doing?

18
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,509
Put my grandson down right now!

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,979
"My grandson?"

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,390
She just said he was her grandson
in her own words.

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,299
Come here.

22
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,429
Get down from there.

23
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,299
- Get down.
- Mom. Darn it.

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,739
Jeez.

25
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,709
Are you all right?

26
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,079
You must be in shock.

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,250
Are you all right, Yeo Jin?

28
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:20,079
You must've been so shocked
to call him your grandson.

29
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:23,959
Yes, I didn't realize
how that came out wrong.

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,989
He must be quite shocked.

31
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,299
Yes, I'll help him calm down.

32
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,829
Get out of here now.

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,799
I'm sorry, little one.

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,799
Goodness. You must be in shock.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,840
- Hey, come with me. Now.
- Darn it.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,140
- Why didn't you come a bit later?
- What are you doing? Hey.

37
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,579
Who's that?

38
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:54,790
Come here.

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,959
Let me put him to sleep.

40
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,900
He may be in shock,
so keep an eye on him.

41
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,700
Okay.

42
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,979
Eun Chong,
if your heart races quickly...

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,810
or if anything feels
painful or weird, let me know.

44
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,349
Okay. You can tell me
if your heart races...

45
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,080
or if you're in pain, Auntie.

46
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,219
Okay.

47
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,289
That was shocking for me, too.

48
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,289
But why wouldn't she ask me
if I were all right?

49
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,099
What are you doing?

50
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,099
Put my grandson down right now!

51
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,669
"My grandson?"

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,969
She sounded like a grandmother
who was worried about her grandson.

53
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,280
She'd think it was a mistake...

54
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,110
that I called him
my grandson, right?

55
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,090
- Hey. What brings you here?
- What's with you?

56
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,860
- I almost had her.
- What about your restaurant?

57
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,819
My staff are good at their job.

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,289
I heard about what happened
to Eun Chong yesterday.

59
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,460
Who did something that awful?

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,770
A guy like that should be
locked up behind bars.

61
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:16,629
Hey.

62
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,199
Who do you think you are to say
my son needs to be locked up?

63
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,780
Oh, my. Was your son the culprit?

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,909
He should be at the police station
after what he did. Why is he here?

65
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,550
- Did he come to apologize?
- "Culprit?"

66
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,979
It wasn't like
my son committed a crime!

67
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,219
- Huh?
- Hey, that's enough, you two.

68
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,789
My gosh.

69
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
Why are you here, Bang Ul?

70
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,689
I heard the chairwoman
caught a cold.

71
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:42,360
I came to make porridge for her.

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,560
Gosh.

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,129
- Did that go okay?
- Stop.

74
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,599
Pine nut porridge
should be fine, right?

75
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,500
Yes, that sounds good.

76
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,969
Yeo Jin likes that.

77
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,849
Let's go. Come on.

78
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,349
Goodness, Ms. Chairwoman. I'm here.

79
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,889
I heard you caught a cold,
so I came to make pine nut porridge.

80
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,319
Thank you, Ms. Sim.

81
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,990
- Please excuse me.
- Sure.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,829
She's so low on energy.

83
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,939
Did you know that woman
who was here?

84
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:28,670
How would I know her?

85
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,180
Then, why were you exchanging eyes
and winking at each other?

86
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,750
We didn't wink at each other.
Good grief.

87
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,980
You haven't been here for too long,
so you must be seeing things.

88
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,550
You need an eye checkup.

89
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,050
What's with you? My gosh.

90
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,160
You seem really suspicious!

91
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,959
Aunt Yeo Jin dropped that
he was her grandson in her words.

92
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,060
This would crumble down
even if we didn't do anything.

93
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,829
What did you mean
we didn't do anything?

94
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,870
I put so much effort
into Goo Ha Na's ex and his mom.

95
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,300
- Good work, Mom.
- Jeez.

96
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,610
Anyway, why did she date
a lunatic like that?

97
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,939
Only men like that are
in her league.

98
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,050
Gosh.

99
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,720
Hello? Yes.

100
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,290
It wasn't so bad today.

101
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,860
Make sure
you keep an eye on your son.

102
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,629
It seemed like
he was really into her.

103
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,459
Don't let him ruin everything.

104
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,399
Come in.

105
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,240
Is Eun Chong asleep?

106
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,910
Yes, I'll check on him
when he wakes up.

107
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,779
I'm sorry for causing trouble,
although you aren't feeling well.

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,089
Do you feel all right?

109
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,250
I feel better.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,259
I'm glad.

111
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,000
Did the talk go well
with Seok Ki's mom?

112
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,699
Ms. Jang will settle everything.

113
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,339
How much did she demand?

114
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,800
You don't have to mind it.

115
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,339
I was more worried
Eun Chong almost fell into danger...

116
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,610
because of you.

117
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,480
I heard that man took Eun Chong
because he wanted to see you.

118
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,089
Eun Chong also liked him,
so he must've gone without suspicion.

119
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,519
It won't happen again.

120
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:24,660
You never know.

121
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,160
He just took him as a hostage
and threatened you.

122
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,230
He wanted to marry you,

123
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,800
and his mother
wanted the same thing.

124
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,500
I don't.
And they don't mean it, either.

125
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,639
They figured out I was your daughter
and showed up here.

126
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,240
He used Eun Chong as an excuse
to call off our engagement.

127
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,209
That wouldn't have changed.

128
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,350
You broke off your marriage...

129
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,910
- because of Eun Chong?
- Yes.

130
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,279
I was an orphan, poor,

131
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,949
and didn't receive enough education.

132
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,220
There must've been many reasons,

133
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,920
but he blamed it on Eun Chong
like a coward.

134
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,259
Why did you date a guy like him?

135
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,199
How can he threaten you
by using a child?

136
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,110
Hello. When did you get here?

137
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,709
Just now.

138
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,980
You must've been shocked yesterday.
Are you all right?

139
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,410
Yes.

140
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,680
My goodness.

141
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,449
I could see how troubled you were.

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,149
My heart also raced
when I heard everything.

143
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:31,220
It must've been so shocking
to lose him right in front of you.

144
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,490
Thank you for saying that.

145
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,660
Anyway, did that culprit
and his mother...

146
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,529
come here to apologize?

147
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,670
They seemed too arrogant
for someone who came to apologize.

148
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm not sure.

149
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,040
Mother.

150
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,439
What brings you here without a call?

151
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,110
I had to leave without saying goodbye
to the chairwoman,

152
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,519
and I heard she was feeling unwell,

153
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,649
so I wanted to make
some porridge for her, too.

154
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
Why didn't you come with Jin Goo?

155
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,050
He's working.

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,860
Excuse me.

157
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,860
How's your business?

158
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,879
I was more worried Eun Chong almost fell
into danger because of you.

159
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,410
It was true that
he fell into danger because of me.

160
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,279
Lee Seok Ki, that jerk.

161
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,250
How did he know I was here?

162
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,190
And who told him
I was the daughter here?

163
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,659
The home visit got canceled again
because of him.

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,769
Someone made a false report
to stop you from adopting him.

165
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:52,840
The mistake with the address was
just an excuse to cover it up.

166
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,740
It seemed odd
how this was called off twice.

167
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,580
And this time, it was a secret.
How did someone find out?

168
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,490
By any chance,

169
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,960
did you know
about the home visit yesterday?

170
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,389
What are you talking about?

171
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,029
It didn't seem like a coincidence
that the visit was...

172
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:20,929
called off yesterday.

173
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,240
Then, what? Are you blaming me
for Eun Chong's disappearance?

174
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,539
Your pathetic ex-boyfriend took him.

175
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:29,110
How did he find out...

176
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,210
Eun Chong was at a hospital
on the day of the home visit?

177
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,779
Only our family knew
he was at the hospital.

178
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,419
Are you saying I'm in league
with that pathetic man?

179
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,190
You really have a knack
for writing up scenarios.

180
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:44,659
You should get a new job.

181
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,360
You don't sound like
a decent detective,

182
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,690
but your stories are
absurd and forced.

183
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,899
I didn't think you'd be honest.

184
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,730
I'll investigate and find out.

185
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:56,929
Hey, you need to apologize
for getting suspicious of me.

186
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,269
Are you just running off?

187
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,840
If I apologize to you now,

188
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,210
will you kneel down and apologize...

189
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,509
once I find evidence
that you're behind this?

190
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:04,639
Why would I?

191
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,740
Even if I did that,

192
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,549
I'd never apologize to you.

193
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,679
- What?
- I'll never have to kneel...

194
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,220
before someone petty like you.

195
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,820
Never.

196
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,649
You cried and apologized
when Mom was around,

197
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,019
saying you'd get along with me.

198
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,789
- If Mom finds out...
- Oh, my. Will she get rid of me?

199
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,389
My gosh.

200
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:26,159
I'm so scared! What will I do?

201
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,940
What makes her so confident?

202
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,240
She may not want to accept
that I'm Yoon Yu Jin,

203
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,080
but how can she do that
even when Mom is around?

204
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,549
What do you think love is?

205
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,049
Someone I can plan a future with.

206
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,519
Aiming for the same goal.

207
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,330
Are Se Young and I
looking at the same goal?

208
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,600
What's there between us...

209
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,700
other than Hyesung Group?

210
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,470
You called him your grandson?

211
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,539
How did Ha Na and Ms. Choi respond?

212
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,580
I said it came out wrong out of shock,
and they weren't suspicious.

213
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,779
When you write up the settlement,

214
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,620
add a clause restricting him
from approaching Eun Chong...

215
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,419
- so he'll never do that again.
- Yes, ma'am.

216
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,259
You should distance yourself more
from Eun Chong from now on.

217
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:30,799
It's not easy to control myself.

218
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,529
I was reminded of Yu Jin...

219
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,169
when he fell into danger
and lost my mind.

220
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,539
This time,
it was someone Eun Chong knew.

221
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,870
An acquaintance could be
even more dangerous.

222
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,210
What happened yesterday and today
was done by Ha Na's ex-boyfriend.

223
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,580
He could take a worse turn.

224
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,320
That's why
I want to adopt Eun Chong myself.

225
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,289
That's too dangerous.

226
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,419
- If he's known as your grandson...
- I'll make sure no one knows.

227
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,559
Stall for time
with Ha Na's adoption,

228
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,860
postpone the process,
and have me evaluated as his guardian.

229
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,159
Also, find a tutor for him...

230
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,830
until he starts school.

231
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,700
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:18,679
I want to go to the kindergarten!

233
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,149
Eun Chong,
your new teacher will come home.

234
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,750
No, the kindergarten!

235
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,620
He wants to go this badly,
so I'll let him go.

236
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,789
He'll graduate soon,

237
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:33,590
- and he has friends...
- What if someone takes him again?

238
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,090
He gets dropped off and picked up
by a car, so he'll be fine.

239
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,299
I want to go to the kindergarten!

240
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,870
Goodness, Eun Chong.
Why are you crying?

241
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,710
Yes, let's go. Okay?
Wipe your tears off.

242
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,440
Really?

243
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:53,940
Yeo Jin, you must've tried
to stop him from going.

244
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,350
I understand that you're worried.

245
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,649
But I'm his guardian,
so leave him to me.

246
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,750
You need to do a better job
as his guardian.

247
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,690
You almost lost him.

248
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,529
Both the boy and his guardian
want him to go.

249
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,269
What can I do?

250
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,269
Please don't worry.

251
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,679
I'm leaving, Grandma.

252
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,679
All right.
You can't follow anyone you know...

253
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,779
- or don't know.
- Okay.

254
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,450
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

255
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,789
- Let's go.
- Have fun.

256
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,460
I'm leaving.

257
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,309
Start the car.

258
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,509
I'm not taking your car.

259
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,879
Does she think she's Yoon Yu Jin?

260
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,379
What? What did you just say?

261
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,679
Nothing.

262
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,490
Take a hint if you heard that.

263
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,830
"Does she think she's Yoon Yu Jin?"

264
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,700
Is she saying I'm not Yoon Yu Jin?

265
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,710
He knew you were
the chairwoman's daughter...

266
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,870
and that Eun Chong was
at the hospital.

267
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,940
He could claim that he followed me
to the hospital,

268
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,980
but how did he know
I was living with my mom?

269
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,210
It was someone from that family.

270
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:40,279
Yoon Se Young's mom is
the most likely.

271
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,620
I agree.

272
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:44,960
Se Young must've overheard me
when I had the phone call...

273
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,360
asking to make the visit
seem spontaneous.

274
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,000
But Aunt Myung Ji has no reason
to stop me from adopting him.

275
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,330
Why did she do that?
That's what's confusing to me.

276
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,470
Because Eun Chong is the real one.

277
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,899
She may lose Hyesung Group to you...

278
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,539
if you become Eun Chong's mother.

279
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,379
I'll look more into Yoon Se Young
and her mother.

280
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,409
You can proceed
with Eun Chong's adoption...

281
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,549
without telling anyone.

282
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,250
Let's find another day to meet up
at Ji Chang's tteokbokki place.

283
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,950
We couldn't do that
because Eun Chong went missing.

284
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,289
While we're on the subject,
why don't we do it today?

285
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,330
I'd love to.

286
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:26,759
Mr. Hwang.

287
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,100
Ha Na, my mom told me...

288
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:37,539
that the awful man threatened you
by using Eun Chong.

289
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,210
Are you all right?

290
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,710
Were you not hurt?

291
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,210
No, thankfully,
everything ended without trouble.

292
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,519
You don't look okay.

293
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,350
You must be stressed out
because these things keep happening.

294
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,529
Mr. Hwang,
I can be honest with you, right?

295
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,629
Of course.

296
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,700
You should be honest
with your customer service rep.

297
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,500
I shouldn't feel this way,

298
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,710
but I kept feeling hurt
because of Mom.

299
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,210
I'm grateful that she cares so much
about Eun Chong,

300
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,279
- but something seems weird.
- How so?

301
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,080
She treats him
as if he's her real grandson.

302
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,789
It seems like she cherishes him...

303
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,590
more than me, her own daughter.

304
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,659
Yesterday,
she called him her grandson,

305
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,389
although it was a mistake.

306
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,860
She did?

307
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,269
I sounded like a whining kid,
didn't I?

308
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,200
No, you could feel that way.

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,669
I would've felt the same.

310
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,610
I was the daughter
she found again after 20 years.

311
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,350
She began to feel
more and more distant.

312
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,279
You should share your honest feelings
with the chairwoman.

313
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,090
I should, right?

314
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,789
I'm sorry.
This is an important call.

315
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,690
Let's talk again later.

316
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,190
Okay.

317
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,029
Yes, hello.

318
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,599
"Talk?"

319
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:16,609
Did you find the woman
who dated Goo Ji Seok?

320
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,240
Yes, her name is Yoon Se Young.

321
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,579
Wait, say that again?

322
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,250
Her name is Yoon Se Young.
She's 32 years old.

323
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,819
She studied Business Administration
at the same university as him.

324
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,589
Do you have a photo?

325
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,099
I'll send it to your phone.

326
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,339
When were they together?

327
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,480
It's been two years
since they broke up.

328
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,779
They broke up
when the woman went back to Korea.

329
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,619
All right.

330
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,519
Find more information
on their relationship.

331
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,059
Goodbye.

332
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,430
She broke up with Goo Ji Seok...

333
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,029
and began to date me
when she came to Korea.

334
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,839
What are you up to?

335
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,609
Jin Goo?

336
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,109
What's wrong? Is something going on?

337
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,779
You dated Goo Ji Seok?

338
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,089
Do you have something to say?

339
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,359
No. What is it?

340
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,460
Let's go to Mother's restaurant
on the weekend.

341
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,690
It must be tough to run the place,
so I want to help her out.

342
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,529
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

343
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,740
I need to go out for a moment.

344
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,009
What's with him?

345
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,829
You haven't married, have you?

346
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,329
Are you dating anyone?

347
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,670
We broke up. She was a poor woman.

348
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,640
She was like a marionette
on the strings her mother pulled.

349
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,410
She was affected by
every single word her mother said.

350
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,509
In the end, she broke up with me
because her mother said so.

351
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,049
He was talking about Se Young.

352
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,990
We were passionately in love,

353
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,289
so passionate that
we were burning for each other.

354
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,559
You held animosity against me
because of Se Young?

355
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,269
Are they still seeing each other?

356
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,150
- Is something interesting going on?
- Yes.

357
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,420
It's intriguing.

358
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,789
These days,
things must be great for you.

359
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,359
You successfully sold Hyesung Tour
and made up with Ms. Goo, too.

360
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,990
And you're seeing Se Young.

361
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,859
I'm not doing so badly.

362
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,900
Good luck with you, too, Mr. Hwang.

363
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,769
Stop bidding me good luck!

364
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,440
You said you'd expose
my hideous true nature, didn't you?

365
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,480
Just wait.

366
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,910
Mr. Goo, I'll also expose
your hideous true nature...

367
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:43,910
very soon.

368
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,559
My hideous true nature?

369
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,690
Did he find out
about my relationship with Se Young?

370
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:01,670
Did you look into ways
I could adopt Eun Chong?

371
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,940
Yes, I heard this
while talking to the person in charge.

372
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,039
Ms. Goo had asked them...

373
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,039
to make the home visit
seem spontaneous.

374
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,640
Make it seem spontaneous? Why?

375
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,480
There was a false report
on child abuse last time,

376
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,750
so she must've wanted
to keep it a secret.

377
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,849
And she kept it from me, too?

378
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,660
It would mean she could adopt him
without my knowledge.

379
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,259
I can't let this go on.

380
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,329
Summon Ha Na.

381
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,259
How about this one?
You don't like it?

382
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,430
Do you like that one?

383
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,170
Eun Chong, is there anything
you can't eat or don't like to eat?

384
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,240
No, I'm not picky.

385
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,410
Gosh.

386
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,509
- And you have no allergies?
- No.

387
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,279
Eun Chong,
if Auntie Ha Na weren't around,

388
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,819
who would you want to live with?

389
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,519
I want to live with Auntie Ha Na.

390
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,890
It's an if question.
Just think about it.

391
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,220
I don't want to.

392
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,700
Then, what will you do
when Auntie Ha Na dies?

393
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,759
Why would she die?

394
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,099
It's just an if question.

395
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,400
If you only want to live
with Auntie Ha Na,

396
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,940
then will you die with her
if she dies?

397
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,970
Why would she die?

398
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,839
I'm not saying she will.
It's an if...

399
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,650
I don't like that question.

400
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:26,349
Auntie Ha Na and I will
live together for a long time.

401
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,019
Fine.

402
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,589
Even this kid is tough to handle.

403
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,789
I need to pull him apart
from Goo Ha Na.

404
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,500
You don't want me
to adopt Eun Chong?

405
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,069
I gave this a thought.

406
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,900
You'll have to marry someone
in the future,

407
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,640
so Eun Chong...

408
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,809
I don't know if I'll ever marry.

409
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:52,380
And if I do, I'll marry someone
who's willing to be his dad.

410
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,549
You said your engagement was called off
because of him.

411
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,250
That was just an excuse.

412
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,250
Eun Chong wouldn't have been a problem
if he loved me.

413
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,319
You don't have to worry.

414
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,420
I'd manage everything
so that you wouldn't be concerned.

415
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,099
Then, what do you think
about letting me adopt him?

416
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,200
You, Mom?

417
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,029
I understand
how much you care about him.

418
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:20,869
If you're okay with it,
I'll adopt him myself.

419
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,569
Then, he'll have
a family register, too.

420
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,809
Why do you choose
to take this that far?

421
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,450
Just think of this...

422
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,720
half as my concern for you
and half as my concern for him.

423
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,420
Then, you should put me
on your family register first.

424
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,089
It'll take a while
for me to do that with you.

425
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,619
You're my biological daughter,

426
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,089
so you'll be in danger the moment
you're on my family register.

427
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,200
Eun Chong wasn't my blood,
so people wouldn't be as interested...

428
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,900
even if he were
on my family register.

429
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,769
Let me adopt him.

430
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,140
Thank you for the thought.

431
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,380
But it's proper for me to adopt him.

432
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,220
How can I let you do that?
This will change my daughter's life.

433
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,549
Both Eun Chong and I have
waited for this for a long time.

434
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:15,059
You can just help us out, Mom.

435
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,269
Mom, I have something to say.

436
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:24,599
Yes, sure.

437
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,369
I was also disappointed
and troubled...

438
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:30,869
when Eun Chong disappeared...

439
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:34,079
and the home visit was
canceled twice.

440
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,319
But why do you never ask...

441
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,680
about how I feel?

442
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,220
Right. I'm sorry.

443
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:50,529
I was so invested
in Eun Chong falling into danger,

444
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,759
so I didn't show
enough concern for you.

445
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:56,430
Please don't be sad
if you were hurt.

446
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,400
All right.

447
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,109
I'll pay more attention from now on.

448
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,740
Okay.

449
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,980
Right. And those people
from yesterday...

450
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,910
found out you were my daughter
and came to visit us at home.

451
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,950
What happened there?

452
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,779
I have no idea.

453
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,650
How did they find out?

454
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,490
Didn't you tell him?

455
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,990
Me?

456
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,430
No, I've never met him
after we broke up.

457
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,059
I ran into him for the 1st time
2 days ago.

458
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,000
I heard it came from you.

459
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,769
Says who?

460
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,710
Hey, Seok Ki.
Send me your mother's number.

461
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,250
Right now!

462
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,950
Who said I told him?

463
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,420
I think Yoon Se Young's mom is
hindering Eun Chong's adoption.

464
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,289
Yes, Chairwoman Shin wouldn't put on
a kidnapping show with her grandson.

465
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,400
If it were Yoon Se Young
and her mother,

466
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,130
they must be after Hyesung Group.

467
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,829
Then, she'll want
to kick your sister out...

468
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,029
and take advantage of Eun Chong.

469
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,599
Do you plan
to let Chairwoman Shin know?

470
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,509
How will she respond
when she finds out?

471
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Will she expose Eun Chong
as her actual grandson?

472
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,579
Or will she continue
to use Ha Na as a fake daughter?

473
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,380
I'm not so sure.

474
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,220
She'll want to maintain
the status quo.

475
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,319
Your sister's choice
will become the variable.

476
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,619
How will your sister react
if she finds out that she's a fake?

477
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:28,119
She'll either live
as a fake daughter for Eun Chong...

478
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,529
or leave that home with him.
It'll be either one of the two.

479
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,430
Will Chairwoman Shin
let Eun Chong go?

480
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,099
She won't.

481
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,799
That'll be a tough problem, too.

482
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,640
- Yes.
- But we have to find something...

483
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,240
to put pressure on Yoon Se Young
and her mom for your sister's sake.

484
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,450
Yes, I'm thinking about it.

485
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:02,960
Gosh, it had been so long
since all of us got together.

486
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,000
It's the first time
after the braised pollack.

487
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,700
Back then, I didn't know
I'd be a business owner.

488
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,670
Then, Mr. Business Owner,
is the feast on you?

489
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,140
Hey, it's on me.
You can order the entire menu.

490
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,680
- Su Ji.
- Yes?

491
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,539
Please get us other things
that aren't here yet.

492
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,680
Yes, Mr. Goo.

493
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,490
Uncle Ji Chang, you're so cool.

494
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,759
You finally have
a great judgment of character!

495
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,029
Hey, Ji Seok!

496
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:41,930
You're here.
Grab a seat and start your dinner.

497
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,130
Hello, Uncle Ji Seok.

498
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,640
You seemed like a kid before,
but you look like a business owner now.

499
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,380
Hey, I hold
a higher position than you.

500
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,240
You're a director,
but I'm the owner.

501
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,779
My goodness.

502
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,079
Hey, is our family about to speed our way
into happiness?

503
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,950
Ji Seok and Ha Na made up,

504
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,420
Eun Chong would get adopted
by Ha Na,

505
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,059
you became a business owner,
and I'd get married.

506
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,029
- You'll marry?
- Wait, with the guy from that time?

507
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,230
Ji Seok's secretary?

508
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,829
"Ji Seok's secretary?"
You're dating him?

509
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,099
You've met him, right?
How does he seem?

510
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,200
Well, he was good-looking.

511
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,900
Since when did you start dating him?

512
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,710
We're still
getting to know each other.

513
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:24,609
Jeez.

514
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,380
Well, if Ji Seok is okay with it,
he must be a good person.

515
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:30,750
- What's he like, Ji Seok?
- He's a great guy.

516
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:34,349
But I'm not sure
if he can handle Ji Eun.

517
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,619
What? What's so bad about me?

518
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,589
Auntie Ji Eun is pretty,
but that's about it.

519
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:46,000
- Hey, Eun Chong. You.
- You're so smart.

520
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,230
- You're so smart.
- My dear Eun Chong.

521
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,230
- You're the smartest.
- You're so smart.

522
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,839
- My gosh. I can't believe it.
- You're so smart.

523
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,079
Why aren't they back yet?

524
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,750
Hey, Mom.

525
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,549
Why are you this late?

526
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,190
- Is Eun Chong asleep?
- Yes.

527
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,859
It had been so long
since I chatted with my siblings,

528
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,160
so I didn't realize
the time flew by.

529
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,990
It's only been days
since what happened to him.

530
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,089
Why were you out this late?

531
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,200
You should be home by his bedtime
as his future mother.

532
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,970
- I'm sorry.
- Go upstairs.

533
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,240
Goodnight.

534
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,089
Why do I feel
more and more distant from Mom?

535
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,990
No, don't even have such an idea.

536
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,200
What happened today is over,

537
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,170
and the sun will
rise again tomorrow.

538
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,839
Right, Eun Chong?

539
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,240
Eun Chong.

540
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,880
You'll never get to see him again
until the day you die.

541
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,420
Who cares if you have
billions of dollars?

542
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,390
You can't even meet your grandson.

543
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,160
That's the punishment I give you.

544
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,500
Let's go, Eun Chong.

545
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,359
Eun Chong!

546
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:30,069
I don't like you, Grandma!

547
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,269
Eun Chong.

548
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,809
Eun Chong!

549
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,359
Eun Chong.

550
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,549
Hey. Okay. All right.

551
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,049
Eun Chong, my dear.

552
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,079
Oh, my dear.

553
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,059
You're so cute.

554
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,759
Why are you so cute?

555
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,930
Look over here.

556
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,200
Eun Chong.

557
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,960
There, there.

558
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,940
One, two.

559
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:49,440
- Mom.
- Peek-a-boo.

560
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,740
Peek-a-boo. Where do you want to go?

561
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,509
Here? Where?

562
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,480
Let's see. Where?

563
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,480
Which one?

564
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,650
Mom, why are you watching this
instead of sleeping?

565
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,819
Peek-a-boo.

566
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,750
(Cinderella Game)

567
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,750
Is Mr. Goo
the man she's seeing right now?

568
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,320
Was it a sin to have dated someone?

569
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,150
You're still seeing someone.

570
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,489
It's a matter of time
before the engagement is off.

571
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,389
Why is it a secret
that you're her daughter?

572
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,659
Who told you I was her daughter?

573
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:19,929
- Her daughter went missing at ten.
- I thought it was seven.

574
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,130
Did she notice that she was a fake?

575
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,230
I have to kick her out soon
before the suspicion grows.

576
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,239
I need to find something
to stop Choi Myung Ji immediately.

577
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,239
I don't know what Goo Ha Na will do
when she finds out she's a fake.

578
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,440
Could everything be a coincidence?
