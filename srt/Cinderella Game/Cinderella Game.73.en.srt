1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,380
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,850
By any chance, do you still
want to be Eun Chong's mom?

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,220
Why do you ask?

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,350
I want to know...

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,760
how you really feel.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,620
Did Se Young make you ask?

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,330
Or was it the chairwoman?

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,560
I was curious.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,300
If I say yes, will you help me?

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,170
Can you take my side?

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,440
I'll help you.

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,970
I'll take your side.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,880
Don't register...

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,450
your marriage before the wedding.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,390
And don't adopt Eun Chong, either.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,000
- Be careful.
- Okay.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,530
Careful.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,630
Have you called Jin Goo?

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,040
Yes, he's at our place.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600
He said
he'd go over to see Eun Chong.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
All right. You should take a few days off
and get some rest.

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,040
- And please visit the doctor.
- Yes, Mother.

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,550
And we should
register their marriage, too.

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,150
I'll talk to Jin Goo.

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,790
I don't want Se Young
to become Eun Chong's mom.

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,890
She's only doing this
to get Hyesung Group.

29
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,060
Eun Chong doesn't want it either,

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,760
so I want to stop this for his sake.

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,770
Can you trust me
no matter what I do...

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,900
or what I say?

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,610
I will trust you.

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,680
We'll start the adoption process
as soon as we're married.

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,640
So, what can I help you with?

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,980
I'll tell you
when the right time comes.

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,110
Do you have a plan?

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,420
There's another time for that, too.

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,750
Okay.

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,330
The chairwoman wishes to see you.

41
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,260
All right.

42
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
Keep your eyes on Ha Na.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,440
She probably came in here
with a thorough plan to steal Eun Chong.

44
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,740
You have an advantage even if she wants
to fight for his custody.

45
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,680
Why are you worried?

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,750
She began to come between me and him
because of that disadvantage.

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,150
She continuously
provokes me, irritates me,

48
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,720
and even makes me feel humiliated.

49
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,560
She's not the same as before.

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,860
She may be the same person,

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,730
but she cannot be the same
as she was before.

52
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,900
She's been through a lot,

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,630
and she was deeply hurt, too.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
Even so, how dare she even think
of stealing Eun Chong from me?

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,810
Do you have another plan
if she refuses to give up?

56
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,910
I'm thinking of something.

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,880
Once again, will you lock her up
in a place like a mental institution?

58
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,380
I want to see you two reconcile.

59
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,690
If you continue to fight,
it'll be a battle without a winner,

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,490
a glory tarnished with pain.

61
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,230
And because you two are
the most important to Eun Chong,

62
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,670
it'll hurt him the most.

63
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,370
There is an outcome in every fight.

64
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,870
She won't get to leave in one piece
after messing with me under my roof.

65
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,240
Then, what?

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,410
I'm sensing some undertone.

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,910
I'm just saying.

68
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,350
I don't want to see...

69
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,550
both you and Ha Na lose.

70
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,250
And I don't want to meddle
with this fight, either.

71
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,050
So, you'll turn a blind eye to this?

72
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,890
You're going to be Eun Chong's dad.

73
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,330
I don't think it's my place
to interfere with his custody.

74
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,860
But I will help out
when you two are...

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
willing to reconcile.

76
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,840
<i>You better hide well</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

77
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,240
<i>You better hide well</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

78
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,450
It's the baby tummy.

79
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,750
Auntie Ha Na.

80
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,320
Why didn't you hide?

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,290
- This is the baby tummy.
- The baby tummy?

82
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,330
What's this?

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
Where did you find this?

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,600
In Little Grandma's room.

85
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,170
Little Grandma's room?

86
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,810
But your baby fell.

87
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,270
What?

88
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,580
Eun Chong, last time,
you said the baby fell.

89
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,910
How did the baby fall?

90
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,020
Auntie Se Young
had this around her tummy,

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,350
then she dropped it when I saw her.

92
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,270
Wait, is Se Young...

93
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,270
faking her pregnancy?

94
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,010
What are you up to?

95
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,910
- What's that?
- Nothing.

96
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,550
Eun Chong, go to the playroom
with Mr. Hwang and play there.

97
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,550
Okay. Mr. Hwang,
let me show you the playroom.

98
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,620
Okay.

99
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,990
Se Young, you can't be serious.

100
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
She's faking her pregnancy?

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,840
She has artificial baby bumps
according to different stages.

102
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,880
Did you catch a cold?

103
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,710
It's my allergy. I'll be fine
once I take my medicine.

104
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
Se Young recently said
she was taking allergy medicine.

105
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,490
I also found it odd back then.

106
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,220
I'll look for her medicine.

107
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,890
Be careful.

108
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,330
I heard you could've gotten badly hurt.

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,030
She was extremely lucky
to be fine like this.

110
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,640
She needs to get
some peaceful rest in her room,

111
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,740
but she doesn't have one
because of Ha Na.

112
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,080
It must be uncomfortable for her
to sleep in my bed.

113
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,610
I'll get married soon, anyway.

114
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,180
It may be for a few days,

115
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,180
but the mother needs to be rested
for the baby to do well.

116
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,520
I'll find a room for you.

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
Really, Yeo Jin?

118
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,460
But we don't have more rooms.

119
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,990
We do.

120
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,510
(Morning, Evening)

121
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,650
Is this her medicine?

122
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,870
Auntie, come and join us.

123
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,430
Okay. What's this?

124
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,970
Hey, do you do it like this?

125
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,970
One, two, three.

126
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,340
I keep seeing only these.

127
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,480
- Eun Chong, flip the next one.
- Which one?

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,750
Hurry up.

129
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,420
- No!
- Jin Goo.

130
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,520
- What?
- You're here.

131
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,490
Were you hurt?

132
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,820
You're faking your pregnancy?

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,830
What are you looking at?

134
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,160
It's nothing. Did something happen?

135
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,170
I rolled down the stairs
after visiting Jin Goo's place.

136
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,500
What about the baby?
Is the baby okay?

137
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,910
Yes, this could've been very bad
for me and my baby.

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,740
I'm so glad
everything is fine, Jin Goo.

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,110
Yes, we were quite lucky.

140
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,710
You aren't pregnant,
so you should be fine.

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,880
Eun Chong, were you playing
with your daddy?

142
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,730
"Home Survey?"

143
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,360
(Mother: Goo Ha Na)

144
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,830
"Mother. Goo Ha..."

145
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,040
- What's wrong?
- Why did you rip this up?

146
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,410
I have to give that to my teacher.

147
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,880
Jin Goo, will you and Eun Chong
step outside for a minute?

148
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,210
I have to talk to Ha Na.

149
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,820
Please do not fight.

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,020
Eun Chong, let's go outside.

151
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,890
Let's go.

152
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,530
Did you forget that I was his mom?

153
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,700
Are you doing this
to rub it into my face?

154
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,070
What do you get
from stressing me out?

155
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,700
Do you want the worst
to happen to the baby?

156
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,770
Did you just laugh?

157
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,410
Sorry. I keep forgetting
that you're pregnant.

158
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,150
You should put on some more weight.

159
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,110
Who's going to see you
and think you're pregnant?

160
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,320
What about your morning sickness?
Is it over?

161
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,290
- Mind your own business.
- I just felt bad.

162
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,720
I failed to treat you well
and kept stressing you out...

163
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,330
all because
I forgot you were pregnant.

164
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,860
What's this sudden shift?

165
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,330
I took your room
and did that on the home survey.

166
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,530
I want to apologize for stressing you out
without realizing it.

167
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,240
- Let's meet outside tomorrow.
- Forget it.

168
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,170
How dare you ask a pregnant woman
to come and go?

169
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,340
Don't say that and meet me.

170
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,010
We can discuss Eun Chong, too.

171
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,510
What about him?

172
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,350
It's something you'll need
and can benefit from.

173
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,720
You can re-download this
and fill it out with Eun Chong.

174
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,520
I'll call you tomorrow.

175
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,330
What does she want to say
about Eun Chong?

176
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,230
She wrote down her name
as his mom to rub it into my face.

177
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,430
I should talk to Yeo Jin.

178
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,400
You were probably bruised
after rolling down the stairs.

179
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,540
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I feel a bit stiff,

180
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,740
but I wasn't bruised. I'm fine.

181
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,210
You may feel a throbbing pain
when you wake up tomorrow.

182
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,550
You can't even take medicine,
so I'm worried.

183
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,980
Jin Goo, I'll look after Se Young,

184
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,190
so go be Eun Chong's dad.

185
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,820
You have to make
a good impression on him...

186
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,220
to make him want to be your son.

187
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,630
So, stop by often, too. Okay?

188
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,060
Okay.

189
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,560
Let's register our marriage,
Jin Goo.

190
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,370
I want to adopt him
as soon as possible.

191
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,170
We're done talking about this.

192
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,570
Can't you just do it?

193
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,740
Se Young is stressed out...

194
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,240
while Ha Na is strutting around
like she's his mom.

195
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,910
By any chance, do you still
want to be Eun Chong's mom?

196
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,280
If I say yes, will you help me?

197
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,320
Can you take my side?

198
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,560
Yes, I'll get married,

199
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,700
and Ha Na will adopt Eun Chong.

200
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,730
That's the most reasonable
right now.

201
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,800
You can take tomorrow off
and get some rest.

202
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,340
Please excuse me.

203
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,340
Oh, but...

204
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,480
- Good grief.
- How irritating.

205
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,090
Se Young and Eun Chong will
share a room starting today...

206
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,950
in the room Ms. Goo had been using.

207
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,190
It makes no sense for a pregnant woman
to share a bed with me.

208
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,530
Thank you, Yeo Jin.

209
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,500
"A pregnant woman?"

210
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,700
Eun Chong has a bad sleeping habit.

211
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,030
What if he kicks her in the stomach
in his sleep?

212
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,640
I ordered another bed for him.

213
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,010
Eun Chong, you're now old enough
to sleep on your own.

214
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,810
Then, where will Auntie Ha Na sleep?

215
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,380
I don't know.

216
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,950
According to the contract,
I have full rights...

217
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,590
over Eun Chong's care.

218
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,490
It's important
to care for Eun Chong,

219
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,390
but you should be considerate
of the pregnant, too.

220
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,060
Thank you, Aunt Yeo Jin.

221
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,530
She doesn't even know
she's fooled by a fake pregnancy.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,270
Eun Chong, your mommy will be
Auntie Se Young, so sleep with her.

223
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,970
I don't want to.
You're trying to kick Auntie Ha Na out.

224
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,740
No, it's just that we don't have
another room in this house.

225
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,640
Then, you can empty out your room!

226
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,550
Eun Chong, you can't tell her
to empty out her room.

227
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,850
I'm not going to school
if you don't give the room back...

228
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,220
to Auntie Ha Na!

229
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,590
You still need to go to school.

230
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,960
Yes, Eun Chong.

231
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,790
You're in elementary school now.
You can't whine like a baby.

232
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,630
I hate you, too, Auntie Se Young!

233
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,500
What? Why me, all of a sudden?

234
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,400
Eun Chong,
why don't we make a new room?

235
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,840
Really?

236
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,240
Ta-da!

237
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,950
This is the tent
from our home, right?

238
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,550
Yes, I brought it here
to camp with you in the garden.

239
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,980
We can just do it
in the living room.

240
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,220
All right! We're camping!

241
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,230
Wait, you want to make him sleep
in the living room?

242
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,770
Then, give her room back.

243
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,370
She never had a room in this house.

244
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,770
You're bad, Grandma!

245
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,510
- Let's go to school, Eun Chong.
- Okay.

246
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,980
Get rid of this now.

247
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,080
This is a room for Eun Chong and me.

248
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,110
Can't you see how thrilled he is?

249
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,080
I already told you
I'd tailor this house...

250
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,220
according to Eun Chong's needs.

251
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,160
It'll be a breach of contract
if you lay a hand on the tent.

252
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,890
Let's go, Eun Chong.

253
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,470
Where did she find
this piece of trash?

254
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,810
Eun Chong turned into
Goo Ha Na's toy.

255
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,110
Yeo Jin, will you let her do this?

256
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,620
Isn't it about time
you make use of the money...

257
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
you gave to her siblings?

258
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,190
I've been thinking about it.

259
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,290
- A fake pregnancy?
- A fake pregnancy?

260
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,860
Were both Chairwoman Shin
and Hwang Jin Goo deceived?

261
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,370
Yes, and she trusted those two
and let them adopt her grandson.

262
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,270
She'll feel...

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,400
greatly betrayed and disappointed
if this breaks off their marriage.

264
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,110
If her fake pregnancy gets exposed,

265
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,340
both the marriage
and the adoption will be over.

266
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,110
I'll drop the news
on their wedding day.

267
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,050
I'll begin investigating the company
after breaking the wedding off.

268
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,550
You can start the investigation
with Hyesung Tour's disposal.

269
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,520
You can make your case...

270
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,620
with Chairwoman Shin approving
the disposal over personal reasons.

271
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,730
Yes, sir.

272
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,060
Soon, it'll be the 30th anniversary
of their foundation day,

273
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,630
and Chairwoman Shin will
also come to an end.

274
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,020
Didn't you get what it meant
when I cleaned out your room?

275
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,480
You're telling me to leave.

276
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,090
Yet you're holding out,

277
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,890
so it must mean you want
to take this to the end with me.

278
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,720
I'll leave after a month.
Why can't you tolerate me?

279
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,730
Eun Chong is doing better,
so you don't have to stay for a month.

280
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,230
The wedding is coming right up,

281
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,030
so they'll go ahead
and start the adoption right away.

282
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,030
We'll have to see
if they'll marry...

283
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,330
or adopt him.

284
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,470
As you already know,
who knows what the future holds?

285
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,410
You're only saying that
because you don't want this.

286
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,280
Do you trust Yoon Se Young?

287
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,850
What about Hwang Jin Goo?

288
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,620
What do you mean?

289
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,050
I'm asking you. What do you mean?

290
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,620
You don't trust anyone,

291
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,190
yet you seem to firmly believe...

292
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,290
those two will adopt
your precious grandson.

293
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,360
Do you know something?

294
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,400
What would I know?

295
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,110
How are Se Young and Jin Goo doing
these days?

296
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,910
Nothing much is going on...

297
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,150
other than wedding preparations.

298
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,620
What's wrong?

299
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,320
Ha Na just asked
if I trusted Se Young and Jin Goo,

300
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,790
and it seemed like
something was going on.

301
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,160
- Should I look into it?
- Yes.

302
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,690
I also can't condone her anymore.

303
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
Set up everything to pressure her
with the investments I made...

304
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,300
- in her siblings.
- Yes, ma'am.

305
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,240
She'll only come to her senses
after she sits on a hefty debt.

306
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,540
How dare she keep Eun Chong
under her control in my house?

307
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,610
- You tent out in the living room?
- Yes.

308
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,910
Eun Chong took the lead
and put up a fight...

309
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,350
when she cleaned out my room,
trying to kick me out.

310
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,780
It was nice to have him there.

311
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm just saying.

312
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,460
What about Se Young's medicine?
Did you look into it?

313
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,260
Yes, I asked a pharmacist,

314
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,900
and these allergy meds were
too strong for pregnant women.

315
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,570
It proves that
she's faking her pregnancy.

316
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,040
Why does she want to go this far
just to marry him?

317
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,340
She's after Hyesung Group,
not Hwang Jin Goo.

318
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,080
Once we drop this,
it'll break off their wedding,

319
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,780
end Eun Chong's adoption,

320
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,510
and put an end
to Se Young's life, too.

321
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,680
- So, the D-day is their wedding?
- Yes.

322
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,650
I have to get clearance
to the security server...

323
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,650
from Se Young before then.

324
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,560
But she asked me to help
with Eun Chong's adoption in return.

325
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,760
What am I supposed to do?

326
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,960
I'll give you the files
I got for the adoption screening...

327
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,830
and other references I put together.

328
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,070
Don't tell her that it's from me.

329
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,170
Pretend like you found it
and take credit for it.

330
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,340
I should do that.

331
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,810
Why aren't you at work?

332
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,980
I fell down the stairs yesterday.

333
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,380
The stairs? Is the baby okay?

334
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,120
Yes, thankfully, the baby is fine.

335
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,020
How will you help me
with the adoption?

336
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,390
I'm ready to hand over
the clearance to the server.

337
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,230
I'll grab the files she prepared
for Eun Chong's adoption...

338
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,630
and give them to you.

339
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,370
That's not much.

340
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,830
Let me know if you need anything.

341
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,570
I'll do it if it's within my power.

342
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,070
That's a no, then.

343
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,710
You'll have to do it
even if it's not in your power.

344
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,150
- What is it?
- Make Ha Na give up on his custody.

345
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,850
She asked you
to make me give up on his custody?

346
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,720
Once I exposed her fake pregnancy,

347
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,590
her marriage and Eun Chong's adoption
would be over.

348
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,360
So, I just said yes.

349
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,160
Good call.

350
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,230
I'll find good timing
to pretend like I'm giving up,

351
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,470
so get the clearance from her
as soon as you can.

352
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,200
Okay. Bye.

353
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,510
She told him
to make me give up on his custody?

354
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,660
You're here. Have a seat.

355
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,200
Why are we suddenly seeing
an oriental doctor?

356
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,570
Why are we here?

357
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,900
Do you need medicine?

358
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,830
- It's not me. It's you.
- Me?

359
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,570
I'll buy you an herbal tonic
great for pregnant women.

360
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,840
No, it's okay.
I don't take herbal tonics anyway.

361
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,080
Even if you don't want to,
just take it...

362
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,240
for your baby.

363
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,710
I don't want to. What's with you?

364
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,210
Then, let the doctor feel your pulse
and give you acupuncture treatment.

365
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,650
You rolled down the stairs.

366
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,890
Ms. Yoon Se Young.

367
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,550
Yes.

368
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,890
- Let's go inside.
- I don't want to.

369
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,760
Why are you adamant on this?
Just let the doctor feel your pulse.

370
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,230
Wait, I need to go to the restroom.

371
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
Hey, it's inside.

372
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,330
Over there.

373
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,070
(Restrooms)

374
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,170
Go on.

375
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,420
You had a lot of fun
when you found out...

376
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,990
I was a fake daughter, didn't you?

377
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,560
It's also a lot of fun...

378
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,220
to see you in this fake pregnancy.

379
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,370
Darn it. There are no windows.

380
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,340
Mom, Ha Na just brought me
to see an oriental doctor...

381
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,480
to buy an herbal tonic
for pregnancy.

382
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,010
What? Why...

383
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,910
Why is she doing this
out of the blue?

384
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,180
Get out of there now.

385
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,580
I tried to run away
by pretending to go to the restroom,

386
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,690
but it was inside the hospital,
so I got stuck.

387
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,320
Did she call you there...

388
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,720
because she found out something?

389
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,430
No way.

390
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,860
Mom, please save me from here.

391
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,300
You're already at a hospital,
so collapsing won't do any...

392
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,300
Yes, your phone.
Take a look at your phone.

393
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,840
My phone?

394
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,050
- What's that?
- What's this sound?

395
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,290
What? Is there a fire?

396
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,460
Hey, there must be a fire.

397
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,320
We have to get out of here.

398
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,340
What is this?
Things got quiet after she left.

399
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,490
Did she just play the fire alarm
on her phone?

400
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,620
She's pulling all kinds of tricks
not to expose her fake pregnancy.

401
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,200
My gosh.
I was so worried she'd find out.

402
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,540
How did you come up with the idea
to download the fire alarm app?

403
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,640
You're the queen of tricks.

404
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,610
Do you think she knows something?

405
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,220
Did you do anything
to let her catch on?

406
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,650
No.

407
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,560
Maybe she saw
the artificial baby bump.

408
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,860
Darn it.

409
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,200
Is it okay to leave these here?

410
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,440
Should we put them in the safe?

411
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,840
Ha Na must be here.
Let me feel her out.

412
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,050
Why did the siren go off?

413
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,820
No idea.
It got quiet after you left.

414
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,760
Really?

415
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,300
The thought of a fire made me scared
into thinking I'd lose my baby.

416
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,800
Why are you laughing?

417
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,940
What you said
about losing your baby...

418
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,070
reminded me of this story
I heard on the radio on the bus.

419
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,170
It was hilarious.

420
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,080
I heard you went to see
an oriental doctor with Se Young.

421
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,680
Is something funny going on?

422
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,350
Yes, this story on the radio...

423
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,890
Enough. Stop stressing her out,
then try to make her better.

424
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,560
Herbal tonic, my foot.

425
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,360
Your priority is
not giving stress to the pregnant.

426
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,430
Do you understand?

427
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,130
Se Young is Eun Chong's mother.

428
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,070
Sure.

429
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,050
Do you want to listen to the story
I heard on the radio?

430
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm not interested.

431
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,620
It was the story of a woman
who got married by faking her pregnancy.

432
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,490
Be careful.

433
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,400
I couldn't understand
even as I listened to it.

434
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,170
Why would she want to go that far
to hold him back?

435
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,070
He was already done with her,
so why would she want him?

436
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,540
Does she know something or what?

437
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,210
But that woman was...

438
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,110
after something else
other than love.

439
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,340
It's always money, isn't it?

440
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,650
Do you know what's worse?

441
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,890
The man knew the pregnancy was fake,

442
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,620
yet he stayed quiet.

443
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,390
What? Why?

444
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,590
Did he love her that much?

445
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,430
No.

446
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,660
He kept it quiet
until the last minute, then...

447
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,040
I can't tell you more.

448
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,140
The ending was too cruel.

449
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,640
What is it?

450
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,280
- Later.
- Why did you stop there?

451
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,680
This story is about you.
Don't you get it?

452
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,190
She's talking about me, right?

453
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,720
She took you to an oriental doctor,
then this fake pregnancy story.

454
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,060
It does sound like
she told the story for you to hear.

455
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,030
I once told her
the story of a woman...

456
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,200
who was conned as a fake daughter
after I found out about her.

457
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,470
It's a total parody.

458
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,040
On top of that, her laughter, too.

459
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,670
How did she find out
I was faking it?

460
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,780
We don't know that for sure.

461
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,950
I need to make that girl
go out of her mind.

462
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,660
How's everything
with your siblings' business?

463
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,590
I kept telling myself to visit,
but I never did.

464
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,730
Sure, it's going well.

465
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,570
You should've backed out quietly
after Yeo Jin...

466
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,870
helped with their business
and gave them money.

467
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,840
Why did you move in here
to take Eun Chong from us?

468
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,350
Why? Do you want
to take Hyesung, too?

469
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,080
"Gave them money?"

470
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,720
Your petty siblings came
and took a hefty sum from her...

471
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,190
in return for raising Eun Chong.

472
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,100
If you two don't leave,

473
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,370
- I'll kill both of you...
- You!

474
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,340
You have to pay us back quickly
after borrowing from us.

475
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,470
Pay back the principal
and the interest right away!

476
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,340
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

477
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,440
The chairwoman
gave you that investment...

478
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,480
by taking out a loan from us.

479
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,680
A private loan?

480
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,520
We simply got the investment.

481
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,790
What investment?

482
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,060
Hey, next time, we may even snap...

483
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,030
your legs in half.

484
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,500
Make sure you handle everything.

485
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,460
- You little...
- No!

486
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,530
Let's go.

487
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,470
What are we going to do?

488
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,680
Wait. Let me call Ms. Jang.

489
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,110
Who were they?

490
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,480
- Ha Na...
- Ha Na...

491
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,900
"Mother, Yoon Se Young.
Father, Hwang Jin Goo."

492
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,530
"Grandmother, Shin Yeo Jin."

493
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,600
Eun Chong, I'll put
your home survey in here.

494
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,810
You can give it to your teacher.

495
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,050
We're done writing the home survey,

496
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,580
so why don't we call your daddy?

497
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,590
Hey, Jin Goo. What are you up to?

498
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,030
I'm playing with Eun Chong at home.

499
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,430
Where are you going?
Do you want some snacks?

500
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,130
What's Ha Na doing?
Why is he with you?

501
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm his mom, so of course,
he needs to be with me.

502
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,040
She ran over to her siblings.

503
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,640
I guess she didn't know
her siblings took money from my aunt.

504
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,440
They took money from the chairwoman?

505
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,650
- How much?
- A total of one million dollars.

506
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,350
Did the chairwoman do that
to hold it against her?

507
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,050
All right. I'm hanging up.

508
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,230
(Ms. Goo Ha Na)

509
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,200
Is she at her siblings' business?

510
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,440
You two must've gone insane.

511
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,840
Why did you take that money?

512
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,810
We had to take money
for raising Eun Chong.

513
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,880
Why wouldn't we take it
when she offered it first?

514
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,950
She seemed happy
that we took the money.

515
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,150
But we didn't know
she got it from loan sharks.

516
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,020
Why did she con us like this?

517
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,160
So, why did you take money
without talking to me first?

518
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,960
Give it back right away.

519
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,630
This isn't money. It's poison.

520
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,530
I made an investment.

521
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,840
"Investment?"

522
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,700
In what?

523
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,140
In the stock market, real estate,
and cryptocurrency.

524
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,750
What more did you take from her?

525
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,280
We recently received...

526
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,890
an additional investment.

527
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,220
- How much?
- One million dollars.

528
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,590
So, in total, two million dollars?

529
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,600
Did you sign a contract
when you got the additional investment?

530
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,260
Mr. Hwang.

531
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
We did. Why?

532
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,300
Show me.

533
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,600
Wait.

534
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,300
Now.

535
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,010
All these clauses look toxic.

536
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,750
That's disadvantageous
for us, right?

537
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,780
Yes, this looks serious.
It was an unfair contract.

538
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,950
She set this trap
on my naive siblings on purpose.

539
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,460
- I have to tell Ji Seok.
- No, Ha Na.

540
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,530
Ha Na, please don't tell Ji Seok.

541
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,630
Let go of me. Ji Seok needs to know.

542
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,280
What is this?
Where are your manners?

543
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,550
No, what are you doing?

544
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,820
How dare you go on
to mess with my siblings?

545
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,830
I didn't mess with them.

546
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,330
I gave them money
because they wanted it.

547
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,130
You still claim they wanted this...

548
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,030
after writing up
a contract like this?

549
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,200
I can't believe you used
your corporate raiding scheme on them.

550
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,040
How do you call yourself human?

551
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,010
"Corporate raiding?"

552
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,780
Should I sue you for defamation?

553
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,850
You'll have to pay two million,
the penalty, and for the damage.

554
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,250
I'll give you a chance to save them.
It's your choice.

555
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,290
One. Get away from Eun Chong...

556
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,390
and go live quietly without a trace.
Two.

557
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,590
Sacrifice your siblings
on this mountain of debt.

558
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
What do you think you're doing?

559
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,840
Three. Fight until the end.

560
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,840
My siblings won't become sacrifices,

561
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,980
and I'll never give
Eun Chong to you, either.

562
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,350
I'll take him from you.

563
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,510
(Cinderella Game)

564
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,680
Reconduct the investigation,

565
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,520
especially on Mr. Goo's parents.

566
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,720
What about the clearance
to the security server?

567
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,790
I want to move out
and live my own life.

568
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,390
We must escape from this house.

569
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,390
What did she say to Eun Chong?

570
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,960
She must've gaslighted him.

571
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,630
It looks like you have a plan.
Can you tell me what it is?

572
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,890
We must hasten this.

573
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,000
You'll find out soon.

574
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,830
Your tummy looks thinner.

575
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,530
Is this little kid
trying to attack me?

576
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,070
Please help us.

577
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,840
They have become
the worst burdens for Ha Na.

578
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,640
Give up
on getting Eun Chong's custody.
