1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,379
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,940
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,519
What are you doing in my room?

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,989
(Episode 42)

6
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,239
Why did she touch the picture?

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,240
Who's that?

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,009
Eun Chong and his mom.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,009
I brought his plush back.

10
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:42,850
It was on my bed.

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,780
Thanks.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,649
How does it feel
to become a Cinderella overnight?

13
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,829
I'm just curious.

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,060
You've been there, too.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,100
I heard you took my place
after they lost me.

16
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,530
Then, that makes you a Cinderella.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Did you hope I'd come back?

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,280
Or did you hope I'd never return?

19
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,780
Did you ever hope I was dead?

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,920
Stop!

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,189
What's wrong?

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,590
No, it's nothing.

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
I hope you also find out
how it feels to instantly turn...

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,299
into a lady-in-waiting
from an heiress.

25
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:39,969
Do you have something to say?

26
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,340
I hope you'll die.

27
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,480
Were they your foster parents?

28
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,079
Aunt Yeo Jin may see that
and feel sad.

29
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,189
You put it on display
as if you want her to see it.

30
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,729
It's Kongkong.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,939
- What happened to Kongkong's arm?
- What?

32
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,349
What happened to Kongkong's arm?

33
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,870
Gosh, she seems so familiar.

34
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:45,139
Where could I have met
that little kid's mom?

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,439
Come in.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,280
What happened to this?

37
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:54,909
One of its arms almost came off.

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,780
- Really?
- Why are you asking me?

39
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,919
How would I know?

40
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,819
Kongkong has been in your room
since late at night until now.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,120
"Kongkong?"
Is that the plush's name?

42
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,789
It's Eun Chong's favorite plush.

43
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,889
It was fine until yesterday night.

44
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,370
Are you saying I did that?

45
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,039
I was at work all day.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,099
I'm doing my best
to get along with you.

47
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,969
Do you hate me that much?

48
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,909
Then, what happened to this?

49
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,639
How would I know?

50
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,150
Someone might have done that
to slander me!

51
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,680
"Slander?"

52
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,120
- Who would do that?
- How would I know?

53
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,460
I get that you hate me,
but stop blaming the innocent.

54
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,860
Things are already tough enough!

55
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,199
Did you mean I tried to frame you
after doing this?

56
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,729
Didn't that feel unjust?

57
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,330
I felt the same way.

58
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,270
Did you have evidence I did that
other than how it was in my room?

59
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,569
Then, bring it to me!

60
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,240
What's wrong, you two?

61
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,169
What's going on?

62
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,210
I guess Yu Jin hates me, Mom.

63
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,479
She suddenly brought
Eun Chong's plush here...

64
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,379
and blamed me for how it was ruined.

65
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,680
- That wasn't...
- Forget it.

66
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,150
Let's just say it was all my fault.

67
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,560
It was my fault that
Eun Chong came in here and slept...

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,590
and how that plush
somehow got ruined.

69
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,990
It's all on me.

70
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,730
Goodness.

71
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,129
Kongkong's arm almost came off?

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,439
Yes. Kongkong's arm is dangly.

73
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,310
What happened?

74
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,709
I'll buy you a new one.

75
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:35,250
- You can't buy Kongkong.
- Why not?

76
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,379
Eun Chong,
I'll stitch it up for you.

77
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,319
Is that something I can't buy?

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,089
Eun Chong's mom
and I made this plush together.

79
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,529
You and Eun Chong's mom?

80
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,930
She made it
while she was pregnant with him.

81
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,329
But she passed away
without finishing it,

82
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,730
so I did.

83
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,769
I see.

84
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,779
It must be
very special and precious...

85
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,449
to Eun Chong.

86
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,589
Kongkong is
Eun Chong's first friend.

87
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,220
Is there a way to fix this?

88
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,160
I'll put a cloth over it
and stitch it up.

89
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,759
I'll stitch it up for you.
Don't cry.

90
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,230
Okay.

91
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,569
But who did that to Kongkong's arm?

92
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,879
Where did you find him?

93
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,279
Well, it was
in Auntie Se Young's room.

94
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,250
You must've left him there.

95
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,850
Why did the plush get ruined?

96
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,290
Someone must've pulled it out
or trampled all over it.

97
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,959
It became completely ragged.

98
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,230
- I heard it was in Se Young's room.
- Yes.

99
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,899
It was already like that
when she found it.

100
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,100
We already had trouble this morning
because of Eun Chong,

101
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,139
and it happened yet again.

102
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,370
Make sure
there is no trouble at home,

103
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,209
no matter how trivial it may seem.

104
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,279
Yes, just think of this
as the price we pay...

105
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,980
for having a new family.

106
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,050
I'll buy you a new plush.

107
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,689
My mom and Auntie Ha Na
made him together.

108
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,290
Is that so?

109
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,620
Then, should I make one again?

110
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,230
His mom made it.
Don't you understand?

111
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,129
I understood.

112
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,170
She's unusually mad about this.

113
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll just fix it.

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,009
Anyway, Yu Jin.

115
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,879
Why don't you wear
the necklace I gave you?

116
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,720
I wonder if Ha Na is doing okay.

117
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,689
That poor woman
suddenly became Cinderella,

118
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:55,990
so it'd be tough to adapt.

119
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,220
But still, she'll do a great job.

120
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,689
She's the most adaptable person
in this country.

121
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,930
Ji Seok, will you really
never see her again?

122
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,329
That was already sealed.
Don't ask me again.

123
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,329
Why are you doing this, Ji Seok?

124
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,899
It's as if she's your enemy.

125
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,269
- Chairwoman Shin...
- Did you take money from her?

126
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,339
What?
Why would I take money from her?

127
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,610
It's more like a credit card.

128
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,519
Anyway, Ji Seok.
When will you show me your girl?

129
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,819
What girl?

130
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,649
I saw you on the day
of our parents' memorial.

131
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,290
I figured her out immediately
after seeing her shoes.

132
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,819
She's the luxurious type
from a rich neighborhood.

133
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,930
- Are you going to marry her?
- There's no woman.

134
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,629
You even brought her home.

135
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,029
I don't even remember that.

136
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,100
We must've met at a bar.

137
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:45,300
That was disappointing.
Are you that type?

138
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,139
Right. Ji Seok. May I see Danny?

139
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,279
Weren't you going abroad to study?

140
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,279
Yes, I will.

141
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,129
Sir, I decided to open my business
with this tteokbokki franchise.

142
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:16,629
Gen Z kids love this place,
so I'll have good business.

143
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,370
This place has unique tteokbokki...

144
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,939
and attracts many young customers,
so it'll be great.

145
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,579
Don't you like it, too?

146
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,410
You should
look into it a little more...

147
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,180
and start planning everything.

148
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,949
So, how will you pay for it?

149
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,259
There's a big investor
waiting for me.

150
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,059
Let's see.
Gosh, it looks great on you.

151
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,659
That necklace found its owner.

152
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,529
What do you think, Yeo Jin?

153
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,529
It looks good on you.

154
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,600
Auntie Ha Na, it looks great.

155
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,470
It's pretty.

156
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,940
Thank you.

157
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,039
Yes, you should be quite thankful.

158
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,210
A girl like you
doesn't deserve that kind of luxury,

159
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,649
not even in your dreams.

160
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,250
Yu Jin, why don't you go through
an image consultation?

161
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,090
There will come a day
when I show you as my daughter,

162
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,360
- so let's find a style for you.
- Okay.

163
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,659
Ms. Jang will find someone for you.

164
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,230
Why don't I do it, Aunt Yeo Jin?

165
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,299
I can be a good coach
and improve her image.

166
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,570
Yes, Yeo Jin.

167
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,700
Se Young is
also a fashion influencer.

168
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,509
It's a perfect match.

169
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,440
You two will grow closer
in the process, too.

170
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,950
You two can discuss this
and figure something out.

171
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,379
Okay.

172
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,419
Let's do a color analysis first.

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,750
- Throw all these out.
- My gosh.

174
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,419
These?

175
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,629
I wear all these.

176
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,830
Do you know how important
clothes are for your image?

177
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,700
You're Yoon Yu Jin, not Goo Ha Na.

178
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,429
Think of Aunt Yeo Jin's reputation.

179
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,870
You can't wear just anything.

180
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:02,809
There's nothing you can wear.

181
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,039
You should
just throw out your closet.

182
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,779
Anyway, Eun Chong's mom
looked familiar.

183
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,250
She's a Korean-American.

184
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,990
You probably have never met her.

185
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,360
"A Korean-American?"

186
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,090
Have I met her at school?

187
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,259
So, why did she die?

188
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,360
A car accident.

189
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,700
What will you wear when you go out
with Aunt Yeo Jin tomorrow?

190
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,000
What's the theme?

191
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,200
We decided to do the things...

192
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,940
I wanted to do if I had a mom.

193
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,440
You know you should
dress appropriately, right?

194
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,509
You need to wear something
that suits the occasion.

195
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,139
- Where are you going?
- Hongdae.

196
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,090
Cheers.

197
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,360
- How is it? Is it good?
- It's so good.

198
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,659
Have a bite.

199
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,230
How do I look?

200
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,899
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

201
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,299
Do I look okay?

202
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,070
One, two, three.

203
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,840
Like this.

204
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,990
These look pretty.
Let's take a picture, Mom.

205
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,990
Let's put these on
and go on a trip, Mom.

206
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,860
That sounds great.

207
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,210
You're so adorable.

208
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,279
- Do you like them?
- Yes.

209
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,850
If Dad were here,

210
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,450
the three of us could
go around in the same sneakers.

211
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:58,889
Mom.

212
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,690
Yes?

213
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,889
What's on your mind?

214
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:04,799
Well...

215
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,000
You and I once had matching shoes
when you were still a child.

216
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,399
I was reminded of that time.

217
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,899
Really?

218
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,669
It'd be great if I could remember
great memories like that.

219
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,679
Who cares if you don't remember?
I can tell you all about it.

220
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,509
Okay.

221
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,789
My Yu Jin,
do you remember everything?

222
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,590
Why does she look so sad?

223
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,740
"St. Paul's Home?"

224
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:52,809
Are you sure?

225
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:55,779
She lived there
and got adopted at age ten.

226
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,750
That was where Yu Jin grew up.

227
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,720
Did she pick Goo Ha Na...

228
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,750
because she was Yu Jin's friend
at the children's home?

229
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,889
I heard Yu Jin's funeral was held
at that children's home, too.

230
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,929
Then, she must know
her daughter died.

231
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,000
Why would she keep it from me?

232
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:17,000
Is she really suspicious of me?

233
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,769
If she were, she would've
done something already.

234
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,269
No one seemed to be looking...

235
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,279
into the hit-and-run accident,
so relax.

236
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,309
Then, why is she hiding this from me?

237
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,549
She kept it quiet
because there was no evidence...

238
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:29,549
to lead to the culprit.

239
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:30,950
If she had evidence,

240
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,549
she would've had it investigated.

241
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,990
I cleaned up after myself.

242
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,190
Yes, she didn't say anything to me,

243
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,289
which meant she had nothing to say.

244
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:47,159
Then, I need to find out
why she chose her as a fake daughter.

245
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,070
There's the message.

246
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
I got photos of Chairwoman Shin.

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,450
They had tteokbokki,

248
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,909
took pictures,

249
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,519
and got matching shoes. That's all?

250
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,519
Wait, do they continue to act
even when they're alone?

251
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,360
It even looks like
they're having fun.

252
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,200
I'll bring some napkins.

253
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,620
It's so much fun
to be on a date with you.

254
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,019
I'm very happy, too.

255
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,789
You, me, and Eun Chong,
the three of us should go on a trip.

256
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes, let's do that.

257
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,539
Mom.

258
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,740
Goodbye.

259
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,850
Yu Jin.

260
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,980
Yu Jin.

261
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,950
Yu Jin.

262
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,519
Mom! Mom, be careful.

263
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,460
Yu Jin...

264
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,200
Me?

265
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,070
Mom.

266
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,470
Yes, Yu Jin.

267
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,710
Did you see someone you know?

268
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,049
No.

269
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,879
Mom, you don't look well.
Should we go home?

270
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,120
Yes, and tell Jin Goo to come home.

271
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,190
Okay.

272
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,659
I was so surprised
that I spent the night up.

273
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,830
To Eun Chong's aunt...

274
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,929
No, to the chairwoman's daughter,
I said something so offensive...

275
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,440
and couldn't make myself
go to sleep.

276
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,909
- It was because of you.
- Are you blaming me?

277
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,139
It's because Jin Goo
doesn't get his act together!

278
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,940
What did Jin Goo do?

279
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,409
He knew Goo Ha Na was Yu Jin
from the get-go.

280
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,649
He deceived us all.

281
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,179
What do you mean?

282
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,519
The chairwoman
told him to keep it a secret,

283
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,559
so he deceived even Se Young and me.

284
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,059
Se Young was
shocked out of her mind...

285
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,929
when she found out
Goo Ha Na was Yu Jin.

286
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,200
Both Se Young
and I felt so betrayed.

287
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,370
He kept it a secret
because the chairwoman told him to.

288
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,500
You shouldn't blame him for that.

289
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,070
But Goo Ha Na...

290
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,610
Yu Jin...

291
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,909
She's a fake.

292
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,809
She, Jin Goo, and the chairwoman are
all in this together!

293
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,820
Good grief.

294
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,220
Why are you so mad?

295
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,389
Were you mad
that she found her daughter?

296
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,930
You're home, Yeo Jin.
How was your date?

297
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,529
It was nice.

298
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,970
Did you get exhausted?
You look tired.

299
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,400
I need to get some rest.

300
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,339
You should, too, Yu Jin.

301
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,309
Okay. Get a good rest, Mom.

302
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,880
Yeo Jin, you should
remove the altar at the temple...

303
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:24,279
now that you found Yu Jin.

304
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,920
What's that?

305
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,190
She has held Buddhist ceremonies
for the last 20 years,

306
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,130
hoping you'll return safely.

307
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,529
She made an altar
and a wishing tree...

308
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,230
at the temple.

309
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,970
"A wishing tree?"

310
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,740
Let's go there and see it soon.

311
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,470
Why did you lie
about Yu Jin's death...

312
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,839
and take that brat in
as your daughter?

313
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,950
You're back, Ms. Chairwoman.

314
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,579
Yes.

315
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,390
Come here for a second.

316
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,329
I'm sorry for saying that last time.
I apologize.

317
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,940
No, it's all right.
Please don't mind it.

318
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,470
Eun Chong's aunt...

319
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,910
No, Ms. Yu Jin,
I'm not apologizing...

320
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,380
because you're
the chairwoman's daughter.

321
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,380
I felt so uneasy
after saying that to you.

322
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,049
I see.

323
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,980
You can just call me
Eun Chong's aunt.

324
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,089
But still,
you're the chairwoman's daughter.

325
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,359
And you can't tell my son...

326
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,299
that I'm working at this place.

327
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,369
It'll break his heart
if he finds out.

328
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Exactly. He cannot find out.

329
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,440
Do you feel uncomfortable
to have me around?

330
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,740
No, it's not that.

331
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:03,650
Right. He's coming here right now.

332
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,049
The chairwoman summoned him.

333
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,349
Wait, really? Wait a second.

334
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,420
- My gosh. That must be Jin Goo.
- What do we do?

335
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,119
Wait, I'll hide in the utility room,

336
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,859
- so don't say anything.
- I won't.

337
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:17,930
Goodness.

338
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,160
What do I do now?

339
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,369
It feels so different
to see you here.

340
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,069
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

341
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,740
Did something happen outside?

342
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,880
Why did she suddenly want to see me?

343
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,079
Nothing happened.
You should go inside.

344
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,519
Okay.

345
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,630
You wish to move
your daughter's remains?

346
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,529
I want her to rest
in a good place...

347
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,599
where I can see her
whenever I want to.

348
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,970
Then, should I ask Ms. Goo...

349
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,400
to move Ms. Yoon's remains
with her foster parents' remains?

350
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,210
I don't want the words to go out.

351
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,579
I'll just move
Yu Jin's remains quietly.

352
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,309
It'd have to be lost or stolen
to do it in secret.

353
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,509
But that's too dangerous.

354
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,450
We need to take another measure.

355
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,019
I'll think about it.

356
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,690
Ms. Sim must be cold out there.
I should give her this.

357
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,099
My gosh. Why are you here?

358
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,069
I don't see the helper here.

359
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,569
Why do you want to see her?

360
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,069
She went to shop for groceries.

361
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,170
It had been long since we met.

362
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,809
Let me get a cup of water.

363
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,609
You should go outside.
I'll bring it for you.

364
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,740
- I'll do it.
- No, it's okay.

365
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,349
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

366
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,089
- You should have some.
- Okay.

367
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,799
- Gosh, I need to...
- Don't sit down!

368
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,029
What?

369
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,000
Hurry up and drink it.

370
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:09,339
You should drink that and go.

371
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,380
What's wrong? Are you mad at me?

372
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,980
Yes, you need to pay
more attention to your mother.

373
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,180
I wanted to get some rest
after going out all day.

374
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,750
Did something bad happen outside?

375
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,750
- Did the chairwoman make you...
- No.

376
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,220
Nothing happened,
so you need to go now.

377
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,730
- Goodbye.
- All right. I'm leaving.

378
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,299
Gosh.

379
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,839
- Ms. Sim! Mr. Hwang left.
- Goodness.

380
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,410
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

381
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,470
Your legs must hurt.

382
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,650
Gosh, you must've been cold.

383
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,109
You should keep that on.

384
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,450
I'm fine, really. Thank you.

385
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,920
Have you always hidden like this
whenever he came?

386
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,019
If you got caught,
it'd break his heart and yours.

387
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,630
Was someone here?

388
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,660
- Mr. Hwang came by.
- Why was he...

389
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,559
Were you not caught?

390
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,529
I wasn't. That's why I'm still here.

391
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,000
- What's for dinner?
- Codfish soup.

392
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,140
I was feeling like galbi.

393
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,470
If you have some left,
pull them out and grill some.

394
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,380
I already told you
that we were done.

395
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,839
Then, why didn't you make some...

396
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
- Was it freshly caught?
- Why would I get frozen fish?

397
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,230
(Goo Ha Na)

398
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:40,630
How is Goo Ha Na
actually Yoon Yu Jin?

399
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,839
Ms. Yoon, a delivery came for you
from a department store.

400
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:55,809
Was Ha Na out of the office
until this week?

401
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:59,220
Doesn't the office feel quite empty
although only one is missing?

402
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,579
Are you all free today?

403
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,289
This office is a mess.

404
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,660
If you have time to chat,
clean up the place instead.

405
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,019
- Yes.
- Yes.

406
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,029
Ha Na was always good
at keeping things neat.

407
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
Her absence showed really quickly.

408
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:17,569
This is why people say
we'll miss them when they're gone.

409
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:21,299
What's that? Move it.

410
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,410
Those are...

411
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,940
leaflets Ms. Goo ordered,
a guide to one's health.

412
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,680
Right, Ms. Yoon. You asked me
to send some files, but I have...

413
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,849
Good grief!

414
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,250
Stop talking about Goo Ha Na!
I'm sick of hearing her name!

415
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,589
Darn it.

416
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,990
I meant that I had one missing.

417
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:43,990
She's sensitive.

418
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,359
I'll meet Mr. Han tomorrow...

419
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,200
and tell him I'll go ahead
with selling the business.

420
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,269
Yes, I'll supplement the files
and send them over.

421
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,640
Okay.

422
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,240
(Head Director's Office)

423
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,069
I must've fallen asleep.

424
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,269
I shouldn't have woken you up.
Go back to sleep.

425
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,440
I was leaving anyway.

426
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:28,970
No.

427
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,480
Did you put this over me?

428
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,250
You told me to come here
and get some rest.

429
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,049
Thanks for your help.

430
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,519
Seeing you asleep off guard
reminded me of our old days.

431
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,920
You can come by often.

432
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,390
- Bye.
- You can tell me things...

433
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,029
you can't tell Hwang Jin Goo.

434
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,130
Come by
if you need someone to talk to.

435
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,890
Let's put these on
and go on a trip, Mom.

436
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:26,599
It would've been great
if she were Yu Jin, not Ha Na.

437
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,069
Come in.

438
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,740
Mom.

439
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,410
How do you feel?

440
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,079
I'm fine.

441
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,450
I must've been tired
after going out in the cold.

442
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,849
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

443
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,319
No, I had fun, too.

444
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,750
It reminded me of our old days.

445
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,089
Mr. Hwang's mother made
this date tea.

446
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,259
I heard you had insomnia.

447
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,130
It had been a long time.

448
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:03,900
Did it first happen
after you lost me?

449
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,500
I found you,
so I should be better soon.

450
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,640
You don't have to mind me.

451
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,109
I'll find everything that's good
for insomnia and help you.

452
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,410
Thank you.

453
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,279
Right. I heard
you had low blood pressure, too.

454
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,420
People my age have
a condition or two.

455
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,150
Please don't treat me
like a patient.

456
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,720
That must be Eun Chong.

457
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,970
Eun Chong, did you have fun?

458
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,470
Auntie!

459
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,339
Eun Chong.

460
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,640
It's Ms. Bang Ul.

461
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,839
Ms. Bang Ul, I want to see Yali.

462
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,549
Hey, Eun Chong.

463
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,049
Grandma, may I go see Yali?

464
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,420
"Yali?"

465
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,319
It's a cat that Mr. Hwang keeps.

466
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,259
Eun Chong, you must like cats.

467
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,859
You can go over there next time.

468
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,259
All right! I get to see Yali.

469
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,559
Eun Chong, wash up and come down.
Let's play.

470
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,910
It smells like my grandson.

471
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,029
Yu Jin...

472
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,509
How am I going to take
her daughter's remains in secret...

473
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,779
without telling Ms. Goo?

474
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,019
- Don't sit down!
- What?

475
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:06,559
You should drink that and go.

476
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,059
Did I do something to hurt her?

477
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,000
Take this.

478
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,400
- What's this?
- It's my present.

479
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,500
Those are Verver Shoes.

480
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,539
You've heard of it, right?

481
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,470
Wait, you don't know?

482
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,480
I don't.

483
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,410
You need to know
these luxury brands.

484
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:31,380
It wasn't easy to find
those limited-edition shoes.

485
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,750
You can keep these.

486
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,319
I can't wear shoes...

487
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,150
that take a month to repair
in Italy.

488
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,589
Is she taunting me?

489
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:40,519
How many times do I have to say it?

490
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,430
You're Yoon Yu Jin, not Goo Ha Na.

491
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,500
If you keep acting that poor,

492
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,630
you'll end up tainting
Aunt Yeo Jin's reputation.

493
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,900
I said I'd help.

494
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:53,500
I can make you a different person
from head to toe.

495
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,240
I understand what you mean,

496
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,009
but I'll take my time.

497
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,369
I'll talk to Mom.

498
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,309
Are you disregarding my thoughts?

499
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:01,640
It's not that.

500
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,950
I'll just take the thought.

501
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:10,190
Fine.

502
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,789
Again, I should be patient, right?

503
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,630
All right, Eun Chong.

504
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:28,400
What? Eun Chong.
Have you seen this photo?

505
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,809
The photo of you, me,
and your mommy.

506
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:31,769
Where did the picture go?

507
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,140
It was here just now.

508
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,950
What are you doing in my room?

509
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,160
Wait, was it Yoon Se Young?

510
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,329
By any chance,
did you take a photo from my room?

511
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:57,599
What photo?

512
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,569
The one with me,
Eun Chong, and his mother.

513
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,140
Why would I take that photo?

514
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,369
- Did it go missing?
- Yes.

515
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,480
Wait, were you asking if I stole it?

516
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,950
It's not that.

517
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,220
It was here just now,
but it just disappeared.

518
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,579
I was asking because
you left those shoes in my room.

519
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,990
Yes, you are suspicious of me.

520
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,359
It's not that. It wasn't in my room,

521
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,690
so I was wondering
if you had seen it.

522
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,059
What you asked was,
"Did you take a photo?"

523
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,960
You were downright suspicious of me!

524
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,480
First, you were suspicious of me
over that Kongkong or whatever.

525
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,750
And now,
you're treating me like a thief.

526
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,650
But I should still be patient.

527
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,920
You're Yoon Yu Jin,
and I'm Yoon Se Young.

528
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:51,619
You weren't even that patient.

529
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,819
Don't you get
how patient I am with you?

530
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,460
No, I don't.

531
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,589
Unbelievable.

532
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,759
Auntie Ha Na.

533
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,400
We're just talking.

534
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,569
I never asked you to be patient.

535
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,269
You may have done that on your own,

536
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,910
- but don't patronize me.
- "Patronize?"

537
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,240
Don't be patient.
It doesn't suit you.

538
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,410
Is that all you have to say?

539
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,250
Do you really want me
not to be patient?

540
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,880
I couldn't care less
if you were patient or not.

541
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,119
- Let's go, Eun Chong.
- I'm not done talking to you!

542
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,190
Let go of me!

543
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,490
Are you okay?

544
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,789
- You're bleeding.
- You're bleeding.

545
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,829
- You're bleeding.
- What?

546
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,799
Darn it. What is this?

547
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,269
Hey. Did you just hit me?

548
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,940
Let go of me!

549
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,210
- What's with you?
- You hit me first!

550
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,480
Let go!

551
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,710
Stop hitting my auntie!

552
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,250
Stop hitting her!

553
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,549
- Let go of me!
- No, you let go!

554
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,279
Let go!

555
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,769
(Cinderella Game)

556
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,910
I'm your guardian now.

557
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,380
I'll protect you.

558
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,410
She's a fake, Yeo Jin.

559
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,349
Stop going over the line.

560
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,950
Were you sure nothing happened
between you and Ms. Goo?

561
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,549
I wanted her as my daughter-in-law.

562
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:03,619
I'm more than happy now.

563
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,460
So, you decided
to fight your sister?

564
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,720
I'll think of everything
after my revenge is over.

565
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,690
Can you keep everything I say
a secret?

566
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,089
Why are you telling me this?

567
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,160
Did Goo Ha Na rub you the wrong way?

568
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,700
Don't come.

569
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,869
This is my home.
