(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,680
(Episode 87)

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,520
Yeo Jin, remember?

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,190
When we first met,

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,090
we hit it off right away.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,330
We talked all night, not realizing
time passed by so quickly.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,500
You were so endearing
when you talked...

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,910
with your sweet voice.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,580
Can you get up...

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,550
and call my name just once?

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,560
I'm sorry for everything.

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,330
What...

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,500
are you doing right now, Mr. Han?

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,640
Ji Seok.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,250
Was it true...

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,220
that you were...

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,990
Chairwoman Shin's husband?

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,360
Was it?

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,570
Let's talk outside.

22
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,720
Ji Seok.

23
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,800
I can't believe it.

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,700
Just tell me it wasn't true.

25
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,870
Tell me that it was a lie.

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,940
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,950
How can you be
Chairwoman Shin's husband?

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,290
How can the helper of my revenge be
my enemy's husband?

29
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,630
Do you have any idea
how much trust I had in you?

30
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,730
You were like
a father figure to me...

31
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,480
If you're the husband
of the enemy who killed my parents,

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,610
that makes you my enemy, too.

33
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,810
You're just like
my parents' murderer!

34
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,220
Why did you help me?

35
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,490
Why did you take things this far...

36
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,190
and deceive me to help
take Chairwoman Shin down? Why?

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,230
You and I had the same idea.

38
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,730
Did you want your revenge
on Chairwoman Shin, too?

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,630
Did you use me as your tool?

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,370
I genuinely wanted to help you
get your revenge,

41
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,510
and it was my calling.

42
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,880
"Genuine? Calling?"

43
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,950
Forget that kind of nonsense!

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,250
What else did you lie about?

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,490
Were you happy...

46
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,920
living as Eun Chong's grandfather...

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,690
when you deceived my siblings
and moved into Ha Na's place?

48
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,530
That was why you told me
to stop trying to get revenge.

49
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,570
You wanted to protect
your grandson. Isn't that so?

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,810
You're a worse hypocrite
and crueler than Chairwoman Shin.

51
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,480
I saw you...

52
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,680
when you were begging the chairwoman
by the factory 13 years ago.

53
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,860
Then, fate led me
to reunite with you...

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,290
in a faraway country, in America.

55
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,190
I took that...

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,230
as my calling to save you.

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,900
I also wanted to atone for my wife,
who had been destroying the weak...

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,610
through her
corporate raiding schemes.

59
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,480
I wanted to save you.

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,050
The only thing
I could do to do that...

61
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,780
was to give you hope that
you can get your revenge on her.

62
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,550
It may sound like an excuse,

63
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,290
but would you have
accepted my help...

64
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,730
if I told you who my wife was?

65
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,360
Would you have agreed to see me?

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,600
In that case,
you might have died five years ago.

67
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,070
You should've just left me to die.

68
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,010
Then, I wouldn't have felt...

69
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,620
as miserable as I did.

70
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,090
I thought of you as my own.

71
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,720
When you trusted me and admired me,

72
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,560
I really thought of you as my son.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,730
You thought of me as your son?

74
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,770
Don't make me laugh.

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,540
You took advantage of me...

76
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,010
to keep your petty conscience,

77
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,240
hoping to be freed
of that false sense of guilt.

78
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,580
Yes.

79
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,750
That might have been the case.

80
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,160
I truly apologize for deceiving you.

81
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,230
Did I actually get revenge?

82
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,000
How is my revenge significant
in any way?

83
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,300
What am I supposed to do now?

84
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,140
How am I supposed to go on?

85
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,410
Ji Seok.

86
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,850
Will you please forgive me?

87
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,190
- I want us to continue to...
- No.

88
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,160
No.

89
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,460
I'm completely shattered.

90
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,100
I never want to see you again.

91
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,650
Ji Seok.

92
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,630
Hello? I'm at the hospital.

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,370
The chairwoman is
in critical condition.

94
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

95
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,600
I'll be there right now.

96
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
Yeo Jin!

97
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,420
She still does not have a pulse.

98
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,950
Her blood oxygen level fell
under 60 percent.

99
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,120
Get the defibrillator.

100
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,190
Yes, Doctor.

101
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,960
She fell into cardiac arrest.

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,930
Yeo Jin, please.

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Her pulse is back.

104
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,900
Is she okay?

105
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,570
Yes, thankfully,
her heart began to beat again.

106
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,310
We'll keep an eye on her
and update you on her condition.

107
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,240
Okay.

108
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,550
Thank you.

109
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,950
Yeo Jin...

110
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,690
- You're here.
- Hello.

111
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,190
My goodness. How can this happen?

112
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,400
- Mr. Han.
- Grandpa.

113
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,040
Hey, Eun Chong.

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,070
What brings you here, Mr. Han?

115
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm sorry for not telling you
until this day.

116
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,350
Not telling me what?

117
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,750
He seems like
the chairwoman's husband.

118
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,420
"The chairwoman's husband?"

119
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,820
Yes, I'm Du Na's dad.

120
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,830
You're Du Na's dad?

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,300
Does Ji Seok know?

122
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,840
I wanted to save you.

123
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,810
The only thing
I could do to do that...

124
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,590
was to give you hope that
you can get your revenge on her.

125
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,200
Hey!

126
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,500
Hey, are you okay?

127
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,730
Can you hear me?

128
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,310
Have some.

129
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,050
Thank you.

130
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,190
Were you really
trying to kill yourself?

131
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,930
I can't even die as I wish.

132
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,430
You should've left me to die.

133
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,530
If you hold that much grudge,
you should live instead of dying.

134
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,300
I wasn't trying to take a peek,

135
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,700
but I saw that you had
lots of files on Hyesung Group.

136
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,940
Let me know if you need my help.

137
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,550
I saved your life,

138
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,950
so I should help you live on.

139
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
(Ha Na)

140
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,090
- The person you have reached...
- He won't pick up?

141
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,000
No. He must be somewhere
getting a drink.

142
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,560
He'll want to be alone.

143
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,530
Don't be too anxious.

144
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm sure.

145
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,670
How can this happen?

146
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,310
Auntie, is Grandpa Beard
my real grandpa?

147
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,680
Yes, you're right.

148
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,450
He's your mommy's dad.

149
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,460
Does this mean
I found both my grandma and grandpa?

150
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,460
Yes.

151
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
No way.

152
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,460
- Good for you, Eun Chong.
- Yes.

153
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,930
So, why is Grandma sick?

154
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,000
She's getting a rest
after working too much until now.

155
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,270
She'll get up
after she gets a good sleep.

156
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,410
When?

157
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,310
You should
pray for her quick recovery.

158
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,910
Yes, if you pray hard,

159
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
she'll wake up very quickly.

160
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,750
I'll pray every single day.

161
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,190
Honey.

162
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,100
Did I do...

163
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
both you and Ji Seok wrong?

164
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,470
Did the things I did
to atone for my sins...

165
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,040
only end up hurting you two?

166
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,420
She had a cardiac arrest?

167
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,320
Is she in bad condition?

168
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,630
What are the chances
of her waking up?

169
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes, all right.

170
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,410
Your aunt had a cardiac arrest.

171
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,740
I don't think she'll make it.

172
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,110
Shouldn't you go there
and check on her condition?

173
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,810
What if she suddenly wakes up?

174
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,310
I'll take over her hospital room.

175
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,550
It makes me shudder to think about
how I got kicked out yesterday.

176
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,990
Who does he think he is
to kick me out?

177
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,960
Tell me about it.
Do you have a plan?

178
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,590
I kept the divorce paper
to use in times like these.

179
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,300
I felt so sore all around
trying to rack my brains for once.

180
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,140
This feels much better.

181
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,910
My gosh!

182
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,680
Darn it. I didn't order any food.
What do you want?

183
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,150
Wait, that was a massage chair?

184
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,290
These days, what looks pretty
performs the best, too,

185
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,390
- just like me.
- That's not important right now.

186
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,430
I saw Ha Na and Eun Chong together
while delivering food.

187
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,430
What? Darn it.

188
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't let Ha Na do this.

189
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,200
Yes, let's have
a serious talk with her.

190
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,470
Lead the way. We're going home.

191
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,770
Okay.

192
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,510
Hey, you told me to lead the way.

193
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,110
Yes, right.

194
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,420
Did you have fun with Eun Chong?

195
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,920
My gosh.

196
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,720
How can you do this?

197
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,920
You already know
why our parents passed away.

198
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,560
How can you want to see him?

199
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,530
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

200
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,300
That means you'll see him again.

201
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Ha Na, will it be us or Eun Chong?
Make your choice.

202
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,470
Wait, are you choosing Eun Chong?

203
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,310
- No.
- Then, what?

204
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,940
Chairwoman Shin...

205
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,780
fell unconscious.

206
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,050
What are you talking about?
She's unconscious?

207
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,790
- Stop lying.
- I'm not lying.

208
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,760
That was why I took Eun Chong
to the hospital.

209
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,430
Are you serious?

210
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,500
Ji Seok.

211
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,670
Have a seat here.

212
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,580
Jeez.

213
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,050
You didn't pick up your phone.

214
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,090
Were you drinking alone?

215
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,590
I heard about Mr. Han.

216
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,400
I wasn't as shocked as you,
but I was still surprised.

217
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,900
He was Eun Chong's grandfather?

218
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,440
He's also our new landlord.

219
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,870
That was why we didn't have to move.

220
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,640
I was so mad and dumbfounded, too.

221
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,180
How can he hide something like that?

222
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,550
I'll tell him to leave right away.

223
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,590
He'll go back to the chairwoman's place
or something.

224
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,290
Ha Na.

225
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,800
Do you think...

226
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,530
my revenge had any significance?

227
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,140
Of course, it did.

228
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,110
You awoke the chairwoman.

229
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,440
And you paid her back a little
for our parents' unjust death,

230
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,210
though not completely.

231
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,550
"A little?"

232
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,050
I got revenge on my enemy...

233
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,920
with my enemy's help.

234
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,430
What am I doing?

235
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,900
It wasn't your fault.

236
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,370
You didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,240
Sometimes, fate throws things
that are out of our control.

238
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,380
I heard you tried
to take your own life in America,

239
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,610
and Mr. Han saved you at that time.

240
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,420
I say that's more than enough.

241
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,420
I'm sure our parents will
think the same way.

242
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,520
He saved you.

243
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,230
What more could Mom and Dad want?

244
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,060
I don't know...

245
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,630
what to do.

246
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,640
Everything is such a mess.

247
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,510
It all feels like a nightmare.

248
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,920
It's okay.

249
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,670
Hold your head up as you go to work.

250
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,240
And put this on.

251
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,250
What? I really wanted this.

252
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,820
It works perfectly with my skin.

253
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,500
- How do I look?
- You look radiant.

254
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,670
Is it because that's made of caviar?

255
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,040
Do not lose heart
even when you're at work.

256
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,000
I'll hold my head up high
and walk into her hospital room.

257
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,940
Will Uncle Sung Ho let you in?

258
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,780
Yes, that should be enough...

259
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,980
to crush his spirit.

260
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,880
So, they had that kind of story
back in America.

261
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,720
It sounds like fate.

262
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,190
If you put it like that,
I guess it seems so.

263
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,220
I think time will take care of them.

264
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,690
They seem to have
a father-son relationship.

265
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,830
Actually, I'm a bit jealous.

266
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,430
Can you tell me
about your father later?

267
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,800
My dad?

268
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,470
I have a lot to share
from down memory lane.

269
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,010
Then, let's make a bet
on how many memories we can share.

270
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,210
I know I'll win.

271
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,250
Me, too.

272
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,090
Let me share a secret.

273
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,320
"A secret?"

274
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,460
Do I have to be nervous?

275
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,830
It's about the disappearance
of Eun Chong's mom.

276
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,570
Oh, that.

277
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,000
Tell me.

278
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,370
I lived in Seongbuk Port
when I was ten.

279
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,110
- Did you?
- I ran into two girls from Seoul...

280
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,480
at the port on the day before
we met at the hospital.

281
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,480
And were the girls
Se Young and Eun Chong's mom?

282
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,880
Probably.

283
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,750
I saw one girl's face.

284
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,220
A few days ago, I ran into Du Na,
who had lost her memories.

285
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,160
If you're correct,

286
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,760
the one you saw back then
must be Se Young.

287
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes.

288
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,270
But that isn't evidence to prove
she's involved in the disappearance.

289
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,940
I do want to check with her, though.

290
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,840
I don't think
she'll give you an answer,

291
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,340
but you should still ask.

292
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,020
- Ms. Yoon, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

293
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,720
Of course.
I just did as my superior told me.

294
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,330
Your superior?
Which one of your superiors?

295
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,030
Do I have to state the obvious?

296
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,730
- Right. Chairwoman Shin.
- Chairwoman Shin.

297
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,300
You've reached Hyesung Hotel,
Travel Service Department.

298
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,470
All right.

299
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,450
Ms. Yoon, you're wanted
at the investigation room again.

300
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,850
Again?

301
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,150
What will you use this time
to get me involved?

302
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,150
You framed Chairwoman Shin
for your embezzlement.

303
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,220
Is that how you take advantage
of her unconsciousness?

304
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,220
Your family is so cold-hearted.

305
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,190
We didn't take advantage of her.
It's the most reasonable way.

306
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,560
"Reasonable?"

307
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,270
Then, let's unravel this
in the most reasonable way, too.

308
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,940
You know
where Seongbuk Port is, right?

309
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,740
That was random.

310
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,540
I lived there when I was young.

311
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,910
I got sent back to the home,
then met Du Na there.

312
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,020
So what? Did you call me here
to share your pathetic history?

313
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,950
But I had met Du Na
at Seongbuk Port...

314
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,660
before we met
at the children's home,

315
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,090
and you.

316
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,230
What are you talking about?

317
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,000
We never met.

318
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
I gave you a hand
when you got off the boat.

319
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,670
Don't you remember?

320
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,880
Du Na and you both got on the boat
when her hat flew away.

321
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,510
But why were you the only one
who got off?

322
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,050
Never mind if you don't remember.

323
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,620
Why do you care
if I remember it or not?

324
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,390
What does that have to do
with Yu Jin's disappearance?

325
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,990
Are you making up a story...

326
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,070
where I came up with a plan
to let her disappear?

327
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,230
This isn't funny.

328
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,870
- Is it not?
- No.

329
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,110
And you seeing me or whatever
can't be used as evidence.

330
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,410
What does that have to do with work?
Why did you call me here?

331
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,950
This isn't your playground.

332
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,890
Seeing you there
can't be used as evidence.

333
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,030
But I find you more suspicious
after you snapped.

334
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,640
She helped me get off the boat?

335
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,410
Be careful. It's slippery here.

336
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,410
Are you all right?

337
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,220
That girl was Ha Na?

338
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,290
You can't come in.

339
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,690
- Please leave.
- Who do you think you are?

340
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,160
I stayed by her side until this day.

341
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,470
You can't suddenly come and act like
her husband after all these years.

342
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,910
Think of why she had kept this.

343
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,980
She tried to divorce you.

344
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,040
Look.

345
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,550
(Divorce by Mutual Consent,
Yoon Sung Ho, Shin Yeo Jin)

346
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,480
(Divorce by Mutual Consent,
Yoon Sung Ho, Shin Yeo Jin)

347
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,160
You left her all alone
while she was in distress...

348
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,230
in her empty house after she lost
her daughter and her husband left.

349
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,400
It's ridiculous to see you
act like her husband now.

350
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,130
You played a part in that.

351
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,700
What did you say?

352
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,340
We would've found Yu Jin
if you didn't get in our way.

353
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,640
Then, I wouldn't have had to be away
from home for all those years.

354
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,580
What do you mean
I played a part in that?

355
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,750
You stayed by her side
until this day.

356
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,220
So, I'll be a husband from now on.

357
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,890
Wait, are you doing this...

358
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,590
to inherit her assets
when she passes away?

359
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,130
Do you think you can take back...

360
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,300
the life you abandoned 20 years ago?

361
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,670
Yeo Jin...

362
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,310
and I lived much longer together
than with you.

363
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,910
Why should I listen to you?

364
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,410
I'm Yu Jin's dad
and Yeo Jin's husband.

365
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,110
Is that so?

366
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,790
Then, let's call someone
at this hospital...

367
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,890
and see which one of us is
her real family.

368
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,860
She spent 20 years
apart from you, her husband,

369
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,660
but we lived every single day
of the last 20 years as a family.

370
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,230
Which one of us is her real family?

371
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,900
Both you and I don't share
a drop of blood with her anyway.

372
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,540
I was always there for her
whenever she needed me.

373
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,240
Where were you when she was...

374
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,480
in the darkest
and most painful place?

375
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,510
Her husband?

376
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,750
What makes me worse than you?

377
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,820
You only have your name on paper
as her husband!

378
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,720
Move aside. I have to see her.

379
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,630
You can't go in.

380
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,590
Sir.

381
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,700
Good. Ms. Jang, you tell him.

382
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,530
Between me and Sung Ho,

383
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,540
who's closer to Yeo Jin?

384
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,810
Sir.

385
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,920
They've located Detective Cho.

386
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,890
Good. Where is he?

387
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,390
I'll go.

388
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,790
The hired hands will
find him and bring him here.

389
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,230
Please stay with the chairwoman.

390
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,960
Myung Ji is acting recklessly.

391
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,300
Yes, it's also suspicious
that the video file...

392
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,730
for the CCTV in front of her place
got deleted.

393
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,940
I asked the house across
to find the footage,

394
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,840
so we'd find out soon enough.

395
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,580
Yes, we should
heighten the security.

396
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,850
Yeo Jin.

397
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm here.

398
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,990
Yeo Jin.

399
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,900
Do you think...

400
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,300
I killed Yu Jin or not?

401
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,210
So, why did you find that notebook?

402
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,820
You caused Yu Jin's
hit-and-run accident and killed her!

403
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,220
Everything is in here!

404
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,020
You're over.

405
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,970
Yeo Jin.

406
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,700
It's time for you to join Yu Jin...

407
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,310
before you face anything worse.

408
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,620
- It's me, Myung Ji.
- Where are you?

409
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,860
I'm getting chased right now.

410
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,660
I told you to go to New Zealand.
Why didn't you do that?

411
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,630
Leave the country now.
Find a ship to stow away.

412
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,830
Myung Ji,
can you send me some money?

413
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,140
Lay low.

414
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,140
And send me the list
of Yeo Jin's assets first.

415
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,110
My friend will reach out
and have it delivered to you.

416
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,850
Ha Na said she saw me
at Seongbuk Port.

417
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,160
How did she see you?

418
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,760
She lived there...

419
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,460
until she was sent back
to the children's home.

420
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,000
Nothing would change
even if she saw you.

421
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,770
I don't know.
She doesn't have evidence,

422
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,100
but I know she's suspicious
of you and me, Mom.

423
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,500
There's nothing to be suspicious of.

424
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,840
She wouldn't know
I instigated the hit-and-run accident.

425
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,240
Bye.

426
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,020
You came to work.

427
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,780
I thought you'd take a leave.

428
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,990
Why should I?

429
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,620
The sponsor
who helped you get your revenge...

430
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,560
turned out to be her husband.
That would've broken you.

431
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,860
Your revenge is over,
but it probably doesn't seem like it.

432
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
So, you should continue.

433
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,970
This time, take down
both my aunt and uncle.

434
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,240
Do you...

435
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,240
still get nightmares?

436
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,310
What nightmares?

437
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,080
I always held you in my arms...

438
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,110
whenever you had those dreams.

439
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,280
Don't you remember
everything you told me in my arms?

440
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,690
- What did I say?
- Words you kept quiet for 20 years.

441
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,090
That was what you said.

442
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,300
No, it looks like
you're the one having nightmares.

443
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,960
All right.

444
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,640
How much did I tell him?

445
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,170
How much does he remember?

446
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,450
Real estate assets...

447
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,790
and everything in her bank.

448
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,320
(Transfer of Ownership)

449
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,730
(Trustee: Goo Ha Na)

450
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,190
What?

451
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,530
(Trustee: Lee Eun Chong)

452
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,870
(Original Book of Trust,
Trustee: Lee Eun Chong)

453
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,300
She entrusted everything...

454
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,810
to Lee Eun Chong
and the Goo siblings?

455
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,150
When did she do this?

456
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,090
"Entrusted on March 1st, 2025?"

457
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,490
She didn't leave a penny...

458
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,630
to me or Se Young?

459
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,510
I will...

460
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,510
end that woman's life.

461
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,690
The doctor wants to see
Ms. Shin's guardian.

462
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,890
Sure.

463
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,630
Ms. Jang,
can you come to her hospital room?

464
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,390
How can you do this to me?

465
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,190
I served you for 20 years,
yet you didn't leave me a penny.

466
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,360
Well, you leave me no choice.

467
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,340
I must take your grandson,

468
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,270
whom you love so dearly.

469
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,680
So, it's time for you to go.

470
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,020
You'd be better off
by your beloved daughter's side...

471
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,820
than being stuck here
on the hospital bed.

472
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,290
But you know,

473
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,190
we've been through
thick and thin together,

474
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,560
so let me help you take
that one last breath.

475
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,220
You brought this upon yourself.

476
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,660
Farewell.

477
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
(Cinderella Game)

478
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,970
They probably found out
it was me by now.

479
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,900
She had a cardiac arrest.

480
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,900
I honestly can't trust you,
Myung Ji.

481
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,340
Her respirator had come off.

482
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,510
How did that come off?

483
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,210
I'll be fine if there's no evidence
that I was in her hospital room.

484
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,910
I saw you at the hospital yesterday.

485
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,610
So what if you saw me?

486
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,950
Mr. Han was arrested
without a warrant.

487
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,750
There was a witness.

488
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,150
I'm getting framed.

489
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,990
Go ahead and try to stop me.
I won't let anyone stand in my way.
