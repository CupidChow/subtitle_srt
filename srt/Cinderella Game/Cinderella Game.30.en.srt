1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,009
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,439
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,139
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:08,179
You can find your mother.

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,810
Have you ever looked
for your biological mother?

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,849
Do you want to look for her?

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,390
The mother who gave you birth.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,870
I don't even know who my mother is.

9
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,799
How and where
are you going to find her?

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,439
What do you think you know about me
to offer to find her?

11
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,240
Are you ridiculing me right now?

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,020
- So, do you want to find her?
- No.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,890
Not at all.

14
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,469
Are you all right?

15
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,539
Yes.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,409
Gosh, that man just took off.

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,950
I hope it's not broken.

18
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,180
It's fine as long as you're okay.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,549
Stop minding me and go.

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,090
Why do you care
if the heater is broken or I'm hurt?

21
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,290
Mind your own business.
You're irritating me.

22
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,930
Do you think I want to mind you?

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,530
You keep getting on my mind...

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,430
and making me feel concerned.

25
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,739
You're always suffering
like everyone's punching bag,

26
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:40,609
letting people walk all over you.
How can I turn a blind eye to that?

27
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,670
Is that my fault?

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,739
Turn your gaze away and pretend
like you don't hear anything...

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,109
no matter what others say to me.

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,950
Just treat me like I'm invisible.
Please!

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,280
I can't do that!

32
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,450
Do you pity me?

33
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,260
- Because I'm an orphan?
- How can you say that?

34
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,430
Do you pity me
because I don't have a mom...

35
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,129
who'll fight against Ms. Yoon's mom
after getting beaten up by her?

36
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,030
If that isn't the case,
why do you suddenly bring her up?

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,000
Did I ever say I wanted to find
my biological mother?

38
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,740
I don't know what she looks like
or what her name is.

39
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,939
I never even thought about
my birth mother to this day.

40
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,039
Who do you think you are to ask
if I want to find her?

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,780
No, I...

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,289
Do you not want to find her?
Not at all?

43
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,319
No, I don't.

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,729
I do not.

45
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,430
Why does he care if I get hurt...

46
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,599
or if I find my mom?

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,080
You look hurt.

48
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,250
Where's your mommy?

49
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:08,960
What's wrong?

50
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,729
It looks hurt. Where's its mommy?

51
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,270
Let's take you to a doctor.

52
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,729
The inflammation looks severe
all over its lungs.

53
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,930
It'd need to be hospitalized
for about a week.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
Would it be all right
after treatment?

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,469
Of course.

56
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,169
What do you want to call her?
She's a girl.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,699
You should name her.

58
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,740
- Yali?
- "Yali?"

59
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,210
I like it.

60
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,620
Yali.

61
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,080
And the guardian's name?

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,189
- Goo Na Ha.
- Hwang Jin Goo.

63
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,319
- Please. Yes.
- No, you can do it.

64
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,560
- It's okay.
- Goodness.

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,659
I'll go with Ms. Goo.

66
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,659
- All right.
- All right.

67
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,670
Hang in there a little more, Yali.

68
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:28,310
It didn't seem like
she had been weaned off.

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,639
How did she end up losing her mommy?

70
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,110
I wonder.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
She'll be fine after treatment,
so don't worry too much.

72
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,519
Ha Na, why are you so late?

73
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:44,720
Why are you here again?

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,629
Goodbye.

75
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,060
Okay. Goodbye.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,459
You're still out of your mind.

77
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,370
Why were you with him again
after what Yoon Se Young...

78
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,569
and her mom did?

79
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,740
Is something going on?

80
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,079
No, nothing.

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,310
A strong negation equals
a strong affirmation.

82
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,709
You're suspicious.

83
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,480
Don't settle
with Yoon Se Young's mom,

84
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,250
even if she kneels and begs you.

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,720
- I already did.
- What?

86
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,230
You took the compensation, right?

87
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,060
- How much did you get?
- I didn't take it.

88
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,199
You're insane.

89
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,329
Why did you settle the case
without any compensation?

90
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,930
Did you really do something wrong?

91
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,430
Is something going on
between you and Hwang...

92
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,139
So, why didn't you take the money?

93
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,439
Then, how will you save
Ji Seok's face?

94
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,990
Yes, I'm home.

95
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
She settled?

96
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,569
The chairwoman initiated
a lunch meeting with Ms. Goo...

97
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,529
and Ms. Yoon's mother.

98
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,769
It seemed like she was persuaded
or coerced into settling the case.

99
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,009
What was her term?

100
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,639
It was to appoint Ms. Yoon
to the hotel instead,

101
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,209
and she'd be working
right under you.

102
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,120
Are you sure
you'll be fine working with Ji Seok?

103
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,379
I can't avoid him forever.

104
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,160
It's a great chance to find out
what he's up to.

105
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,129
You finally sound like my daughter.

106
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,399
Make sure you find out about
his relationship with Richard Han...

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,899
and what his motivation is...

108
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,300
in joining our business.

109
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,240
Why do you think I'm here?

110
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,870
To get my revenge on you?

111
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,269
It's more like the opposite.

112
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,579
How dare he ban me
from entering the building?

113
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,810
Me, the next chairwoman
of Hyesung Group?

114
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,819
What? You won't let me be
the chairwoman?

115
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,449
Of course,
you're the next chairwoman.

116
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,589
Anyway, why were you at work?

117
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,290
Right. I thought
she took the files to work...

118
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,430
from that safe.

119
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,370
I wanted to take a photo
of the safe in her office.

120
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll find a chance to take one.

121
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,449
I can be your friend.

122
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,199
How's my best friend?

123
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,730
Eun Chong? Yes, he's well.

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,199
It must be tough to balance
your work and raising your nephew.

125
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,470
Even working mothers
have a tough time raising their own,

126
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:48,939
and you're doing it for your nephew.

127
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,379
Eun Chong is a smart and good boy,
so it's not too hard.

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,649
He brings me lots of happiness.

129
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:01,420
I heard you had been looking
for Eun Chong's grandmother.

130
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,720
Yes.

131
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:06,160
But I don't have enough leads,
so it's not too easy.

132
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,230
Do you have some leads?

133
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,060
My friend remembered
a few fragments of memories...

134
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,800
before she passed away.

135
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,329
Such as?

136
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,269
She remembered a wooden swing,

137
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,839
a fireplace, hot chocolate,
and marshmallow.

138
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,339
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

139
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,879
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

140
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,990
Did she mention anything
about her parents?

141
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,659
No, we hoped she'd remember
something about her parents,

142
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,789
but she suddenly passed away.

143
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,759
Wooden swing, fireplace,

144
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,000
hot chocolate, and marshmallow.

145
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,470
Be careful. Watch your clothes.

146
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,340
All right!

147
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,259
Should I get rid of the fireplace
and the wooden swing...

148
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,759
before Goo Ha Na moved in here?

149
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,070
And my family photos.

150
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,580
How did that sick kitten
end up losing its mother?

151
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,450
What happens after you treat her?
What will you do then?

152
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,049
She should be adopted.

153
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,720
I feel bad...

154
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,990
for all humans and animals
that don't have a mother.

155
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,590
Do you pity me?

156
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,370
- Because I'm an orphan?
- How can you say that?

157
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,129
Did I ever say I wanted
to find my biological mother?

158
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,639
Do you not want to find her?
Not at all?

159
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,409
No, I don't.

160
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,809
I do not.

161
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,980
Does she really have zero intention?

162
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,250
Yoon Se Young.

163
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,389
You aren't the only one
who has a mom.

164
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,159
I have a mom too.

165
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,730
Mom!

166
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,330
She even shouted out
that she also had a mom.

167
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,639
Mr. Hwang wasn't the type
who'd talk empty.

168
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,519
I have zero information
about my mother.

169
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,220
What was he thinking
when he said he'd help me find her?

170
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:53,090
Ha Na, what's wrong
with this fan heater?

171
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,690
It's broken.

172
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,090
Did you not check it
before you picked it up?

173
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,600
- Well...
- Come on.

174
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,629
People shouldn't con each other
in the neighborhood.

175
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,169
I'll report this guy so that
they'll never get to use...

176
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,629
the secondhand marketplace again.

177
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,000
No, that's not it.

178
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,539
I dropped a perfectly good product,
so that happened.

179
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,710
Really? You should've been careful.

180
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,309
Right. I heard you settled the case.

181
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,950
Why did you do that?
You should've put her behind bars.

182
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,080
- You should leave.
- Darn it.

183
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,860
Ms. Goo Ha Na wanted to be
separated from Ms. Yoon at work...

184
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,759
as her term for the settlement.

185
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,860
It'll be hard for you two to work
in the same office when you marry.

186
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,629
Think of this
as moving up her appointment...

187
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,330
- at the hotel.
- Yes, ma'am.

188
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,500
We put an end to the assault case...

189
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,570
after Ms. Goo settled
and Mr. Goo dropped the complaint.

190
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,940
Thank you.

191
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,240
Ms. Yoon will be helpful in turning
the hotel into a global business.

192
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,779
She studied a lot in America
regarding that industry.

193
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:50,950
I look forward to it.

194
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,350
The Dubai contract
was pushed back by three months,

195
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,220
and so was the second payment...

196
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,490
of the investment.

197
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,730
The tour would proceed as planned
after three months.

198
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,529
I believe
we'll receive the investment...

199
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,730
once what you said happens.

200
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:11,340
I don't understand the logic...

201
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,600
behind postponing the investment
because of a subsidiary's contract.

202
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,009
I wish to speak to Richard Han.
When is he coming to Korea?

203
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,909
He'll be here soon.

204
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,450
He hasn't given me a date,
but I can't just wait forever.

205
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,279
Let's set a date
for a video conference.

206
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:25,919
Let's do that.

207
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,220
Will you go after Hyesung Group...

208
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,590
after you put Hyesung Tour down?

209
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,289
Make sure you report
those exact words to the chairwoman.

210
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,629
It'd be fun to discuss that
over the video call.

211
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,830
What will Richard Han say?

212
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,740
In the worst-case scenario,
the investment will fall through.

213
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,970
Then, do that.

214
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,809
You aren't in a situation
to worry about the group.

215
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,879
You lost the contract
with both Hanguk and Hyesung Hotel,

216
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,980
resulting in a stock price decline.

217
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,779
The Dubai contract
almost became your lifeline,

218
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:55,950
but that was also postponed
by three months.

219
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,379
Hyesung Tour will
switch over to deficit very soon.

220
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,919
We almost went into a deficit...

221
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,419
because of the contract
you called off.

222
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,519
We've maintained our sales,

223
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,620
so we wouldn't go into a deficit...

224
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,429
if you didn't hinder us.

225
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,490
So, it's my fault?

226
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:12,759
It's kind of confusing.

227
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,200
I thought you'd be competent
as Hyesung Group's possible successor,

228
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,940
but you had trouble
separating work and personal life,

229
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,039
and your personal life
didn't seem too clean, either.

230
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,169
I was also confused.

231
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,179
You continue to provoke
and taunt me,

232
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,649
but it doesn't seem like
it's only because of work.

233
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,350
What is it?

234
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,080
I find you fascinating.

235
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,350
I don't find you fascinating.
You aren't my type.

236
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,460
Head Director Goo, who keeps a good record
in work and personal life,

237
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:41,029
I'll keep an eye on you
and see if you maintain that.

238
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,340
The second payment
for the investment was postponed?

239
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,039
Mr. Goo was behind
the Dubai project, right?

240
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,440
The circumstances say he's the one,
but there's no evidence.

241
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,679
What great timing.

242
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,279
I'll have to keep an eye on him
as soon as I transfer to the hotel.

243
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,080
He wouldn't give us information
that easily.

244
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,720
I'll do whatever it takes
to find out.

245
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,190
Find a legal way to keep an eye
on Mr. Goo and Richard Han.

246
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,860
Let's make him cut his own throat.

247
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,490
That sounds fun.

248
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,929
- When is my transfer?
- Next week.

249
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,399
Ms. Yoon, you were summoned
by Head Director Goo.

250
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:25,639
Have a seat.

251
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,110
I called you because you'd start
at the hotel next week.

252
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,379
Yes.

253
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,850
It's your first time at the hotel,
so get used to the basics first.

254
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,549
Secretary Jung will
give you the files.

255
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,789
I plan to use our overseas investors
when it comes to marketing.

256
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,490
If you give me their information...

257
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,690
- Who gave you that idea?
- I came up with it.

258
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,889
You just have to do the tasks
as I tell you.

259
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,460
You don't know what I'll demand.
Why do you want the investors' file?

260
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,559
Tell me whatever you need.

261
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,669
- I'll do anything if it's for work.
- "Anything?"

262
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,240
Did you decide to side with me
instead of Hwang Jin Goo?

263
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,870
Don't be so clingy.
It's not appealing.

264
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,309
You were behind the Dubai project.

265
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,580
Did you think you'd win
by tampering with the investment?

266
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,779
I already won.

267
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,549
If you want to win,
bring evidence instead of feeling me out.

268
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,620
It's not too appealing
when you're clingy with your words.

269
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,860
So, you'll do anything
if it's for work?

270
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,029
Yes, I like that attitude.

271
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,360
I look forward to everything.

272
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,330
Sure. I do, too.

273
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,039
You don't have a lot of stuff.

274
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,450
Here. Those are the rules
for our cohabitation.

275
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,450
Put it up on the wall
and read it morning and night.

276
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,059
All right. Did Eun Chong write this?

277
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,120
I did.

278
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,389
The format
doesn't take away the meaning.

279
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,490
- Sorry?
- Well, it's not the handwriting.

280
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,000
You have to read the rules.

281
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,470
Yes, I see.

282
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,600
Also, there's a bit of draft
in this room,

283
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,269
so I put a fan heater here.

284
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,440
The one who was here before you said
hot air was your skin's worst enemy,

285
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,940
so she always refused to use one.

286
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,549
But you were a bit older,

287
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,049
so I thought the coldness could
make you fall out of your health.

288
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,820
It was my special gesture.

289
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,990
This may look broken,

290
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,120
but it still works fine.

291
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,190
Thank you. I'll put it to good use.

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,429
Please ask me anything
if you have any questions.

293
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,029
- Please relax as you unpack.
- Okay.

294
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,970
Excuse me.

295
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,340
He's a bright young man.

296
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,610
Ms. Goo, have you revised
your theme?

297
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,309
Yes, what if we take the photos
they take during this trip...

298
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:51,679
and turn them
into their younger selves?

299
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,490
The daughter back to her childhood,
and the mother back to her youth.

300
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,090
It'll lower the bar for those...

301
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,460
who don't have photos
from childhood.

302
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,620
Is that possible?

303
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,529
Have you asked the photo crew
for advice?

304
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:05,200
Yes, they can do that
by using AI technology.

305
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,900
I want to run a sample test
after the president's approval.

306
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,970
Gosh, I love the idea.

307
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:14,269
How many times have you traveled
with your mom after you grew up?

308
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,609
Often, right?

309
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,809
No, never.

310
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,779
Why not?
You seemed like a good daughter.

311
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
Did you propose
the mother-daughter therapy tour,

312
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,210
although you've never traveled
with your mom?

313
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,680
This is a fraud.
Isn't that so, Ms. Yoon?

314
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,920
You all didn't know?

315
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,359
Ms. Goo...

316
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,730
You all should be
more interested in your colleague.

317
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,259
What's wrong?

318
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,960
Did I do something?

319
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,130
No, you didn't.

320
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,369
My mother passed away
when I was in high school.

321
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

322
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,069
It's okay.

323
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,269
I'm not the only one
who doesn't have a mom in this world.

324
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:53,180
I imagined I still had my mom
while I put this proposal together.

325
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,809
I had fun thinking...

326
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,480
how it would've been great
to do these things with her...

327
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
if she were still here.

328
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,950
Yes, your mother's absence could
make you become more innovative.

329
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,720
Keep up the good work, Ms. Goo.

330
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,559
It's Mr. Hwang.

331
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,099
You can get back to work.

332
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,299
We'll cancel the contract
if we do not have guests from Dubai...

333
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,269
even after three months.

334
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,339
Our investment is at stake,

335
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,039
so we're also in a bit of a hurry.

336
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,910
I'll contact you immediately
if anything changes.

337
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,750
Goodbye.

338
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,019
It's a tour
for mothers and daughters.

339
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,160
Can you send me
a tea lesson recommendation?

340
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:43,589
Goodbye.

341
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,829
Ms. Goo.

342
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

343
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,309
Will you continue to avoid me?

344
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,940
Do you want me to transfer you
if you feel that uncomfortable?

345
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:02,480
I didn't avoid you on purpose.

346
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:06,049
I wanted to focus on work
without anything else on my mind.

347
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,289
The mother-daughter therapy tour
is my first project,

348
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,519
so I want to do a good job.

349
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,759
I imagined I still had my mom
while I put this proposal together.

350
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,789
I had fun thinking...

351
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,799
how it would've been great
to do these things with her...

352
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,829
if she were still here.

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,400
- Is there a problem?
- No.

354
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,970
I'm sorry for yesterday.

355
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,809
You were misunderstood
and beaten because of me.

356
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,779
I felt bad because it seemed like
you had to handle every trouble,

357
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,579
so I ended up crossing the line.

358
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,650
It's all right.
I also got overly emotional.

359
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,619
- Excuse me.
- Ms. Goo.

360
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:43,890
Yes?

361
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,319
I'm not sure
if what I'm doing is right.

362
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,359
But I'd rather do this myself
than make someone else do it.

363
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,460
Ms. Goo, if I can help
with your happiness...

364
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,299
by keeping this secret forever,

365
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,130
then I'll do that.

366
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,299
Please speak.

367
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,569
Do you know
about the DNA registration program?

368
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
It's something that families
with missing persons do.

369
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,640
Have you ever done that?

370
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,640
- No.
- You look for Eun Chong's grandma,

371
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,210
but why won't you look
for your biological mother?

372
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,490
It seems like
you're doing this out of pity.

373
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,289
But my foster parents are
my only parents.

374
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,230
I've never thought of my real mom
over the 30 years of my life,

375
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:29,369
and I never imagined I'd meet her.

376
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,640
I don't even care
if she's alive or dead.

377
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,509
What if
you start considering it now?

378
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,410
Why do you suddenly ask?

379
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,039
Someone is...

380
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,509
looking for you.

381
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,250
Who?

382
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,519
Her foster parents
passed away in a car accident?

383
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,250
Yes, it was handled
as a simple traffic accident.

384
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,859
Then, their business began to fail,
and in the end, it went bankrupt.

385
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,930
- What was the business called?
- Youngshin Distribution.

386
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,359
Any connections with my business?

387
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,599
Who's looking for me?

388
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,369
Someone who may be
your biological mother.

389
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,539
Stop joking.

390
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,049
Who would joke around
about something like this?

391
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,710
Who is this person?

392
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,150
I'll tell you
after you receive a DNA test.

393
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,420
No, tell me now.

394
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,460
To be honest,
I don't get what you mean.

395
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,059
I don't know who my real mom is,
so how do you know her?

396
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:31,029
Everything is
just a speculation for now.

397
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,829
It must be true.

398
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,200
Why do you speculate
that she's my birth mother?

399
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,710
You should hear it from her.

400
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:46,480
Do you have memories before seven,
before the children's home?

401
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,910
No.

402
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,109
You were too young,

403
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,549
so you couldn't rely
just on your memories.

404
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,019
That's why she wants
to take a DNA test.

405
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,920
She could be your biological mother.

406
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,819
Then, I'll meet her first.
We'll talk face to face.

407
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,990
After you take the test.

408
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,329
You said I could be her daughter.

409
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,559
Then, I'll meet her
right away and...

410
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,529
Does she not want to meet me?

411
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,710
- It's not that.
- If she wanted a parentage test,

412
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,809
she shouldn't have hidden behind you
and asked me to do it.

413
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,509
She should've come to me
and asked me herself.

414
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,980
If she isn't that desperate,
she probably isn't my mom.

415
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,920
It was quite random of you
to mention my biological mother.

416
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:30,089
I'll pretend I never heard this.

417
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,460
- What if she is?
- I doubt it.

418
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,690
I lived a perfectly good life
without knowing...

419
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,299
who my biological mom was.

420
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,869
I'll just continue to live this way.

421
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,069
Do you...

422
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,740
- resent your mother?
- I can't do that...

423
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,539
because I don't feel anything
about her.

424
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:53,839
Please excuse me.

425
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,309
Are you sure you won't regret it?

426
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,000
Is there really
something going on between them?

427
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,809
Ji Seok.

428
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,339
Is something going on
between you and Mr. Hwang?

429
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,680
- What?
- Is there something...

430
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,279
between you two,
just as the rumors say?

431
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,650
Nothing is going on.

432
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,849
Then, what happened just now?

433
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,119
Why would the president
have such a serious discussion...

434
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,319
with an employee?

435
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,960
It was about work.

436
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,589
Bye.

437
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,069
She won't do the DNA test? Why not?

438
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,000
She thought you should meet her
if you were her daughter...

439
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,440
instead of hiding behind me
and demanding that she take a test.

440
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,009
She must've been hurt.

441
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,809
I was too rash.

442
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,250
She must've been disconcerted
because this was the first time.

443
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,279
Even animals know
who their mothers are.

444
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,049
Of course, she missed
the mother who gave her birth.

445
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,019
I also want to see Eun Chong
very badly.

446
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,059
How did you end up telling her
about her biological mother?

447
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,829
I also hoped
Ms. Goo could have a mother.

448
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,970
Someone who could take her side
for the rest of her life.

449
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,509
I thought you could be
a mother like that.

450
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,809
Then, have you made your decision?

451
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,650
Yes, I'll take over the process
of turning Ms. Goo...

452
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,819
into your daughter.

453
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,720
I know it won't be easy
and that it'll be dangerous.

454
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,160
Thank you, Jin Goo.

455
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,390
However, I do have one term.

456
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,660
Please keep her safe
no matter what the situation is.

457
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,839
Promise me that
you won't hurt her in any way.

458
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,500
Yes, I promise.

459
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,839
What can I begin with?

460
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,180
Bring the file in.

461
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,680
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

462
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,420
This file contains
basic information on Ms. Goo.

463
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,859
Her files in the children's home
were destroyed in a fire,

464
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,460
so I'm missing information
from her childhood.

465
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,200
The file includes
her identification, education,

466
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,500
work history,
and files regarding her career.

467
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,910
Your sister
must've been through a lot.

468
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,849
My heart breaks
whenever I think about her trouble.

469
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,650
I'm sure my sister...

470
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,849
would've won the grand slam
if suffering were a sports event.

471
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,420
She practically raised me,

472
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,089
and she raised him
since when he was one.

473
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,089
Gosh.

474
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,029
Uncle Ji Chang, are you crying?

475
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,700
I'm not crying!

476
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,829
Everything will return to her
as blessings.

477
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,670
Of course.
If you agree, make a toast.

478
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,109
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

479
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,779
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Hey.

480
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:17,509
Hello.

481
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,579
- Did the move-in go all right?
- Yes.

482
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,720
You haven't had dinner, right?
Please join us.

483
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,750
He treated us
to celebrate his move-in.

484
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,819
You didn't have to.

485
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,359
Thank you.

486
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,160
- Did you eat a lot, Eun Chong?
- Yes.

487
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,599
You should eat, too, Auntie.

488
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,700
Thank you.

489
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,569
Thank you for the food.

490
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,569
How can this happen
all in one person's life?

491
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,609
She went to the children's home
at age seven.

492
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,849
She went through
multiple adoptions and dissolutions.

493
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,519
Then, she was adopted
by Goo Ji Seok's family at ten.

494
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,720
Her foster parents
passed away when she was 18.

495
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,420
After that,
she became the breadwinner.

496
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,990
And now, she's a foster mom.

497
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,029
It's heartbreaking.

498
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,829
The chairwoman will become someone
for her to rely on from now on.

499
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,200
I hope so.

500
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,269
You said her age was the problem.

501
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:17,740
It's not just her age.
Ms. Goo's father passed away,

502
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,240
but Mr. Yoon simply left home.

503
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,380
She doesn't have any memories
before age seven.

504
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,150
What if we said
her memories were distorted...

505
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,190
and made her believe
the chairwoman's memories...

506
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,220
as the truth?

507
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,329
Memories from that age
tend to be inaccurate,

508
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,700
so she won't be suspicious
even if her memories are distorted.

509
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,329
Can you revise the age
in the news articles...

510
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,900
- regarding Yu Jin's disappearance?
- Yes.

511
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,109
Right. You said the information
she knew about her daughter...

512
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,680
- could be a problem, too.
- Yes.

513
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,650
We must destroy the fireplace...

514
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,349
and the wooden swing.

515
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,990
And all family pictures...

516
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,319
except for the ones
from her infancy.

517
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,190
Mom. Dad.

518
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,000
I wanted to pretend like
I never heard that.

519
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,529
But the words "birth mother"...

520
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,839
seem to be stuck in my head
like leeches and won't let go.

521
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,240
But how did she know about me?

522
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,309
How does she know the president?

523
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:38,250
Hello. How's your room?

524
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,390
Let me know anytime
if you need anything.

525
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,230
Everything is wonderful,
thanks to your consideration.

526
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,730
How shall I address you?

527
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,470
You can call me Ha Na.

528
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,470
Ha Na.

529
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,440
- Should we sit for a moment?
- Sure.

530
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,480
Our place is a bit rowdy, isn't it?

531
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,079
It's like a real family home.
I like it.

532
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,680
I missed something like this
after living alone for a long time.

533
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,349
I also heard about Eun Chong...

534
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,089
and that you've been
looking for his grandmother.

535
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:13,690
Yes.

536
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,829
You're young enough
to be my daughter,

537
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,259
but I want to show you my respect.

538
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,559
My brother must've said
so many things.

539
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:25,569
You look for Eun Chong's grandma,

540
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,509
but why won't you look
for your biological mother?

541
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,049
Is something troubling you?

542
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,380
Well, no.

543
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,019
May I ask about your family?

544
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,460
I had a family.

545
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,259
But she has gone away to a place
where I can't see her anymore.

546
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,730
And there's someone
I can't meet even if I want to.

547
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,700
It looks like
there's someone you want to meet.

548
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,839
Why don't you pluck up your courage?

549
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,039
I should do that
if I didn't want to leave regrets.

550
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,839
But there are many things
I need to figure out first.

551
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,880
But I believe in the saying that
everything is meant to be.

552
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,180
It comforts me to know
that those who must meet...

553
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,750
will end up meeting one day.

554
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,289
I like that saying, too.

555
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,259
It doesn't apply just to romance.
I think everything is like that.

556
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,099
It looks like
we speak the same language.

557
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,460
We do.

558
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,900
(Job Application, Name: Goo Ha Na)

559
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,170
She dropped out of high school
and took the GED exam.

560
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,640
Then, she studied alone,
passed the international tour guide test,

561
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:37,910
and got a job at a travel agency.

562
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,549
She never took a day off
from her late teens until this day.

563
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,559
Ms. Goo,
what do you have inside you?

564
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,230
What gave you the strength
to hold out to this day...

565
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,140
without anyone to rely on?

566
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:15,950
A hundred and fifty dollars?

567
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:17,509
Where do you think you're going?

568
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,519
A hundred and fifty dollars is
almost my day's wage.

569
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,549
You're also responsible,
so please pay half the fine.

570
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,349
I'm really sorry.

571
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,859
So, please correct
just the news article.

572
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:28,190
I'm the breadwinner of my family,
so I must make money.

573
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,890
She was like family.

574
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,000
Eun Chong had no one in his life,

575
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,859
so naturally, I decided to take him.

576
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,569
My family is what charges my energy.

577
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,970
When I'm with my siblings
and Eun Chong,

578
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,170
I feel full at heart,
even though we're broke...

579
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,410
and don't own a home.

580
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,539
When I was younger,

581
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,740
I always felt empty here,

582
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,880
like the wind blew
through a hole here.

583
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,549
If anyone finds out she isn't
the chairwoman's real daughter,

584
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,049
everyone will be miserable.

585
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,589
It doesn't leave out anyone.
Every single one.

586
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,890
I can't let anyone find out.

587
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,450
Ms. Goo.

588
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,210
Please be happy.

589
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,819
I'll do my best...

590
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,349
to let it happen.

591
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,289
You...

592
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,789
surely deserve...

593
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,630
to be happy.

594
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,279
(Cinderella Game)

595
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,680
Can you find out more
about Richard Han?

596
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,549
He sent his woman as a spy.

597
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:35,549
Have you heard anything
about Goo Ji Seok in America?

598
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,990
Would my life change in any way...

599
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:39,789
if I met my real mom now?

600
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,190
You should meet Ms. Goo first.

601
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,559
Please consider Eun Chong.

602
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,059
What are you up to, Yeo Jin?

603
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,329
You must deceive her smoothly.

604
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,230
She would want to meet me right now
if she were my mom.

605
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,869
I truly wish to help you.

606
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,029
Who is she?

607
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,940
Is she someone I know?
