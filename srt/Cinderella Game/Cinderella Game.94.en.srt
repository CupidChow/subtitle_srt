1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,210
Yeo Jin.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,390
Why don't we
all go out for dinner...

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,270
By mistake?

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,600
Got justice?

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,770
Rest in peace?

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,700
How can you say such things?

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,640
Everything is over? What's over?

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,880
You already know how Yu Jin died!

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,620
Yeo Jin, do you...

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,720
Yes, I know what you did
seven years ago...

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,420
on the day Yu Jin died.
I remember it all.

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,660
It was all written in that notebook!

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,330
Yeo Jin, what are you talking about?

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,540
What notebook?

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,370
The one you took from me
after shoving me onto the stairs.

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,770
My gosh. I didn't push you.

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,240
Yeo Jin, are you sure
you saw it in real life?

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,780
Maybe you saw it
in your dream, and...

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,560
- Yeo Jin.
- What was that sound?

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,530
My grandma and Little Grandma
must've gotten into a fight.

24
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,900
Everything you say is a lie.

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,640
It was all in that notebook.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,040
Every single thing you did
from 20 years ago until now.

27
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,240
I remember everything.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,780
How dare you try to play dumb?

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,980
What did I ever do, Yeo Jin?

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,480
Don't you know?

31
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,650
All right. Let's wait and see
how long you can feign ignorance.

32
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,690
Did anyone else see the notebook
other than you?

33
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,030
I don't think
you're in your right mind...

34
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,860
after you fell unconscious
and suffered from amnesia.

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,770
Who's going to believe you?

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,870
- You evil...
- No!

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,710
You may get away with it this time,
but that won't happen again.

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,240
I'll cuff your wrists...

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,980
and shut you up behind bars!

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,680
I'll make sure you never get out
while you're alive.

41
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,050
So, admit to your crimes
in your own words.

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,790
I haven't done anything.
What am I supposed to admit to?

43
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,730
All I did...

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,860
for the last 20 years was
to stay by your side...

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,560
You deceived me
for the last 20 years!

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,370
You knew about Yu Jin's children's home,
address in America,

47
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,300
and even contact information
for her foster parents,

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,600
yet you deceived me.

49
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,870
You tampered with our DNA sample...

50
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,210
and tried to stop us
from finding her.

51
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,180
And even when Yu Jin
came to my place,

52
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,980
you instigated
that hit-and-run accident to...

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,820
How do you call yourself human? How?

54
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,090
You shoved me and put me in a coma,
then took me off the respirator.

55
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,560
It's terrible to even speak of.

56
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,700
Do you have evidence I did that?

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,570
You lived your life in luxury
under my roof with my money...

58
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,840
and then went on to betray me.

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,910
Do you want evidence?
I'm the evidence!

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,910
Then, how spotless
and ethical are you?

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,150
You were the one
who killed Ha Na's parents.

62
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,850
- How are you so different from me?
- Shut your mouth!

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,730
So? Are you
going to report me or what?

64
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,230
What can you do without evidence?

65
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,760
Wait and see what I can do.

66
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,330
I said I'd kill your daughter.

67
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,300
Your daughter will die
in worse pain than Yu Jin.

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,070
Are you scared
of seeing your kid get hurt...

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,140
because someone like you
also calls yourself a mom?

70
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,080
So, you need to suffer, too.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,510
Find out how tormenting...

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,520
and painful that is.

73
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,880
Don't you dare
lay a hand on Se Young.

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,090
You already know what I mean,
so I won't elaborate.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,990
- Get out. Get out of my house now!
- If you want to tell me to leave,

76
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,300
you and I must
settle the account first.

77
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,070
I want my portion for
tending to your needs in this house...

78
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,770
for the last 20 years.

79
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,510
- What?
- You're worth hundreds of millions.

80
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,540
How can you not leave
even a penny...

81
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,880
to Se Young and me?

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,550
Are Se Young and I...

83
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,420
not as important
as the Goo siblings?

84
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,690
You killed Yu Jin.

85
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,130
You should be grateful
that I didn't take your life now.

86
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,830
You're worse than a beast.

87
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,030
How dare you demand money?

88
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,370
Get out. Get out of here now!

89
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,270
The driver who killed her is
behind bars right now.

90
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,770
Why do you keep saying I killed her?

91
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,640
Get out. Get out of here!

92
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,610
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Get out!

93
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,350
Let go of me. Come on!

94
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,050
Why are you going upstairs?

95
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,820
I need to take my things!

96
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,850
Nothing in this home is yours
other than your body.

97
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,760
- Leave as you are.
- Good grief!

98
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,990
- Get her, Ms. Jang.
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,530
Do not lay a finger on me.

100
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,760
Yeo Jin,
will you really be like this?

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Stop talking like we're so close.

102
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,600
Get out of here on your own
before I drag you out.

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,340
Let go of me. Let go.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,670
Leave before I make you
take these clothes off.

105
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,570
Let go of me. Let go!

106
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,280
Let go!

107
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,380
How dare she kick me out
empty-handed?

108
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,690
She must be dying
to find the notebook.

109
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,830
Should I put it somewhere else?

110
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,180
Did something happen?

111
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,650
The hit-and-run case was wrapped up
as inexperienced driving.

112
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,120
- Have you heard?
- Yes.

113
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,450
The culprit sided
with Choi Myung Ji until the end.

114
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,490
But there's one piece
of evidence left.

115
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,790
We'll find the notebook.

116
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,730
Yes, I'll hold her responsible
for everything she did...

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,230
and make her spend
the rest of her life behind bars.

118
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,570
She told Eun Chong
it was a relief...

119
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,270
the culprit for his mom's accident
was caught,

120
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,980
and that his mom would be
resting in peace now.

121
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,080
I couldn't contain my anger
as soon as I heard that.

122
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,820
I really don't get her
as a fellow human.

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,430
What is it?

124
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,730
You must hate me
and dread me very much.

125
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,900
I was wondering
how you were still here with me.

126
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,740
Well, we both want
to catch Choi Myung Ji...

127
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,970
and bring justice to Du Na's death.

128
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,710
And it's important
to Eun Chong, too.

129
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,650
That's all I want to help you with.

130
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,880
Thank you.

131
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,650
Will you take a seat?

132
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,520
Yes.

133
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,400
I kept thinking of your face
even when I didn't have my memories.

134
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,000
I wondered why I thought of you
more than Yu Jin or Eun Chong.

135
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,680
Yu Jin and I were
in a mother-daughter relationship,

136
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,710
but it must've been destined to last
only for a decade.

137
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,250
You and I didn't spend as much time,

138
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,420
but you must've made
a significant impression on me,

139
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,060
as if a decade of time
had packed into that period.

140
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,860
I must have
inexplicable feelings for you,

141
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,030
things I can't express...

142
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,700
in simple gratitude or apology.

143
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,500
If I may get another chance,

144
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,510
I want to make a proper apology
to your siblings, too.

145
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,050
I'll try to make it happen.

146
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,250
I'm still tracking those
who carried out your parents' accident.

147
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,720
Even if I fail to find them,

148
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,220
I'll still pay for what I did.

149
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm glad...

150
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,130
I got this chance
to be honest with my sins...

151
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,240
and to ask for forgiveness
once again.

152
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,810
If I had passed away
without waking up,

153
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,980
I couldn't have rested in peace.

154
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,420
Auntie Ha Na. Grandma.

155
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,550
Hey, Eun Chong.

156
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,650
- You must've been surprised.
- Yes.

157
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,360
Why did you fight
with Little Grandma?

158
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,960
She did something really wrong.

159
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,530
What did she do?

160
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,770
She took your mommy away.

161
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,270
Eun Chong, your grandma
remembers everything now.

162
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,640
- Really?
- Yes.

163
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,350
The hit-and-run case was closed,
but don't be disheartened.

164
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,220
Let's find evidence and request
a reinvestigation for the instigator.

165
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,690
We should.

166
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,560
What about the employee
at the safe company?

167
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,990
Adamant.
But I'll continue with persuasion.

168
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,660
Have you not found
Detective Cho's location?

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,300
His phone is turned off.

170
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,800
He must be contacting Myung Ji
with a different phone.

171
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,210
Her phone is hack-proof,
so it's not easy to get in.

172
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,780
The case was closed,
so she might meet Detective Cho soon.

173
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,980
Yes, and she might contact
the culprit, too.

174
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,820
Why don't we put tails
on both of them?

175
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,950
Let's do that.

176
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,520
I heard you kicked Myung Ji out.

177
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,420
I couldn't contain myself
when I saw how happy she was...

178
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,930
about how the culprit was found.

179
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,030
I'm glad you did that.
It was long overdue.

180
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,770
I finally feel relieved.

181
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,170
Yes.

182
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,120
You look much prettier
than in your power trip video...

183
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,720
and the failed wedding video.

184
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,890
Those videos
raked in a lot of views.

185
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,130
I was the hottest news back then
as the nastiest woman.

186
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,300
You're pretty,
so who cares if you're nasty?

187
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,070
I get irritated when I see
ugly girls act nasty.

188
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,540
I only see two things in women.

189
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,780
She must be pretty and young.

190
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,450
I'm not young. I'm 32.

191
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,820
With your looks, age 32?

192
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,580
Not a problem.

193
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,020
- What do you see in men?
- Money.

194
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,530
I came because I heard
you were rich and reckless.

195
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,060
We make a perfect match.

196
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,130
- Do you like animals?
- No.

197
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,730
I have a cat allergy, too.

198
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,670
- But not a dog allergy.
- Sure.

199
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,910
It's Ms. Yoon.

200
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,010
- Is there anything you don't eat?
- I don't know.

201
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,240
I can eat everything.

202
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,050
I hear the second son of Jeongil is
the most reckless party boy.

203
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,050
A rich and reckless party boy.

204
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,790
I don't know.

205
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,860
I guess I like looking at paintings.

206
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,200
It hasn't been long since she was
dumped at her wedding...

207
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,770
for faking her pregnancy,
and she's already on a blind date.

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,440
She must be in a rush.

209
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,380
All she sees in men is money.
Nothing else.

210
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,310
I liked that simple answer.

211
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,520
She wouldn't care...

212
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,380
even if I had another wife or two.

213
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,050
Yes.

214
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,560
Why are you there?
Did you fight with Aunt Yeo Jin?

215
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,570
I had tea, then left.

216
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,470
I'll talk to you there. Bye.

217
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,080
Were you on a blind date?

218
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,450
- Yes.
- Why are you seeing these randos?

219
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,360
Everyone is once a rando.

220
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,630
Even if I pick and choose,
men are all the same.

221
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,230
So? Will you marry him?

222
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,270
I'm only here
because my mom asked me.

223
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,300
Marry him? As if.

224
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,170
You said you wouldn't listen to her.

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,500
- Make sure you look forward.
- Okay.

226
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,210
Gosh, how cute.

227
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,450
Should we keep a dog, too?

228
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,650
Yes.

229
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,500
Let me know if your leg hurts.

230
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,400
No, I'm fine.

231
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,800
You've lied down already,
so take a nap.

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,670
You made me want to take one now.

233
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,040
Take a nap.

234
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,610
Let me pick your lice out.

235
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,050
We don't live
in that day and age anymore.

236
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,750
I did that pretty often
while I lived in a children's home.

237
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,760
Was life tough back then?

238
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,430
There were many tough moments,

239
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,500
but I also made many great memories,
thanks to the amazing people I met,

240
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,270
including the reverend mother...

241
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,300
and Du Na.

242
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,610
I have a question.

243
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,540
Technically speaking,
Du Na is your enemy's daughter.

244
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,210
Why are you so passionate...

245
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,980
about exposing the truth
behind her accident?

246
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,050
You can
leave it up to the chairwoman.

247
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm just nosy.

248
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,190
I once told the chairwoman...

249
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,830
that one thing
I regretted the most in my life...

250
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,700
was meeting Du Na
and raising Eun Chong.

251
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,040
- You did?
- Back then, I meant it.

252
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,310
I had decided
never to see Eun Chong again,

253
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,880
that I would risk my life
to get revenge on her.

254
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,580
But when I separated her
from Hyesung Group,

255
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,590
I saw a weak and poor woman.

256
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,390
She lost her daughter,
was abandoned by her husband,

257
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,530
and was left all by herself
like a lone winter tree.

258
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,300
If she hadn't lost Du Na,

259
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,240
she probably wouldn't have begun
to raid corporations.

260
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,870
But apart from that,

261
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,180
Du Na was my first sister,

262
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,320
my soulmate, and Eun Chong's mom.

263
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,520
I want to bring her justice.

264
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,130
Eun Chong has the right to know
how his mother passed away.

265
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,860
I talked for too long. The end.

266
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,500
- Where did they go?
- What?

267
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,440
Your wings.

268
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,710
Gosh, that was so tacky.

269
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,980
I hid them.

270
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,750
Come on.
Close your eyes and take a nap.

271
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,600
Everyone is head over heels in love.

272
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,940
Is tteokbokki
my only partner in life?

273
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,170
Danny, I miss you.

274
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,310
Let me show you my lunch.

275
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,310
Look. It's tteokbokki.

276
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,450
Doesn't it look good?

277
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,520
Ms. Part-Timer. Eat quickly.

278
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,160
Your lunch break is over.

279
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,290
Uncle Ji Chang! Auntie Ji Eun!

280
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,490
I told you not to...

281
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,200
- Who is she?
- My English tutor.

282
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,610
Hello.

283
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,580
My name is Goo Ji Chang.
I'm Eun Chong's uncle.

284
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,750
Do you like tteokbokki?

285
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,880
I do.

286
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,130
Uncle Ji Chang,
why aren't you taking our order?

287
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,730
- Hey.
- Uncle Ji Chang.

288
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,930
- Hey, pull it together.
- What?

289
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,030
What's with this air?

290
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,340
- My gosh.
- Where is he going?

291
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,780
He's usually not like that.
What's wrong with him today?

292
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,280
Why are you here?

293
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,250
I got kicked out.

294
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,860
Did Aunt Yeo Jin
remember everything?

295
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,990
She regained her memories
before she got discharged,

296
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,830
but she kept it quiet only from us.

297
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,870
Why did she deceive us?

298
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,940
What's the reason?

299
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,440
She fell into a coma
while fighting with me.

300
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,010
Then, she should've kicked you out
from the get-go.

301
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,480
Why did she do it now
after pretending not to remember?

302
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,280
Is there another reason?

303
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,220
It's because I didn't tell her
about Yu Jin for 20 years.

304
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,850
- Is that all?
- Yes. What else could there be?

305
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,420
How was the blind date?

306
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,830
That's not the problem right now.

307
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,730
We need to find someone
who can be our reliable connection.

308
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,030
Mom. Please.

309
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,000
You should get married
when you have a chance.

310
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,500
Are we living here from now on?

311
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,570
No, we're going back soon.

312
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,880
I can't let her
kick me out like this.

313
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,780
Aunt Yeo Jin
won't open the door for you.

314
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,510
What about our stuff?

315
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,580
I got kicked out empty-handed.

316
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,750
We need our clothes and cosmetics.

317
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,430
Aunt Yeo Jin.

318
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,000
Let me apologize on my mom's behalf.

319
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,570
Can you please forgive her and me?

320
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,610
Have a seat.

321
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,810
I know what she did was wrong.

322
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,620
She's driving me crazy, too.
Why did she do that?

323
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,190
How much do you know?

324
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,890
That she hid news
about Yu Jin for 20 years.

325
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,860
And everything she did to you.

326
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,000
She's reflecting on herself, too.

327
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We'll make sure
we repent for everything.

328
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,700
Aunt Yeo Jin,
I lived here all my life.

329
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,240
I don't want to go anywhere else.

330
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,080
It's not so easy for me to face you.

331
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,680
After all,
you're Myung Ji's daughter,

332
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,150
the woman who killed my child.

333
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,550
She killed her?

334
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,090
There's evidence...

335
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,920
that your mom was
behind the hit-and-run accident.

336
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,360
It's not easy
to bring this up to you myself.

337
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,200
But your mom...

338
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
demanded evidence
and began to act shamelessly.

339
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,000
So, she left me no other choice.

340
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:09,070
Was my mom
really behind Yu Jin's accident?

341
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,940
- Yes.
- What's the evidence?

342
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,310
She kept a record in a notebook
while she tailed Yu Jin,

343
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,280
watched on her, and tracked her.

344
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,720
It's also a ledger that shows
money transactions with a detective.

345
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,950
Where's that notebook?

346
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,720
Was that the notebook
Ms. Jang had been looking for?

347
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,890
Yes, she pushed me
while trying to take that from me...

348
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,530
and then put me in a coma.

349
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,900
She'll deny it
even if you ask if it's true.

350
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,940
Will you find the notebook...

351
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,770
and send her to prison?

352
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,340
Prison is way too good for her.

353
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,510
If I can,

354
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,980
I want to torture her
in the hottest pit of fire.

355
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,160
You aren't a child anymore,
so you should make a wise decision.

356
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,660
Would it be better
for her to pay for her crimes?

357
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,760
Or should she continue doing that
and live as a criminal?

358
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,200
He liked my daughter?

359
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,070
That sounds great.

360
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,240
She liked him, too.

361
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,240
I'll give you a huge present...

362
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,880
if this marriage goes well,
Ms. Jung.

363
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,420
All right. Goodbye.

364
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,760
"Ms. Choi Myung Ji."

365
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,790
"Your loan has been approved."

366
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,530
Everything is good now.

367
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,630
We can make do
with whatever we have.

368
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,340
Did Yeo Jin think
we'd go down without her?

369
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,820
(Mom)

370
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,430
Mom was behind
the hit-and-run accident?

371
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,400
She kept a record in a notebook
while she tailed Yu Jin,

372
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,440
watched on her, and tracked her.

373
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,670
It's also a ledger that shows
money transactions with a detective.

374
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,680
Why would she tail Yu Jin,
keep eyes on her, and even kill her?

375
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,190
Only to get Hyesung Group?

376
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,290
It'd be so simple and easy
if we died on the same day.

377
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,690
No one will find out
you were the reason why we lost Yu Jin.

378
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,100
We won't get kicked out...

379
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,700
and have to live
as homeless people and fugitives.

380
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,240
I lied to Uncle Sung Ho.

381
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,470
I knew Yu Jin was on a boat,

382
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,510
but I said I didn't know.

383
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,550
You saw her get on a boat?

384
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,520
Yes. It's all my fault.

385
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,190
Wait, did she do that to Yu Jin
because of me?

386
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,790
Because Yu Jin might
remember everything if she returned?

387
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,470
No.

388
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,840
No, it can't be.

389
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,610
No.

390
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,840
I can't just believe
what my aunt said.

391
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,310
It's not like
she found the notebook.

392
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,180
I'm my mom's daughter,

393
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,520
so I must trust her.

394
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,590
I will trust her.

395
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,660
I will.

396
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,000
I told Se Young that her mom was
behind the hit-and-run accident.

397
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,570
She needed to know
who her mom really was.

398
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,240
It must've been shocking.

399
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,940
She'll have to handle it.

400
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,670
It didn't seem like
she knew about the notebook.

401
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,840
I heard she framed me
for her embezzlement, too.

402
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,580
Yes, you should
turn everything back to its place.

403
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,980
I should.

404
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,190
- Myung Ji must've made her do it.
- Yes.

405
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,030
- Hello?
- Yeo Jin.

406
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,160
I got a call from the employee
at the safe company.

407
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,500
You did? What did he say?

408
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,560
He said he'd help.

409
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,670
- Really?
- He's working the night shift,

410
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,670
so he'll meet us at 10 p.m.

411
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,340
Okay. I'll go with you.

412
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,540
The employee at the safe company
agreed to help.

413
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,410
That's wonderful news.

414
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,950
I hope the notebook is there.

415
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,390
What time is it?

416
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,930
It's 9:50 p.m.

417
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,890
Ten minutes left.

418
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,530
Do you think the notebook is there?

419
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,760
I say it's still there.

420
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,100
Me, too.

421
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,240
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

422
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,340
I don't know
why it's making me so anxious.

423
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,570
Right?

424
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,650
You should finish the dessert
and go home first.

425
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,080
I have to close the place.

426
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,620
We'll help you close.
We should go together.

427
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,020
- Let's do that, Mom.
- You two should go on a date.

428
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,320
The weather is so nice.

429
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,490
We'll do it with you
on our way home.

430
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,990
- Yes.
- Will you let me join?

431
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,230
I'd be grateful.

432
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,840
It's not here.

433
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,170
She took it out already.

434
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,550
Choi Myung Ji.

435
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,260
Yes. All right.

436
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,830
Was it not there?

437
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,960
It was empty.

438
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,430
When do you think she noticed?

439
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,370
We're back to ground zero.

440
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,810
I thought we had her.

441
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,780
(Certified Copy of Register: Land)

442
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,410
My family's fortune is
on a par with them, isn't it?

443
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,520
Yes, this should be enough
to make the Jeongil family happy.

444
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,890
His parents were reluctant
because of her failed wedding...

445
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,960
- and rumors of faking pregnancy.
- I know.

446
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:14,030
Why don't you have
a good talk with them, Ms. Jung?

447
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,730
Don't worry about it.

448
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,500
One second.

449
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,870
Yes, Branch Manager.

450
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,910
I got the text message that said
my loan was approved.

451
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,110
I was going to go
to the bank shortly...

452
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,650
What do you mean?

453
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,190
Fake documents?

454
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,460
I got her trust,

455
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,860
and the real estate property was
also registered under my name!

456
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,570
They can't approve the loan
because the documents were fake.

457
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,800
What's going on?

458
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,670
You only wanted to change the name.

459
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,240
I did that.

460
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,940
I didn't promise anything more.

461
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,040
What?

462
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,880
Did you try...

463
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,880
to con me from the start?

464
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,250
Do you know who I am?

465
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,290
Chairwoman Shin had placed
a two-factor security system...

466
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,430
on Eun Chong's trust fund
before she collapsed.

467
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,660
You were the one
who tried to con her.

468
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,440
Hey!

469
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,010
Shin Yeo Jin.

470
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,810
Did you expect I'd do this?

471
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,530
Choi Myung Ji just met
with the CEO of the trust company.

472
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,060
She must be full of spite.

473
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,200
She'll come and see me soon.

474
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,040
You can keep trying to take me down,

475
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,710
but you can never break me.

476
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,590
Reporter Kim.

477
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,590
I have something to tell you
about Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin.

478
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,800
There are
way too many safe companies.

479
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,730
There must be lots of rich people.

480
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,610
Could she have hidden it
anywhere else other than a safe?

481
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,780
What's that sound?

482
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,710
Is someone here?

483
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,560
Did you just break the door open?

484
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,630
Everything you do is ridiculous.

485
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,300
Get out. How dare you come here?

486
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,070
Those are my words.

487
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,840
You have to leave this place.

488
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,240
This is my house.

489
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,510
Your house?

490
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,250
Take a look and see
whose name is under the title.

491
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,810
What?

492
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,260
(Given to Choi Myung Ji
on April 15, 2025)

493
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,230
How did it...

494
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,830
I gave you this house?

495
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,800
Did you do this
after putting me in a coma?

496
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,370
You tried to take
Eun Chong's trust fund...

497
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,370
and this house?

498
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,440
You wanted me to die.
That was why...

499
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,310
you put me off the respirator.

500
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,010
Do you have evidence I did that?

501
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,950
Why is everyone yapping
without evidence?

502
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,850
It's not like I love this place.

503
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,250
You should be grateful...

504
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,920
that this was all you had to give
for 20 years of my service.

505
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,000
Get out of my house right now!

506
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,570
You're the one who needs to go.

507
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,070
Get out of my house right now!

508
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,230
(Cinderella Game)

509
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,470
Are you going to live
in my house from now on?

510
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,470
Are you asking me
to fire Se Young for embezzlement...

511
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,800
to let things go
according to that plan?

512
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,140
Yeo Jin, you should probably be
at Eun Chong's school right now.

513
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,840
I'm doomed if that gets exposed.

514
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,450
Ask Ji Seok for help.

515
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,620
Se Young, expose your mom
and say she's behind this.

516
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,980
That's the only way you'll live.

517
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,150
Did you really rat me out?

518
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,120
Then, did you think
I'd take the blame alone?
