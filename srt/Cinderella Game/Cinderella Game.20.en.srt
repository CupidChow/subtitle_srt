1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,349
You were my guest,
so you didn't have to do the dishes.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,019
Your sister must find you
very reliable.

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,919
You're friendly
and good with chores.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,019
Yes, I do an excellent job
with chores.

8
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:23,960
(Self-Centered)

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,199
- What?
- Where are you?

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,670
My parcel was delivered
to your place.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,769
Can you bring it to my place?

12
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,740
"Your place?" "My place?"

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,140
Stop nitpicking over the words.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,840
I need it at work tomorrow.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,039
- Fifty dollars.
- Hey.

16
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,380
Forget it, then.

17
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,880
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty dollars? Okay.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,250
Transfer the money now.

19
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,780
I'll only leave
after you send me the money.

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,119
Let's go home, Eun Chong.

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,990
I have to go
to Uncle Ji Seok's place,

22
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,390
so stay home alone for just an hour.

23
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,960
How can he stay home alone?

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,729
He can stay with me. You should go.

25
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,500
Both your mommy and daddy
passed away?

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,200
Yes.

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,709
My daddy passed away
before I was born,

28
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,010
and my mommy passed away
when I was one year old.

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,980
- And you don't have grandparents?
- No.

30
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,519
But I might be able to find
my grandma.

31
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,989
We've been looking by using my DNA.

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,730
I hope you find her with your DNA.

33
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,260
Goodness, it's such a relief
you have your auntie with you.

34
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,799
My goodness.

35
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,200
Wait, what day is it?

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,439
Tuesday.

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,010
It's recycling day.

38
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,939
Be careful. Okay.

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,849
All right.

40
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,920
This one goes here.
And this goes here.

41
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,790
My gosh.

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,730
If I sell all these, I can buy
at least a pack of gum for you.

43
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,829
Really? Let's start picking it up.

44
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,099
Okay.

45
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,400
Granny, does this work, too?

46
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,039
I'll do it.
You can just sit and watch.

47
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,319
- Hey, what's wrong with you?
- Goodness.

48
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,719
My gosh. Hey!

49
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,650
Goodness.

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,259
My gosh. Are you in pain?

51
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,530
That could've been so bad.
What do I do?

52
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,930
You punk!

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,469
My goodness, it must hurt.

54
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,000
It must hurt a lot.

55
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,270
My gosh. Are you okay?

56
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,139
I don't care if it's work hours.
You can't treat your staff like...

57
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,210
Buckle up.

58
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,280
- Hello?
- Where are you?

59
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,650
Are you still at Restaurant Mirim?

60
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,419
We just walked out.

61
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,849
Why was Hassan here?

62
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,090
- Who was that?
- Let go of me!

63
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,389
- Is Goo Ha Na next to you?
- I'll call you at home.

64
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,599
This is kidnapping!

65
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,069
Yes, it is.

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,169
So, stay still.

67
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm getting a call.

68
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,849
Right. Okay.

69
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,629
Hello?

70
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,900
The police station?

71
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,139
Yes, I am Eun Chong's guardian.
What's going on?

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,710
"Child abuse?"

73
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,139
(Police)

74
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,120
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Eun Chong.

75
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,020
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

76
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,919
Are you Lee Eun Chong's guardian?

77
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,629
- Yes.
- Who made him fetch empty bottles?

78
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,990
Goodness.

79
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,699
Mom.

80
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,529
Why are you here?

81
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,339
Did you come
after the police called you?

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,740
Hello.

83
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,449
Jin Goo, he said
I was a child abuser.

84
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:39,050
- What?
- Today is recycling day, right?

85
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,290
I saw lots of empty bottles,

86
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,819
so I wanted to sell them
and buy him a pack of gum.

87
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:48,290
Only I picked up those bottles.
How does that make me an abuser?

88
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,259
Is this self-abuse?

89
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,370
She's right.
She told me just to watch.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,069
Detective, it's a misunderstanding.

91
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:01,139
She's an acquaintance of ours.
How can this be child abuse?

92
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,439
Ha Na.

93
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,480
- Officer, did you get a call?
- Yes.

94
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,019
The child's safety is
our foremost priority.

95
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,290
And because he's a foster child,
we must confirm...

96
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,850
if he's safely cared for.

97
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,360
Okay.

98
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,389
Eun Chong, why don't we have a chat?

99
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,470
Jin Goo, I was unfairly framed.

100
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,370
Why would I abuse a child
at this age?

101
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,279
Mom, it'll be fine.

102
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,439
It's all a misunderstanding.

103
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,649
Please don't worry.

105
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,759
Ha Na! Who abused our Eun Chong?

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,459
Come out, you abuser!

107
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,089
- Where are you? Wait.
- Get out.

108
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,930
- Go.
- Why? What are you doing?

109
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,759
I need to know who this is.

110
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,769
What's wrong?

111
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,170
I need to see this jerk
to teach them a good lesson!

112
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,569
Shut your mouth.

113
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,670
You should've stayed with him
after taking him.

114
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,009
Why did you leave him alone
at the president's place?

115
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,610
Ji Eun asked me
to pick up a parcel for her.

116
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,639
And the president's mother
told me to go ahead.

117
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,149
Even so, why did you do that?
We're such a nuisance!

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,750
But I got your dress back
while I was there.

119
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,220
Aren't you glad?

120
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,160
How did you end up
at the president's place?

121
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,060
Well, I was on my way home
with Eun Chong.

122
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,100
Then, a pot of duck soup
suddenly rolled in front of me.

123
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,199
What? What are you talking about?
Say it so I can understand.

124
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,430
I'm serious.

125
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:39,569
The president's mother
dropped the duck soup on her way,

126
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,040
so the pot began to roll down.

127
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,139
A pot with duck soup?

128
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,449
You've had lots of concerns lately,
so you should eat some healthy food.

129
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:56,019
Should I ask Bang Ul
to make the duck soup again?

130
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,459
It's okay.

131
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,100
If someone
contaminated my DNA intentionally,

132
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,930
who could it be?

133
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,000
It must be crazy punk
like the one who made a scene...

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,670
at the inauguration ceremony.

135
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,310
Those who slander and curse you.

136
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,709
They couldn't have done this
without a detective's help.

137
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,379
Would it mean
they bought out the detectives, too?

138
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,250
Do you really think
we can find the perpetrator...

139
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,889
even if you request
an investigation?

140
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,389
We don't know the reason
for the contamination yet.

141
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,660
It would've cost a lot
to bribe a detective.

142
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,170
Those whose businesses were ruined
wouldn't have that kind of money.

143
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,980
Why don't I make this public?

144
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,379
That could work.

145
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,649
The investigation will speed up
if the families of missing persons...

146
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,490
come together and use the media
to drive public sentiment.

147
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,360
But Yeo Jin,
are you sure it's okay...

148
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,459
for your name to come up
in the media...

149
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,300
again and again?

150
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,069
I confirmed Eun Chong's condition,

151
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,610
and there were no signs of abuse,
both mentally and physically.

152
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,740
I already know very well...

153
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,250
that Ha Na does a great job
at bringing Eun Chong up.

154
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,050
Thanks to her, he's growing up
into a bright and healthy boy.

155
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,320
We also took a comprehensive look
into the whole story...

156
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,190
and decided the report was made
due to a misunderstanding.

157
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,259
But the child
still could've fallen in danger,

158
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,659
so please be careful
not to let this happen again.

159
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,559
Yes, thank you.

160
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:49,929
(The hopeful new police force,
serving the people with our best)

161
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,000
Please.

162
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:56,139
I'm so sorry.

163
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,179
My brother and Eun Chong became
such a huge nuisance.

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,649
It must've been tough.

165
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,549
It's all right. I'm just glad
the misunderstanding is gone.

166
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:09,720
I couldn't believe
I ended up at a police station.

167
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,559
I had a good time
looking around the police station.

168
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,429
Goodness, is that so?

169
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,029
Hey, the president's mother
faced trouble as a child abuser,

170
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,129
but you were having a good time?

171
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,200
So, why don't we go somewhere
and celebrate the release?

172
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,710
You need to take Eun Chong
and go home first.

173
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,809
No, I'll drive you home.

174
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,289
I've been wanting to ask you this.
May I do that?

175
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,529
- Sure.
- How did you end up...

176
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,590
raising your nephew?

177
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,970
My friend...

178
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,669
suddenly passed away in an accident.

179
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,070
He's your friend's son?

180
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,080
She was like family.

181
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,809
Eun Chong had no one in his life,

182
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,649
so naturally, I decided to take him.

183
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,580
How does that happen naturally?

184
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,850
You could've left him at a home
or given him up for adoption.

185
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,389
I said that like it was easy.

186
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,470
When did you start raising him?

187
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,830
When he was one.

188
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,970
You were never married,
never gave birth to a child,

189
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,870
but began to raise one first,

190
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,570
and he was your friend's son.

191
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,750
You were more amazing
than you seemed, Ms. Goo.

192
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,210
It's not that I'm amazing.

193
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,149
Well, no one seems to understand,

194
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,190
even my younger siblings.

195
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,230
Ms. Goo.

196
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,000
Ms. Goo?

197
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,370
My mom is asleep,
so skip the goodbyes.

198
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,139
Okay.

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,070
Ji Chang.

200
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,200
It must've been a tough day
in many ways.

201
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,960
I'll see you tomorrow.

202
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,000
Goodbye.

203
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,769
Thank you for your trouble.

204
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,070
It must've been tough for you, too.

205
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,710
- Excuse me.
- Ms. Goo.

206
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,710
Here.

207
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,779
Put it on the back of your hand
before you go to sleep.

208
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,419
You didn't even get first aid,
so it must sting.

209
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,259
But what a relief
that it didn't form a blister.

210
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,460
Wait.

211
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,799
Are you trying to save yourself
for the Dubai contract with this?

212
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,100
No, we'll discuss that tomorrow.

213
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,669
Okay. Goodbye.

214
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,149
What can I do
to make her feel better?

215
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,259
I'm serious.

216
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,259
The president's mother
dropped the duck soup on her way,

217
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,000
so the pot began to roll down.

218
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,940
- This is kidnapping!
- Yes, it is.

219
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,480
So, stay still.

220
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,480
Why am I suddenly thinking of that?

221
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,100
I got this gift from the chairwoman
for my good performance.

222
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,629
You aren't okay.
You burned yourself.

223
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,539
Please let my hand go.

224
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,100
This is kidnapping!

225
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,740
Yes, it is.

226
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,210
So, stay still.

227
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,149
Why am I suddenly
thinking of that moment?

228
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,690
Ta-da!

229
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,320
I thought you were
returning it to the chairwoman.

230
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,090
I don't have to.

231
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,230
I earned this with my performance,
so I'd wear it proudly from today.

232
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,559
- What are you talking about?
- You look nice, Auntie Ha Na!

233
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,269
You look nice, too, Eun Chong!

234
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:25,169
Anyway, is this too much
to wear to work?

235
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,970
I'll take this off.

236
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,820
Excuse me, I want to ask you
about the home with the wooden gate.

237
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,590
Do you mean the Goo siblings?

238
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,960
Do you know them well?

239
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,789
I don't know them well,

240
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,200
but everyone in this neighborhood
knows who they are.

241
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,299
- Why?
- Goodness.

242
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,429
Everyone feels bad for them.

243
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,970
They live by themselves
without their parents.

244
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,500
And there's a kid, too.

245
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,909
They have a kid?

246
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:05,879
Yes, the eldest girl raises
her friend's son.

247
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,009
She tried to adopt him
as a single woman,

248
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,250
but she didn't meet the conditions.

249
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,419
She should've left the kid
to the state...

250
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,289
and gone on to live her life.

251
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:19,389
But they're closer
than an actual mother and son.

252
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:22,330
At times, it felt like even his mom
couldn't treat him so well.

253
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,799
But who might you be?

254
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,799
Why were you interested
in the Goo siblings?

255
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,370
It's nothing.

256
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,039
I was just passing by,
and I liked that house.

257
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,899
Right. I see.

258
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,590
(Goo Ha Na, Hyesung Tour)

259
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,820
Wouldn't it be better
to spend time...

260
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,230
with your family and friends
instead of traveling?

261
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,159
The meal may be the same,

262
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,059
but something that tastes
just all right alone...

263
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,529
somehow tastes oddly delicious
when you share it...

264
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,100
with your family or friends.

265
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,240
You don't feel so empty anymore.

266
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,940
So, I hope you visit...

267
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,740
a nice place with people you like.

268
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,289
Huh?

269
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:39,940
I told you not to wear that.

270
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,169
What if you end up
wearing it on the same day as me?

271
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,769
How dare you wear that to work?

272
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,580
It was the chairwoman's gift
because of my great performance.

273
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,210
I'm going to wear it often
to express my gratitude.

274
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,320
So, she now knows
we got the Dubai contract because of her.

275
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,919
I'm not stopping you.

276
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,460
But don't wear it to work!

277
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,059
Get changed right away.

278
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,059
I can't work in the same office
wearing the same outfit.

279
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,660
- Why not?
- "Why not?"

280
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,200
Do you think
you've become someone like me...

281
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,900
now that we're in the same outfit,
making you excited to work?

282
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,799
That's not what I'm saying,

283
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,009
but I'm not so bothered
that I can't focus on work.

284
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,309
I'm fine with it,
so you can change if it bothers you.

285
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,549
Please excuse me.
My working hours have begun.

286
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,720
Hey!

287
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,420
Darn it!

288
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,519
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

289
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,390
Ha Na, what's the occasion?

290
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,059
Which brand is that dress from?

291
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,400
Ha Na, you look like a goddess.

292
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:43,829
Goodness, stop it.

293
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,200
Thank you for the compliments.

294
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,839
- Hello, Ms. Yoon...
- Hello, Ms. Yoon...

295
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,650
It wasn't the first time
you've seen me in this.

296
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,849
Right...

297
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,450
Ms. Goo.

298
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:02,619
I need coffee.

299
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,930
Fine, this is the last time
I make coffee for you.

300
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,230
Okay.

301
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,980
Add two spoons of cream and sugar.
Make it sweet.

302
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,339
- And not black coffee?
- I'm craving something sweet.

303
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,529
Ms. Yoon.

304
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:49,029
This is the last cup of coffee
I'm making...

305
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,099
My gosh. Hey!

306
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,900
What are you doing?

307
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,269
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

308
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,069
I spilled my coffee.

309
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,940
You should get changed.

310
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,710
So, why did you show up
in the same outfit...

311
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,019
and make me do this?

312
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,250
You should've worn it
in your neighborhood or at home.

313
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,220
Go get changed, okay?

314
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,309
I am not taking this off.

315
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,920
But I can't go around
looking like this.

316
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,190
What do I do?

317
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,859
Yes, I can use that.

318
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,740
Ha Na.

319
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,240
How's the back of your hand?

320
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,039
Yes, I put medicine on it and slept,
so it got better.

321
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,410
I'm glad.

322
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,009
Did you spill coffee on yourself?

323
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,019
- Yes.
- You spilled something hot again?

324
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,589
Were you not burned this time?

325
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,490
Thankfully, no.

326
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,220
Gosh, you're the type
who requires a lot of attention.

327
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,859
Yesterday, it was fish cake soup.
Today, it's coffee.

328
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:24,529
I didn't spill it on myself!

329
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,859
I was just standing still
on both occasions!

330
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,569
I'm sorry. I was just worried.

331
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,509
Was it something to be so mad about?

332
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,539
Let's go somewhere and talk.

333
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,549
What was that just now?

334
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,829
I don't want to see you
or be here at Hyesung Tour.

335
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,430
I'd love to quit right now,

336
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,200
but I have to make a living,
so I can't just quit.

337
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,029
I also got the job myself,
so I'd keep coming to work.

338
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,369
Of course, you should.

339
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:07,299
So, you better repay me
over a long time.

340
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,710
But nothing you do will lessen
my anger and sense of betrayal.

341
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,880
How can I repay you?

342
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,740
Tell me what you want.

343
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,579
If I do,
will you make it all happen?

344
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,579
I will.

345
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,579
- You don't know what I'll ask for.
- Anything.

346
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,220
Really?

347
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,559
Is there something going on
between Mr. Hwang and Ha Na?

348
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,960
It didn't seem like
an ordinary boss-staff relationship.

349
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,059
Ha Na kept yelling at him
while he looked flustered.

350
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,299
- It was as if they were dating.
- That's crazy.

351
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,200
What are you talking about?

352
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:42,670
Tell me.

353
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:47,380
Well, I saw the president
and Ms. Goo flirting...

354
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,480
I mean, bickering.

355
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Then, he wanted to talk to her
and took her somewhere.

356
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,950
So what?

357
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,920
Ms. Kim,
don't you know the difference...

358
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,619
between the things
you should discuss and shouldn't?

359
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,559
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,059
Ms. Goo, get changed.

361
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,660
Are you going to work all day
looking like that?

362
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,799
I think this will cover it up.

363
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,640
She looks exactly like me now.

364
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,039
Then, I'll ruin that, too.

365
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,549
Ms. Goo.

366
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,150
About the Dubai contract...

367
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,089
Ms. Yoon!

368
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,089
My gosh.

369
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,730
You can't trick me twice
the same way.

370
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,759
- Oh, no. Ms. Yoon. Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

371
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,869
What's going on, Ms. Yoon?

372
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,769
Did you spill juice on yourself?

373
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,309
But still,
why did you scream out so loudly?

374
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,740
Wait, what?

375
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,609
You two are
wearing matching outfits.

376
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,390
You've reached Hyesung Tour...

377
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,190
Yes.

378
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,259
Yes, I understand.

379
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,200
Ms. Goo,
the chairwoman wants to see you.

380
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:16,170
The chairwoman?

381
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,700
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

382
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,769
Come in.

383
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,140
Come on in.

384
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,980
You must've been surprised
that I suddenly called you.

385
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,849
You've done a lot of good work
for Hyesung Tour.

386
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,920
You deserve incentives.

387
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,789
No, I'm just grateful
to have a job here.

388
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,359
And once again,
thank you for this outfit.

389
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,730
I wanted to hear more
about the mother-daughter therapy.

390
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,730
How did you come up with that?

391
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,869
My parents passed away
when I was in high school,

392
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,910
so I have never traveled
with my mom.

393
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,650
But when I think of her
on an exhausting day,

394
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,119
she gives me energy.

395
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,150
So, I wanted to make memories...

396
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,559
of mothers and daughters
talking walks,

397
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,759
drinking tea,
and looking at the stars together.

398
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,359
It would be great to be
each other's source of energy...

399
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,970
and comfort on tiresome days.

400
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,640
That was how I came up with it.

401
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:30,640
Do you remember giving me tips
on where I should travel...

402
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,079
as someone who is lonely?

403
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,309
- Yes.
- Your words were heartwarming.

404
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,049
I want to be the first guest...

405
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,720
when the mother-daughter
therapy tour begins.

406
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,750
Of course, I'm sure...

407
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,430
you will be the first.

408
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,130
Director Goo said...

409
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,359
you went through a lot...

410
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,299
after your parents
passed away early on.

411
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,000
It was harder
for my younger siblings than me.

412
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,069
Like they say,
good days will come after rainy days.

413
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,480
It must feel reassuring to have
a younger brother like Mr. Goo.

414
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,009
Yes.

415
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,819
Was the boy I met at the department store
your sibling's son?

416
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,119
He was such a clever boy.

417
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,420
He's my friend's son.

418
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,990
Your friend's son?

419
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,099
Eun Chong's safety is
our biggest concern.

420
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,269
I can't begin a reinvestigation
only to have him...

421
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,170
- fall into danger.
- I understand what you mean.

422
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,940
If the DNA contamination
and the hit-and-run accident...

423
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:37,769
both turn out to be crimes,
the detective could've been bribed.

424
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:41,779
Then, will you postpone
informing your wife?

425
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:43,880
I'm still pondering.

426
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,650
She'll try
to take Eun Chong right away...

427
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,250
if she finds out about him.

428
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,720
Then, his existence would be exposed
in a matter of time.

429
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,289
What if you just share her death
and the existence of her grandson?

430
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,460
If she finds out
about the hit-and-run accident,

431
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,559
she'll also want to consider
the safety of her grandson first.

432
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,599
We signed the contract with Dubai...

433
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,200
under the term that
Ms. Goo would be the exclusive guide.

434
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,240
She got her job here
in return for her contribution.

435
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
She didn't pull any strings.

436
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,549
I didn't pull my strings with you
to get a job here.

437
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:21,220
It was me. I gave myself this job.

438
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,289
I need you to correct the account
and tell the team...

439
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,759
that I got the job here
because of the Dubai contract.

440
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,559
The tour schedule was put off
for three months because of them,

441
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,059
so we wouldn't lose anything.

442
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,599
We'll have guests in three months,

443
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:37,470
and we'll sign a supplementary contract
with much better terms.

444
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,069
If the contract got called off,

445
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:43,240
I could use that as an excuse
to kick her out.

446
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,440
Mr. Yoon, do you have the report
after the meeting with Mr. Goo?

447
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,539
I'm almost done.

448
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,980
Leave it on my desk.
That's all for today.

449
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,319
Ms. Yoon, come to my office.

450
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,079
Okay.

451
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:03,259
What did she say after finding out
we got the contract because of her?

452
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,359
Does she want a permanent position?
Or a raise?

453
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,500
She didn't say that.

454
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,569
She must've demanded something.

455
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,299
Does she want a better title?

456
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,470
Don't make the staff
run your personal errands,

457
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:13,940
especially Ms. Goo.

458
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,470
You're talking about her again?

459
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:18,910
I don't want Ms. Yoon
to make me run errands...

460
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,539
from now on.

461
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,349
And she needs to show basic respect
for her subordinates.

462
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,019
You need to take responsibility
and promise me that.

463
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:32,220
I know there was a feud
between you two before she started.

464
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,319
That was why I gave you some time.

465
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,789
You've done enough damage on her.

466
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,099
- You need to stop.
- Jin Goo.

467
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:40,660
She got her job here
because of her performance.

468
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,529
We were the ones who hid that.

469
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,240
It may be too late,
but you need to apologize to her.

470
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,700
- No!
- Se Young.

471
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,470
I just found myself another boss.

472
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,140
You will apologize, right?

473
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,019
Was that why you staged
the money envelope incident?

474
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,130
Goo Ha Na was the one
who staged an act.

475
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:18,440
She called it a misunderstanding
because of two envelopes.

476
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,039
But of course, I don't believe her.

477
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,839
Yet she found a way
to vindicate herself.

478
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,579
Goo Ha Na wins.

479
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:28,240
The Goo siblings are something.

480
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,950
You guys pull good tricks.

481
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,849
We aren't stupid enough
to fall into your stupid traps.

482
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,720
This is the problem
with dirt-poor kids.

483
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,549
They think they're so smart
and get very cheeky.

484
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,619
You're nothing but a fraud.

485
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,589
And you like that fraud,
so what does that make you?

486
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,500
Do you still like me now?

487
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,900
What are you going to do
right across from my house?

488
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,299
I know you're curious
but hold your horses.

489
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,109
Ms. Chairwoman, are you going home?

490
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,880
Yes, are you going out to work?

491
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,849
Yes, I have a meeting nearby.

492
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,670
Has Mr. Yoon checked his e-mail?

493
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,769
No.

494
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,539
She sent me an e-mail?

495
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,079
Excuse me. Hey.

496
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,650
What is it, Ms. Chairwoman?

497
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,029
You dropped your handkerchief.

498
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,779
- Come here.
- What will you do?

499
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,910
Hey, what are you doing?

500
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,250
- Come over here.
- Hey.

501
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,049
I'm going to jump here.

502
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,549
- Stop it!
- Okay.

503
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,420
All right. Shake it.

504
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,220
- This is yours.
- Eun Chong.

505
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,220
Grandpa is here.

506
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,130
Remember that...

507
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,599
you have a grandpa and a grandma.

508
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,259
Please wait just a little longer.

509
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,000
We'll meet soon.

510
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,539
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

511
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,009
(Read)

512
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,140
He read it.

513
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,579
Why hasn't he replied
if he read it yesterday?

514
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,819
Ms. Chairwoman.

515
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:56,529
President Hwang will visit
regarding Richard Han's video call.

516
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,730
Also,

517
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,160
this was delivered to you.

518
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,599
Who is it from?

519
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,299
I do not see the sender.

520
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,369
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

521
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,150
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

522
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:25,150
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

523
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:32,630
Your daughter passed away
six years ago.

524
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,279
It was a hit-and-run accident.

525
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,619
No.

526
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,700
Your daughter had a son.

527
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,740
"Your daughter had a son."

528
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,980
"He was one year old
at the time of her death."

529
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,279
"He's now seven."

530
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,180
Yu Jin had a son?

531
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:31,289
Yu Jin died, but she left a son?

532
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:35,960
A seven-year-old?

533
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,430
I have a grandson?

534
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,029
(Your daughter had a son.)

535
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,869
(Cinderella Game)

536
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,539
I couldn't get the kind of money
you asked for!

537
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,839
Is it because of that brat?

538
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,210
The president
also seems to adore Ha Na.

539
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,950
Maybe she has some unknown history
with the chairwoman.

540
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,509
You've also become weird
after associating with her recently.

541
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,049
You're always talking about her!

542
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,920
I trust you, Jin Goo.

543
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,619
No one can find out.

544
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:39,519
I was worried it'd reach Goo Ha Na
through Hwang Jin Goo.

545
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:42,019
- My auntie will become my mommy!
- Let go!

546
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,890
- Stop it!
- I'll find my grandma, too!

547
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,759
Are you okay, Eun Chong?

548
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:48,059
Was the chairwoman's collapse foreseen?

549
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,269
The chairwoman collapsed?
