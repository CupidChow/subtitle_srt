1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,650
I heard Mr. Goo's parents
passed away a long time ago.

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,880
Yes, they passed away
in a car accident...

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,189
when he was in high school.

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,989
I don't know
if Hyesung Group is his goal,

8
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:21,030
but there has to be something more
if he coldly cut ties with Ha Na...

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,329
- just because she's my daughter.
- Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,629
I don't understand, either.

11
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:27,329
I want more details...

12
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,230
on his parents' death.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,769
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,539
Mom, Dad. Ha Na hit... No.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,549
Our family hit the jackpot!

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,719
I can't believe
a day like this has come.

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,649
It's all thanks to Mom and Dad.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,649
Ha Na, remember the day...

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,560
when red seizure stickers were put
all over our place?

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,560
I do.

21
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:57,000
We went through so much trouble
after Mom and Dad passed away.

22
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,100
Those times cross my mind
from time to time.

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,229
My heart would race...

24
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,899
whenever creditors called
about the debt.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,140
I even began to hear the doorbell
in my sleep,

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,370
and Ji Chang would wet his bed.

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,409
Uncle Ji Chang wet his bed?

28
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,540
Yes, quite often.

29
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,209
I knew it.

30
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:19,049
Yes, we went through
so many hardships.

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,359
At times, I wasn't sure
if we'd live through it,

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,989
but everything went by.

33
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,030
Don't you think we did pretty well?

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,500
We did totally well.

35
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,569
I had no idea you were
our hidden jackpot, Ha Na.

36
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,670
Could Mom and Dad
have foreseen the future?

37
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,370
Hey, you need to throw this out.

38
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,879
- And this one! And this.
- Wait.

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,709
That's enough.

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,510
People can't change overnight.

41
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,250
You should change completely.

42
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,349
A different person.

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,450
Right. I brought some awesome items.

44
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,650
Hey, go over there.

45
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,659
- Hey, you.
- Gosh.

46
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,329
I prepared this
for a great day like today.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,260
Ta-da.

48
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,030
What's this?

49
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,740
Gosh, it's perfect for your skin.

50
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,409
Oh, my. Look how you're glowing.

51
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,280
Give me that.

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,789
My gosh. You're right.

53
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,360
It's nice.

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,889
Your beauty begins with your skin.

55
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,389
You're now the only daughter
of a rich family,

56
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,930
so you should put
caviar on your skin.

57
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,900
Use it every single day.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,430
You're no longer
Goo Ha Na, the pathetic girl,

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,969
but Yoon Yu Jin, the Cinderella.

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,939
"Yoon Yu Jin?"

61
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,810
That name still feels awkward to me.

62
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,139
Hey, don't say that.

63
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,180
I should go with you
and be your coach.

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,580
I feel so anxious
about sending you there alone.

65
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,490
All right. Look.

66
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,960
What's that?

67
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,159
Eun Chong's baby wrap,

68
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,360
Du Na's pregnancy journal,

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,800
Eun Chong's baby photos,

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,330
and letters Du Na and I exchanged.

71
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,699
My gosh. How pathetic.

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,909
It's so tacky for you to pack up
everything you have.

73
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,039
You need to leave these behind.

74
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,539
Hey, I found 50 cents.

75
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,879
It was the most valuable 50 cents
in the world,

76
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,120
the money you made for me.

77
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,449
Gosh, I'm so worried.

78
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,090
What's this tacky thing?

79
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,060
Wait!

80
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,569
(Taesarang Seongmo Hospital)

81
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,340
You can have this.

82
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,509
What is this?

83
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,110
That bracelet will
bring you good luck.

84
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,879
(My precious time
waiting for Kongkong)

85
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,110
My memories are off-limits.

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,620
When will you
get rid of your poor girl nature?

87
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,419
And you're going with a plus one.

88
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,919
Eun Chong, pack the stuff
you're going to take.

89
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,789
He got the biggest piece of cake
from all this.

90
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,000
Kongkong, Mommy's phone,

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,069
and pictures I took
with Mommy and you.

92
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,300
Yes! And my wish kite.

93
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,610
All right.

94
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,540
Did you finish making it?

95
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,110
Yes, I wrote down my wish
on the top, too.

96
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,420
"Please let our family be happy."

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
Gosh, that's a wonderful wish.

98
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,790
Grandpa's wish is the same as mine.

99
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,500
So, we're going
to fly the kite together.

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,769
Right, Grandpa?

101
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,399
Let's fly it before you move
to your bestie granny's house.

102
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,600
Okay.

103
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,110
This is the biggest problem
in the 28 years of my life.

104
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,750
Will it be fried chicken
or pork cutlet?

105
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,949
Or should I go
with tteokbokki and shabu shabu?

106
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,519
Are we eating that
for dinner tomorrow?

107
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,720
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,620
Your uncle is planning
his grand business.

109
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,290
- Wait, were you serious?
- Yes.

110
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,230
I'm a key staff member
of Hyesung Hotel's cafeteria,

111
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,529
but the cafeteria seemed too small
to contain a talent like me.

112
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,129
I wanted to use my talent...

113
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,500
and start a business
in the restaurant industry.

114
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,769
And I already have a rich investor.

115
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,339
Wait, are you
talking about the chairwoman?

116
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,040
Ha Na!
Don't call her the chairwoman!

117
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,649
You need to practice
calling her your mom...

118
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,709
until you get used to it.

119
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,420
Also, the chairwoman said
she'd support us...

120
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,980
with whatever we wanted.

121
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,220
- Then, you should accept it.
- Right, Mr. Han?

122
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,990
Write up a business proposal
and show it to me first.

123
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,790
So, I need approval
from Hyesung's heiress first...

124
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,129
before it reaches the chairwoman?

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,870
Don't get smart with me.

126
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,629
I'll start looking for ways
to study abroad.

127
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,500
Ji Seok now has no say
when he's with you, Ha Na.

128
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,610
You're the daughter of the owner.

129
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,209
Don't get wise with Ji Seok.

130
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,279
Tell him not to get wise with Ha Na.

131
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,420
Would Hyesung Tour go down
if we couldn't find evidence...

132
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,860
that he was behind it?

133
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,160
I guess so.

134
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,529
Well, Hyesung Group
won't suffer in any way...

135
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,699
just because
one travel agency is gone.

136
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,259
Why don't we use this chance...

137
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,000
to let Jin Goo
shut down the travel agency...

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,470
and come to the hotel?

139
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,709
Jin Goo needs to come and settle
while Yu Jin is still fitting in.

140
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,879
To do that, we have to find evidence
on Ji Seok and kick him out first.

141
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,410
Yes, so you need to go
in and out of his office...

142
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,879
and do some digging.

143
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,449
I'm trying to think of a way.

144
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,379
If I lose everything to Yu Jin...

145
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,220
and Jin Goo loses
everything to Ji Seok,

146
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,519
that will make me
the saddest woman in the world.

147
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,529
What if...

148
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,970
Ji Seok gets ahead of Jin Goo?

149
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,470
Why would you think that?

150
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,470
Wait, do you have feelings
for that punk again?

151
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,610
Are you crazy?

152
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,339
We need a plan B, just in case.

153
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,110
Yeo Jin wouldn't leave her business
to anyone outside the family.

154
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,980
If anything,
she'd steal what belonged to others.

155
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,189
Richard Han
shouldn't have messed with her.

156
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,560
There was a rumor
that Aunt Yeo Jin used to be...

157
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,389
a corporate raider, right?

158
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,500
- Is that true?
- What are you saying?

159
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,730
My goodness. What was that?

160
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,939
What was that?

161
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,240
Oh, my. Why did that fall?

162
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,980
What happened? Why did that...

163
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,540
It suddenly fell.

164
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,410
The nail must've corroded.

165
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,220
Please be careful.
I'll clean it right away.

166
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,290
It had been fine
for the last 20 years.

167
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,759
Why did it suddenly fall
just before Yu Jin moved in?

168
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,220
That's odd.

169
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,290
Well, Yeo Jin.
You can just replace the glass...

170
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,629
I should take a new one.
Yu Jin has grown up.

171
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,730
You're taking a family portrait
with your fake daughter?

172
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,500
It's so moving to think...

173
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,439
you'll take another family portrait
with Yu Jin, Aunt Yeo Jin.

174
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,009
Right? Are you going out on a date?

175
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,910
No, she wants to take back
Bang Ul's glove...

176
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,009
before Jin Goo notices anything.

177
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,050
Jin Goo's going to work.

178
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,720
The subcontractors' contract
cancellation made him busy.

179
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,149
Ms. Jang, you can clean that up
and go home.

180
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,559
And schedule my family portrait
with Yu Jin on the day of her move.

181
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,659
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

182
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,129
- I have something to report, ma'am.
- Come in.

183
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,700
She's going to remove
her photo with Yu Jin...

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,470
and replace it with the photo
of the fake daughter?

185
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,679
There are people tracing
corporate raids?

186
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,539
It was just a rumor for now,

187
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,250
but we should be careful
from now on.

188
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,679
Who did you hear it from?
Who's tracing this?

189
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm looking for the actual source.

190
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,419
Conduct everything quietly
for a while.

191
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,990
What kind of big surprise
is Ji Seok planning?

192
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,700
Ha Na, be ready.
I'll call you right away.

193
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,470
- If Ji Seok...
- What about him?

194
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,700
What if he asks you
to sever ties with me?

195
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,940
Auntie, I'll go out like this.

196
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,009
All right.

197
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,809
- Are you going to see the cat?
- Her name is Yali!

198
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,419
- Let's go, Auntie Ha Na.
- Okay.

199
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:48,129
Does this mean he holds
such a big grudge against Hyesung...

200
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,529
that he's even willing
to cut ties with his sister?

201
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,460
(Resume, Name: Goo Ji Seok)

202
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,799
He has shown
an odd sense of animosity...

203
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,870
against our business.

204
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,799
It's as if
the two families are enemies.

205
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,639
Yes, Ms. Jang?

206
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,919
I looked through Mr. Goo's file
and found his father's business.

207
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,950
Youngshin Distribution.

208
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,259
Can you find out if it had ties
to Hyesung 13 years ago?

209
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,789
I'll look into his parents'
car accident. Okay.

210
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,129
I'll meet you in the office soon.
Goodbye.

211
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,580
Jin Goo, are you going to work?

212
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,009
Yes.

213
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,649
Eun Chong should be here soon.

214
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,549
- I'll go out now.
- Okay.

215
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:46,950
It's cold outside.

216
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,789
You should put on
a muffler and gloves.

217
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,860
Mom, by any chance,
do you have the gloves I got you?

218
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,129
Of course. I've been using it. Why?

219
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,570
I thought I saw the same glove
at the chairwoman's place yesterday.

220
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,970
Really?

221
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:07,269
Either Myung Ji or the chairwoman
must've bought the same design.

222
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,539
- That must be him.
- Yes.

223
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,350
You're here.

224
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,080
- Hey, Eun Chong.
- Hello.

225
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,789
Come in, Eun Chong.

226
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,950
- Hello.
- Sure.

227
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,220
Eun Chong, have fun with Yali.

228
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,490
I'll be here in two hours.

229
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,490
- Okay. Bye, Auntie Ha Na.
- Bye.

230
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,960
All right.
Come and see Yali, Eun Chong.

231
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,629
Let's go.

232
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
- He seemed excited.
- He is.

233
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,000
Are you going to work
because of contract cancellations?

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,210
Well, that, too.
I have something else to do.

235
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,509
Hassan and Amira
won't pick up their phones.

236
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,980
I'll keep trying.
They'll pick up one of these days.

237
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,649
Things must be
hectic enough for you.

238
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,850
I'm sorry for making you concerned
about work, too.

239
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,649
It's all right.

240
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,750
Let me know
whenever you need my help.

241
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,389
You'll leave
the neighborhood soon, too.

242
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,019
It's a bummer as your neighbor.

243
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,629
But I'll see you at work
and at the chairwoman's...

244
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,259
I mean, at my mom's house, too.

245
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,470
Does it feel real now?

246
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,139
More than the first time.

247
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:23,080
Yes, right there. Come here.

248
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,320
Yali.

249
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,149
You're so adorable.

250
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,820
- Squeak.
- Yali.

251
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,389
- Squeak.
- Oh, my.

252
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,090
My gosh.

253
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,059
Yali is so cute.

254
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,759
I want to see her every single day.

255
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,830
Then, do you want to keep her?

256
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,899
I want to, but I'm moving soon.

257
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,100
You are? Where are you going?

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,269
My bestie granny's...
Gosh, that was a secret.

259
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,379
Your bestie granny?

260
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,710
Did you find your grandmother?

261
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,509
No, Auntie's...

262
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,620
Anyway, it's a secret.

263
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,350
You're full of secrets.

264
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
That must be Se Young.

265
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,230
Goodness. Is that you, Se Young?

266
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,360
Goodness. Come in. It must be cold.

267
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,970
- Yes, Mother.
- Hey.

268
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,100
Jin Goo went to work, right?

269
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,070
Right. I brought it.

270
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,009
He doesn't know, right?

271
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,070
He asked me, so I said I had it.

272
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,080
I had to rush out,
so I didn't know it fell out.

273
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:31,120
Why do you have a cat?

274
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,250
I'm keeping her here temporarily.

275
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,889
I'm having so much fun
taking care of her lately.

276
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,389
Have a seat. I'll bring some tea.

277
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,789
Okay.

278
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,659
Hello.

279
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,129
Who are you?

280
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,870
My name is Lee Eun Chong...

281
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,899
of Chamsae Class
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

282
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,440
Who are you, lady?

283
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,769
Don't call me lady.

284
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,039
You seem familiar.

285
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,909
I've seen you before, lady.

286
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,509
I said not to call me lady.

287
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,279
Is he your son?

288
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,250
He's my nephew.

289
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,549
Hello.

290
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:11,690
You're Guide Goo Ha Na's nephew.

291
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,789
Yes. Do you know my auntie?

292
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,470
Please sever your ties
with Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

293
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,200
I'll talk to Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

294
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,740
No, not Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

295
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,309
I need to pick up Eun Chong.

296
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,690
Things are quiet at home,
even though it's Saturday.

297
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,590
Eun Chong went to see the cat, too.

298
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,019
Yes.

299
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,330
If it's all right with you,
may I ask you to pick up Eun Chong?

300
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,169
- Why are you here?
- I came to see Yali.

301
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,870
Did your aunt tell you
to go see the cat?

302
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,799
I said I wanted to see it,
so my auntie dropped me off.

303
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,240
- Where is she?
- At home.

304
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,909
First, you take in your nephew,
and now, you picked up a stray cat?

305
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,980
You should quit your job
and be a full-time cat rescuer.

306
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,419
I took a kitten to the vet,

307
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:16,350
and they texted me photos
saying it was getting better.

308
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,419
She was that stray cat?

309
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,460
She's now taking advantage of a cat?

310
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,230
I heard your aunt
found her birth mother.

311
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,230
Have you seen her?

312
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,340
I heard she bought you clothes.

313
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,110
You need to answer
when an elder asks a question.

314
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,149
- Ms. Bang Ul!
- Hey.

315
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,279
Eun Chong, sit down
and have some hot cocoa.

316
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,090
Eun Chong loves cocoa, don't you?

317
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,019
This is for you.

318
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,289
His aunt left right away
after dropping him off.

319
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,559
I see. Okay.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,899
She's Mr. Hwang's girlfriend,
who'll marry him soon.

321
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,000
Isn't she pretty?

322
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:07,039
Auntie Ha Na is prettier.

323
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,539
Goodness, kid.

324
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,210
You have the worst taste in women.

325
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,480
Anyway, why do you live
with your aunt and not your mom?

326
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,379
Se Young.

327
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,720
My mommy is in paradise.

328
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,190
You won't be able to see Yali
once you move, Eun Chong.

329
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,289
You can play with her
all you want today.

330
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,460
Okay!

331
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,100
- Ms. Goo's family is moving?
- I guess so.

332
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,529
It's such a relief to hear
she's leaving this area.

333
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,840
Goodness, did you catch a cold?

334
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:45,580
No, I have a cat allergy.

335
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,279
My gosh. You had a cat allergy?

336
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,149
My goodness. This is bad.

337
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,750
What do we do?

338
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,019
- Mother, please excuse me.
- Goodness.

339
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,590
- Already?
- Yes.

340
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,990
My gosh.
Eun Chong, you can drink that.

341
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,230
Bye.

342
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,900
I called you here today...

343
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,799
- Drumrolls.
- Drumrolls. A surprise party?

344
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,900
Should I call Ha Na?

345
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,539
Listen up.

346
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,309
I'm not going to meet Ha Na anymore.

347
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:20,910
You two need
to cut your ties with her, too.

348
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,650
Man, you're starting
that nonsense again.

349
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,720
You keep bringing this up
time and time again.

350
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,750
Hey, what is this?
Are you starting the surprise?

351
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,920
There's a twist, right?

352
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,720
Did you call me here
to say this nonsense?

353
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,930
I knew something seemed weird
when you called me here...

354
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,259
and not Ha Na!

355
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,299
The least you can do is celebrate.
Why are you ruining this?

356
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,970
I already told Ha Na, too.
That's all.

357
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,700
What? What did you say to her?

358
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,400
That she'll live
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter,

359
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,069
and we'll live on our own.

360
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,279
And I told her
to cut ties with you two, too.

361
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,339
Have you lost your mind,
you lunatic?

362
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,609
Sit down!

363
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,349
Why did you push me?

364
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,579
How dare you do this
to your older sister?

365
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,650
Older sister, my foot!

366
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm not your younger sister!

367
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,559
Hey! Let go of me. Let go.

368
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,789
I said, let go!

369
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,660
- Let go, you punk!
- Darn it.

370
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,500
No, you grabbed my hair first!

371
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,569
- Ji Seok!
- That's enough!

372
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,269
Both of you, let go.

373
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,869
How is this family?

374
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,339
Do you all want to cut ties
with each other?

375
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,980
- Ji Seok...
- That's all you can ever say.

376
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,180
Are you dying
to cut ties with everyone you know?

377
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,920
If you want to do that,
you can do it alone.

378
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,089
No, I'm done with this family.

379
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,160
And you!

380
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,359
I'm not scared of you!

381
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,529
If you regret it much later,
it'll be too late.

382
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,359
"Regret?"
You're going to regret this.

383
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,000
You're a crazy punk.

384
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,700
Don't ever call me again.

385
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,069
Ha Na.

386
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,509
Ha Na.

387
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,579
At least tell me the reason.

388
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,519
Why do you hate
the chairwoman... No.

389
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,890
Why do you hate
my birth mother that much?

390
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,000
Yu Jin, I'll take
a family portrait with Eun Chong...

391
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,900
in your place.

392
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,069
I'm grateful and happy...

393
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:32,539
that I get to do just that.

394
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,349
Make me understand.

395
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,819
I just can't accept
that it's because of your work.

396
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,720
If you can't accept it,
then just take it in.

397
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,519
You and I already agreed
to go our way.

398
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,859
Yes, you and I said we'd do that.

399
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,190
You did?

400
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,960
You're going to live
a good life all alone?

401
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,369
Ji Seok must've harassed her
and demanded that they do that.

402
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,339
Imagine how mean he would've been
for her to make this decision.

403
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,599
I made myself clear.

404
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,940
I can live like
you and I are strangers,

405
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,880
but not Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

406
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,440
I may not be your blood sister,
which you deem as important,

407
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,980
but my siblings are
dearer to me than my own blood.

408
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:13,519
Don't mess with my siblings.

409
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,819
Ha Na...

410
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:17,789
You'd regret what you just said.

411
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,460
- What?
- Just be happy...

412
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,589
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

413
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,059
Don't let your greed
hurt my siblings.

414
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,759
How am I going to hurt them?

415
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,599
What are you talking about?

416
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,930
That's enough!

417
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,640
Ji Seok, can you explain this
so that we can understand?

418
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,410
What's all this
about regretting and hurting?

419
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,670
Is there a reason...

420
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,839
why she can't be
the chairwoman's daughter?

421
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,339
It's not like we're enemies!

422
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,680
So what if they are?

423
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,150
It's not like
she killed our parents.

424
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,920
You can't even tell me the reason.

425
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,220
I don't know what you're hiding,

426
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,019
but if you can't tell me now,

427
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,319
don't ever say anything.

428
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,559
You said you'd destroy Hyesung Tour.

429
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,660
Do you plan to pick a fight
with Hyesung Group?

430
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,559
Is that why you hate
how she's now their daughter?

431
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,930
- Yes.
- "A fight with Hyesung Group?"

432
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,640
You've gone crazy for money
and would sacrifice your family.

433
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,170
You're less than human.

434
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,279
Hey, do you love money that much?

435
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,380
Even if you do,
how can you fight your own sister?

436
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,519
You'll make Mom and Dad
wail on the other side.

437
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,920
- Shut your mouth.
- I'm free to say whatever I want!

438
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,890
Make your choice.

439
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,390
Will it be me or Ha Na?

440
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,890
I'm 100 percent on Ha Na's side.

441
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,460
Ha Na, I'm coming with you.

442
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Hey, wait right there.

443
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,299
Let go of me.

444
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,539
You can live with Ji Seok.

445
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:39,970
Don't be like this.

446
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,680
- Ji Seok.
- If you want to go, then go.

447
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,720
Why can't we all just be happy?

448
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,089
Why is everything
so messy and complicated?

449
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,329
Ha Na!

450
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:17,470
Don't you see me?

451
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,509
You had a knack for seducing people.

452
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,009
I never imagined
you'd use a cat to flirt with him.

453
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,049
I warned you, didn't I?

454
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,619
If you got involved
with Mr. Hwang again...

455
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,859
Fine, Ji Seok.
We'll cut our ties here.

456
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:32,990
Ha Na.

457
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,490
Hey, you should've tried
to stop them!

458
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,230
Why are you saying
you'll cut ties with him, too?

459
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,230
"Cut ties?"

460
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,970
Be quiet.

461
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,740
I'll call you, Ha Na.

462
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,210
My gosh. Unbelievable.

463
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,390
Even her siblings are crazy.

464
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,000
Anyway, did Ji Seok ask Goo Ha Na
to cut ties with him?

465
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,269
Why?

466
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,930
I looked up the police record.

467
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,339
Director Goo's parents were...

468
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,509
in a simple car accident
due to the negligence of the driver.

469
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,880
The company went bankrupt soon
after their death in that accident.

470
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,609
After that, the business shut down.

471
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,819
Was the operation in trouble
after their deaths?

472
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,279
Yes, that'll be the case.

473
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,950
By any chance,
have they taken out a loan...

474
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,849
from Hyesung Finance?

475
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,089
I've been looking into it.

476
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,230
It doesn't have to be a loan.
Was there another connection,

477
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,160
debt, or...

478
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,230
- A grudge?
- Yes.

479
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,369
At this point, that would be
the most convincing reason.

480
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,640
But I hope that isn't the case.

481
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,309
President Hwang
and Ms. Jang were together?

482
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,210
Yes, Zero said Ms. Jang took
some files to his office.

483
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,880
If they came out
on the weekend to do this,

484
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,410
would it be
because of contract cancellations?

485
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,880
Ms. Jang won't have to take part
in the travel agency's business.

486
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,750
Chairwoman Shin may
get suspicious of you...

487
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,589
if you cut ties with your sister
because of who her mother is.

488
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,259
She'll try to find out
if I hold a grudge against her.

489
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,329
I think they're doing
a background check on me.

490
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,329
Let's find out
how much they can find out.

491
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,640
It's flying. That's nice!

492
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,670
That's it.
Do you want to try, Eun Chong?

493
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,710
Come here.

494
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,079
Here. Now, run.

495
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,049
Grandpa,
let's make the wish together.

496
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,289
Shall we?

497
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,059
Yu Jin.

498
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,700
Ms. Goo has chosen this path.

499
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,099
Let's hope she'll be happy
with Eun Chong for a very long time.

500
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,920
Make me understand.

501
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,089
I just can't accept
that it's because of your work.

502
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:18,049
If you can't accept it,
then just take it in.

503
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:21,829
You and I already agreed
to go our way.

504
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,759
What on earth is the reason?

505
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,430
Ms. Goo.

506
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,740
Yes, Mr. Han.

507
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,140
Mr. Ji Chang said
you were all going to move,

508
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,079
and he suggested that I should, too.

509
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,079
Ji Chang got ahead of himself.

510
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,680
He'll live here, too.

511
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,319
She's my mom, but I don't want to be
indebted to her from the start.

512
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,160
"Indebted?"

513
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,430
You should accept and enjoy
whatever she can offer.

514
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,829
She already lets me do that.

515
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,769
Anyway, were you worried
about something?

516
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:06,299
I thought all my siblings...

517
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,710
would be happy
that I met my birth mother.

518
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,180
We'd no longer have to go through
the sad and awful things...

519
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,849
we had to live with
because we had no money or parents.

520
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,920
Was that why you decided
to become Yu Jin?

521
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,220
All your siblings seemed happy.
What's wrong?

522
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,990
Was Eun Chong's eldest uncle
not happy about this?

523
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,130
What's important is
how you feel about this.

524
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,960
Your siblings would end up
living their own lives.

525
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,400
You should do as you like.

526
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,769
Actually, I never imagined...

527
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,509
I'd find my birth mother.

528
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,670
Even as I looked
for Eun Chong's grandmother,

529
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,180
I never had the idea
to look for my own mom.

530
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,950
So, I didn't believe it when I heard
she had been looking for me.

531
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,420
I only believed it
after the parentage test.

532
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,690
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

533
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,259
You did the parentage test?

534
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:06,230
Yes, everyone does this
when they find their lost family.

535
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:11,269
But I never thought the chairwoman
of my workplace would be my mom.

536
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,109
Ms. Goo really believes
that she's Yu Jin.

537
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,579
Wait, did she also deceive Ms. Goo?

538
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,509
Do you feel unwell?

539
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,079
No, I'm fine.

540
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,750
Auntie Ha Na.

541
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,920
Hey. You're up, Eun Chong.

542
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,390
Please excuse me.

543
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:33,859
Hey.

544
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,960
All right.

545
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,230
Yeo Jin, what have you done?

546
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,099
Why have you deceived Ms. Goo, too?

547
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,750
Did you have to do this?

548
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,019
How far are you going to take this?

549
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,589
Will you finally stop
once I expose the truth?

550
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,000
Who's here at this hour?

551
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,099
Who is it?

552
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,839
I'm from the security company.

553
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:24,440
I saw someone suspicious
lurking around your front door.

554
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,940
Is everything all right?

555
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,309
Yes, everything is fine.

556
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,920
"Someone suspicious?"

557
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:34,619
Who was that?

558
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,920
Someone suspicious was
lurking around our place.

559
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,059
We should keep our door locked well.

560
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,759
(Incoming call)

561
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,960
Hello?

562
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:56,369
Hello?

563
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,700
It's me.

564
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,839
Sung Ho?

565
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,380
Where are you right now?

566
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:10,779
- Are you in Korea?
- Yes.

567
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,250
I want to meet you today.

568
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,049
I'm bringing Eun Chong home soon.

569
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,450
We'll talk in person.

570
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,720
Where should we meet?

571
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,200
I'll meet you
in one of my hotel rooms at 11 p.m.

572
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,410
What's important is
how you feel about this.

573
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,420
Your siblings would end up
living their own lives.

574
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:49,049
You should do as you like.

575
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,259
Eun Chong, I'm happy...

576
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:04,829
that I now have a mom
I can travel with.

577
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm happy that I can adopt you.

578
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,539
I'm happy that both Auntie Ji Eun
and Uncle Ji Chang...

579
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,279
won't have to live a tough life.

580
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,950
There are so many things
to be happy for.

581
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,390
So, why is Uncle Ji Seok doing this?

582
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,619
I am...

583
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,789
so heartbroken and hurt.

584
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:56,789
Eun Chong.

585
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:02,329
I'll meet your grandma today
and tell her everything...

586
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,799
about the ill-fated relationship
between the two families.

587
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:10,869
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

588
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:17,009
I'm sorry, Ms. Goo.

589
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,269
(Cinderella Game)

590
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:25,039
Wait, is she meeting Sung Ho?

591
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,710
- Then, I'll have a grandpa, too?
- Yes.

592
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,109
There's a possibility
her husband is back.

593
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,279
What will you do with her husband?

594
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:34,650
I'll use him as a tool
to put pressure on Chairwoman Shin.

595
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,319
What did Ha Na ever do?

596
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:40,559
Say something
if she ever did anything wrong.

597
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,019
You just have to put on a good act.

598
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,990
I'll handle everything else.

599
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,700
I hope you'll pull me in
more aggressively.

600
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Like this?
