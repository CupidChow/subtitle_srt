1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,519
It's me, Yoon Yu Jin.

2
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:08,429
- What now? - I'm Yoon Yu Jin.

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,328
Yes, you are Yoon Yu Jin.

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,709
Gosh, I forgot for a moment.

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,368
No, I shouldn't forget that.

6
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:21,378
I'm sorry for not realizing that.

7
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:25,648
Why are you suddenly doing this?

8
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,548
Can you handle the consequences?

9
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:29,319
What do I have to handle?

10
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:35,718
Are you saying that Aunt Yeo Jin may kick my mom and me out?

11
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:37,059
It may be something else.

12
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,088
Let's see who'll end up leaving.

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,429
- What? - I'm warning you.

14
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:45,728
That bracelet. Why did you think I threw it out?

15
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:47,669
I know what you're up to.

16
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,709
I knew you'd try to get him involved in your life by using that bracelet,

17
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:53,679
calling this old friendship, fate, or whatever nonsense you make up.

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,108
I don't care if you're Yoon Yu Jin. You can't do that.

19
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:02,948
Let me give you a warning, too.

20
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:06,289
Be careful with your lies.

21
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:08,789
- What lies? - Your lies to Mr. Hwang.

22
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,659
You talked this nonsense about how I was lying last time.

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,299
This again?

24
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:17,998
- So, no? - What's that lie?

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,398
Tell me.

26
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:21,998
You can't even say it.

27
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:25,969
You're seeing another man.

28
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,179
Did you think I wouldn't know?

29
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:33,349
And he works at our company, doesn't he?

30
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,189
All you ever say is nonsense.

31
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,459
Who's this guy at our workplace, then?

32
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,329
Tell me. Who is it?

33
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:49,769
You said you knew. Who is this at our company?

34
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,498
I'm not going to tell you now.

35
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:55,368
I'm going to consider whether I'll share it or not...

36
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,838
depending on what you do.

37
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,508
You're slandering me right now with complete nonsense.

38
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,909
That's considered defamation by using false information.

39
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,819
It may be defamation due to factual information.

40
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,649
Did you think I'd flinch if you threw random things at me?

41
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,289
How dare you make up this soap opera...

42
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:16,559
with zero evidence just by eavesdropping on my call?

43
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:19,659
Were you trying to use whatever you could to get me?

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,099
You're rather talkative. You must be scared.

45
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:26,969
I'm not scared at all.

46
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,939
Go ahead and try to track me down.

47
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,608
If you find anything, make sure you let me know.

48
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,619
How did she notice?

49
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:52,789
It didn't seem like she knew it was Ji Seok.

50
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:05,409
She acted tough because she felt guilty.

51
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,578
I'll make sure I find who the guy is.

52
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:30,369
Ha Na found out I was seeing someone else.

53
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:35,798
- What did she say? - She asked me to my face...

54
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,409
and said it must be someone at work.

55
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:40,608
Does she know this is you?

56
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,809
- No. - Are you sure?

57
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:45,279
If she thought it was me, she would've asked me first.

58
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,219
It didn't seem like she knew anything.

59
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,849
Then, how did she know?

60
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,518
That must be it.

61
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:56,728
She overheard me when we were on the phone,

62
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:58,358
just before you dropped the article on disposal...

63
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,488
and when they worked on the shredded file.

64
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,629
You already gave away that it was someone at work.

65
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:03,399
If Ha Na knows,

66
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,668
Hwang Jin Goo will also find out very soon.

67
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:07,969
We better be careful.

68
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,238
Let's go inside.

69
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,969
You must be tired after your first day of business.

70
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,608
It still feels weird when everyone treats me as the owner.

71
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,949
Other than that, it felt hectic, but I had fun.

72
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,649
It's the most important to have fun.

73
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:24,818
How was the sales?

74
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,118
That's a secret.

75
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,558
You are already such a business owner.

76
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:34,298
Right. I want to say goodbye to the chairwoman one of these days.

77
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:38,399
- I had to leave without doing that. - Okay, then.

78
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,599
There's no problem between you and Se Young because of me, right?

79
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,868
It seemed like you two were doing fine.

80
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:45,909
We are.

81
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:59,188
To me, that sounds like you don't love me.

82
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,428
Love.

83
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:09,628
Mr. Hwang, what do you see in Se Young to marry her?

84
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,068
I've known her for a long time since when we were children.

85
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,608
Everything happened naturally and led to our marriage.

86
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,108
But you must love her if you want to marry her.

87
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,048
Is that love?

88
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,748
Why did you meet Ji Seok?

89
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:32,289
And if you did, you shouldn't have let Jin Goo see you.

90
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:36,358
I made a good excuse. Did he say something?

91
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:37,928
He doesn't believe you.

92
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,259
It seems like he's suspicious of Ji Seok and me.

93
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,969
Exactly! Stop seeing that punk.

94
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,399
If you keep doing this, you'll get caught.

95
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:50,339
- Cut him out of your life. - I'll be careful.

96
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,539
- What about playing both sides? - I'll start that now.

97
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:12,029
- Hey, are you getting a massage? - Yes.

98
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,899
I was tired, but my fatigue melted away...

99
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,428
with the massaging and tapping.

100
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,868
Yeo Jin, I...

101
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:22,639
Gosh.

102
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,639
I wasn't so sure...

103
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:27,678
if I should tell you this.

104
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,308
What is it?

105
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:34,719
I went to the police station with Se Young this morning, right?

106
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,389
The police said there was a previous report...

107
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,459
on suspicion of child abuse regarding Eun Chong.

108
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,089
What kind of abuse?

109
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:49,029
The kid was told to pick up empty bottles.

110
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,168
"Empty bottles?"

111
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:53,469
And he was told to beg for money, too.

112
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:55,599
"Beg for money?"

113
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,839
Did the police tell you that?

114
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,009
No, that was...

115
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:02,509
Well...

116
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:08,178
It was Yu Jin's ex-boyfriend's mom.

117
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:09,878
Her ex-boyfriend's mom?

118
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,748
How do you know her?

119
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,558
She was lurking in front of our place, so I asked who she was.

120
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:17,389
She said she was Yu Jin's ex-boyfriend's mother.

121
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,329
She was in front of our house?

122
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,459
How did she know Yu Jin was my daughter?

123
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,298
She must've told her.

124
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:28,599
She said she wouldn't tell anyone. You don't have to worry.

125
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,168
So? How did he end up begging for money?

126
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,878
Yu Jin took out a housing lease...

127
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,378
of 50,000 dollars under her ex's name.

128
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,579
Eun Chong went out...

129
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:42,279
and posted flyers to find part-time jobs to pay that back.

130
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:45,988
Goodness.

131
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,529
You're Yu Jin's son?

132
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:56,628
A seven-year-old successor?

133
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,998
Gosh, look at that. Isn't that a huge bubble?

134
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:02,938
Yes, that's huge.

135
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:05,509
Tap.

136
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:07,178
I popped the bubble.

137
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,339
It popped.

138
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,349
I'm not very good at this.

139
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,289
Can you show me how to do it?

140
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,889
Mix it like this.

141
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,428
Then, stretch it out.

142
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,428
It stretches out so easily.

143
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:32,568
Se Young looked back on herself quite a lot after nudging his head.

144
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:37,068
Eun Chong seems very creative, and he has good focus, too.

145
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:38,609
I must've taken after my mommy.

146
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:43,109
I heard my mommy was good at arts and crafts.

147
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,948
I see, Eun Chong. You must've taken after your mommy.

148
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,588
What do you want to be when you grow up?

149
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:52,889
I'm a human. Do I have to be something else?

150
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,088
What? Goodness.

151
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,259
I'm home.

152
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:59,289
- Auntie Ha Na! - Hey.

153
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,159
Hey, there. Were you having fun?

154
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,428
I was playing with slime.

155
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,769
- Welcome back, Yu Jin. - Hey.

156
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:10,308
- Have you had dinner? - I'll whip up something.

157
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:13,139
- Eun Chong, let me get changed. - Okay.

158
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:26,348
Eun Chong, have you ever put up flyers to get part-time jobs?

159
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,318
How did you know?

160
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,688
Why did you do that?

161
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,428
I wanted to help Auntie Ha Na,

162
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,499
but I only made 50 cents.

163
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:38,968
Yes?

164
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:44,409
Mom, would you like a cup of tea?

165
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,109
No, I'm fine.

166
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:48,838
How's work?

167
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:53,479
Mom, I want to include a cruise trip for the mother-daughter tour.

168
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:56,578
There's a place called Seongbuk Port in Incheon.

169
00:09:57,048 --> 00:09:59,418
I lived there when I was ten.

170
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:03,659
That place is so famous for the beautiful sunset...

171
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:04,729
Stop.

172
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:09,359
I don't want to discuss seasides, ports, or cruise trips.

173
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,999
I don't like how it reminds me of the time when I lost you.

174
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:17,838
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,568
I need to get some rest.

176
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,379
Okay.

177
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,078
Eun Chong, let's go. Grandma needs to rest.

178
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,578
You can let him play.

179
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,688
Okay.

180
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,688
Get some rest, then.

181
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,769
How did this little kid end up begging for money?

182
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,979
Why couldn't both Mom and Se Young...

183
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,548
be freed from that memory even after I returned?

184
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:07,889
Yu Jin, will you take a seat for a moment?

185
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:10,259
Okay.

186
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,869
Hey, about that photo you lost.

187
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,369
Did you ask why it was in your mom's room?

188
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:22,769
She didn't know, either.

189
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:24,769
Really?

190
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,308
It wasn't just your photo.

191
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,609
Who would leave a photo you took with total strangers in her room?

192
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,088
Did she take it there and forget about it?

193
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:39,818
Wasn't it you, Aunt Myung Ji?

194
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:44,229
Did she want to see Eun Chong's baby photo?

195
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:47,529
Why would she want to see Eun Chong's baby photo?

196
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:52,328
She thinks of him like he's her own grandson.

197
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,999
I also didn't think she should get mad at you...

198
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,769
when he scalded himself that time.

199
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,838
She yelled at her daughter over a stranger's son.

200
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:06,009
I'm grateful that she adores him so much.

201
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,078
"Grateful?"

202
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,418
Don't you feel slighted?

203
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,718
Maybe a little,

204
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,588
but I'm more grateful.

205
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,989
So, please don't tell me anything negative about her.

206
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,999
Right. Of course, I won't.

207
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,568
- Please excuse me. - Okay.

208
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:35,909
Goodness. You have no idea she's taking advantage of you.

209
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:37,979
What a foolish girl. Gosh.

210
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,588
What's wrong? Is it hard to play both sides?

211
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,688
She's kind of weird.

212
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,458
What did she say?

213
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,769
It'll seem odd to anyone...

214
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:02,698
because she adores Eun Chong more than her daughter.

215
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:08,109
Eun Chong is just that lucky.

216
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,109
And Mom's just that loving.

217
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,578
But it'd be nice...

218
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:19,948
if she treated me with more warmth and affection.

219
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,058
Why is she laughing so hard all day?

220
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,629
She also laughed when she talked about that person who got scammed.

221
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:37,308
You'll lose that laughter right away once I find that man and show him.

222
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,509
He's Chairwoman Shin's grandson?

223
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,509
So, she made your sister into a fake daughter...

224
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:44,109
- to protect her grandson? - Yes.

225
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,578
How can she do that?

226
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,489
You found out everything now. What's your plan?

227
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,249
When she gets exposed as a fake daughter,

228
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:56,789
people will naturally find out that the boy is her grandson.

229
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:58,458
The problem is this.

230
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,359
I don't know how to tell Ha Na...

231
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:04,098
that boy is her enemy's blood.

232
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:06,568
It would feel like...

233
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,968
the world was crashing down on her.

234
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:13,068
And the boy would feel the same way.

235
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,979
Your sister and that boy didn't do anything wrong.

236
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,149
Do you think she'll accept him even after she finds out?

237
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:23,989
For now, there is a 50-50 chance.

238
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:26,818
What do you think?

239
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:29,759
As you just said, that boy isn't at fault.

240
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:33,558
His only crime is that he's of Chairwoman Shin's blood.

241
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:37,629
So, if I can take advantage of him to get revenge,

242
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,729
I will.

243
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,869
"Take advantage of him?" How?

244
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:45,109
I'll let Ha Na adopt him.

245
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,109
If the boy becomes her son,

246
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,509
Chairwoman Shin won't be able to mistreat her.

247
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:53,818
And she may end up becoming...

248
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:55,848
the chairwoman of Hyesung Group.

249
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,048
That's true.

250
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,818
It seems like Chairwoman Shin and Se Young's mom are...

251
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,859
interfering with the adoption.

252
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,958
I get Chairwoman Shin because he's her grandson.

253
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,259
But what about Yoon Se Young's mom?

254
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,729
I think she knows that Ha Na is a fake.

255
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:23,409
You drive.

256
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,609
- Why? - You'll drive from now on.

257
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:27,218
Take it.

258
00:15:28,348 --> 00:15:30,249
Driving around isn't even a big deal.

259
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,188
You can wait downstairs.

260
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:44,468
Hello. Yes, I called.

261
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:48,338
It's about the home visit you're making this weekend.

262
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:51,808
Can you make it seem like it's spontaneous?

263
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,639
"The home visit?"

264
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,078
During the last visit,

265
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:57,109
someone made a false report of child abuse,

266
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,308
so we couldn't finish.

267
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,218
This time, I thought I should keep it a secret.

268
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:19,828
Can I do that?

269
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:22,739
They're coming back for another home visit?

270
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:24,808
What do we do? How did that happen so fast?

271
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,509
You need to get to work. I'll find a way.

272
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:28,879
Call me when you find a way.

273
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,078
Okay. Go, now.

274
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,749
This is bad.

275
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,188
They're doing another home visit this weekend.

276
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:40,818
How are you going to stop this?

277
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,638
Hey, stop slamming on the brakes.

278
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,568
How many times do you have to reverse to park?

279
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,338
It's a little difficult today.

280
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:08,279
Hey!

281
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,148
Darn it.

282
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,118
Goodness.

283
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,019
You're doing this on purpose.

284
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,759
Stop picking a fight and get out.

285
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,588
Darn it.

286
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:36,239
- What are you doing? - It's Mr. Yoon.

287
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:55,029
How long do I have to live as her hidden daughter?

288
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:11,779
Why is she driving?

289
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,878
She's Yoon Yu Jin, Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

290
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:16,679
You saw me?

291
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,148
That's what I want to know.

292
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,818
She's been laughing whenever she saw me since yesterday.

293
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,689
And she began her power trips again.

294
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:28,058
You're the one who has power. Why would she do that?

295
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:29,229
Exactly.

296
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,628
I won't let her get away with it.

297
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:34,169
I'm Yoon Yu Jin. She can't harass me for long.

298
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:36,439
She'll back down soon enough.

299
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:38,838
She must've found out that Ha Na was a fake.

300
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:42,779
How's the adoption process going?

301
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:45,679
Yes, I talked to the agency this morning.

302
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:49,419
I asked to make it spontaneous as you suggested, and they agreed.

303
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,519
- Thanks. - Call me when the visit is over.

304
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:55,858
Okay.

305
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:00,658
Why don't we all meet at Ji Chang's tteokbokki place,

306
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,259
including Eun Chong?

307
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,868
It'd be nice for the entire family to go and show him some love.

308
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:10,499
We can do it on the weekend after the home visit.

309
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,078
Yes, okay. That day sounds great.

310
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:18,749
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

311
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:21,148
Ms. Yoon, you can tell us now.

312
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:23,648
Something good recently happened to you, right?

313
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:24,888
No, not much.

314
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:27,588
But you look so radiant these days,

315
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:28,789
and you're always smiling.

316
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,759
You can't be dating anyone new, so you must've made money.

317
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:34,828
That's not it.

318
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:38,169
I'm doing my best to live a lighthearted and happy life.

319
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:44,808
While we're on the subject, let me share a fun story.

320
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,039
What? A fake?

321
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,709
What about the real daughter?

322
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:52,179
Is she dead?

323
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,648
Ha Na, you can join us, too.

324
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,949
It's okay. I have to catch up on work.

325
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:01,259
You can come, Ms. Goo.

326
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,289
She's sharing a shocking story with us.

327
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,098
What is it?

328
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,769
Yesterday, I mentioned this person who got scammed, remember?

329
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,868
She was the daughter of an affluent family,

330
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:22,179
- but she found out she was a fake. - "A fake?"

331
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:25,949
Everything after that was tragic, so I couldn't share the rest.

332
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:27,548
She'd leave on her own, right?

333
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,318
She shouldn't.

334
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:30,618
She should hold out until the end.

335
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:33,519
I'd feel too betrayed to stay in that house.

336
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:36,959
Forget money or whatever. I'd want to leave right away.

337
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:40,999
You're right. It'd hurt too deeply.

338
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:43,259
If you think about it, it's like deceiving...

339
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,699
and making a fool of someone.

340
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:46,898
It only lasted a moment,

341
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:49,739
but she lived a good life in comfort with that rich family.

342
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:53,838
I'd love to live as someone rich even if it ended like this.

343
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:54,979
Me, too.

344
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,548
The family used her as a fake daughter?

345
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:00,348
Ms. Goo, how would you feel...

346
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,578
if someone used you as a fake daughter?

347
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:06,348
I never thought about that.

348
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:10,588
But I'd hate anyone who deceived me, even if they were rich.

349
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,158
Gosh, bad news. This was about you.

350
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:20,029
- You can pick it up. - Okay.

351
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:27,408
Hello? You've reached the Travel Service Department.

352
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,439
Okay.

353
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,279
Ms. Yoon, Director Goo wants to see you.

354
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:39,019
Your brother, Ji Seok, is the other man you want to find.

355
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:40,548
Know your fight before you start it.

356
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,858
Did your friends upload the photos on social media accounts?

357
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:48,798
Her phone broke, so she lost all the photos.

358
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,828
Gosh, what a shame.

359
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,499
If I had known, I would've taken the photos.

360
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:57,138
She couldn't have met with only one friend,

361
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,368
yet she had zero photos?

362
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:03,308
Did you find my power trips on Goo Ha Na unpleasant?

363
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:05,209
She's Yoon Yu Jin, not Goo Ha Na.

364
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:08,919
I didn't get why you'd do that to Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

365
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:11,818
Is there something I don't know?

366
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,088
I just don't like her.

367
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:17,828
You know that I hate her and why.

368
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:21,429
Because of Hwang Jin Goo?

369
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:23,298
Her involvement with you is even worse.

370
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:26,999
What if Chairwoman Shin finds out?

371
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,898
She wouldn't condone you harassing her daughter.

372
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:33,709
Did you call me so you could tell me to stop harassing Ha Na?

373
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:35,608
It's a cautionary tale, just in case you get hurt.

374
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,148
Why would I get hurt? Yoon Yu Jin is a fake.

375
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,779
You said she remembered everything.

376
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:43,979
What did she remember?

377
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:46,648
I was mistaken.

378
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:49,219
She knows Ha Na is a fake,

379
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:51,128
but she's keeping it a secret for a while?

380
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:56,328
It's Jin Goo.

381
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:02,739
Hey, I'm at the hotel.

382
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:07,209
Right now? Okay.

383
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:15,519
You might find a snitch on Hwang Jin Goo's side. Be careful.

384
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,749
"A party?"

385
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,949
Your friends and my friends can all meet up.

386
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:23,318
My friends are busy, so I don't know if they're free.

387
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,658
They'll be happy to meet with my friends.

388
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,298
How was the venue for your bridal shower?

389
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:33,568
- Was it in Gangnam? - Yes.

390
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:34,838
Call your friends.

391
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,108
- Let's find a date to meet up. - Okay.

392
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:51,118
Hey, it's me.

393
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:53,548
If Jin Goo asks,

394
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:56,058
tell the girls to say...

395
00:23:56,058 --> 00:23:58,328
you all threw me a bridal shower in Gangnam last weekend.

396
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,298
If she had to lie to me to meet someone,

397
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,169
it must be a guy.

398
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:13,009
Who could it be? Is it someone at work?

399
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,618
Mr. Hwang.

400
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:25,949
Yes, Ms. Goo.

401
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:28,118
I have the edits on the mother-daughter tour.

402
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:30,658
Right. Thank you.

403
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,358
Is something going on?

404
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,699
- Why? - You look rigid,

405
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:39,398
unlike how you usually are.

406
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,808
So, if...

407
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:46,368
Yes?

408
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:51,378
Never mind. Good work.

409
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:53,749
- I'll take a good look. - Okay.

410
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:01,158
Ms. Goo made Eun Chong beg for money?

411
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:02,519
Myung Ji said she heard it.

412
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,058
That woman must've come to our place.

413
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:07,658
How did she know Ms. Goo lived there?

414
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:10,058
Ha Na could've told her.

415
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:11,828
I'm not so sure yet.

416
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,769
Should I just ask her?

417
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:17,298
You can ask when you're sure of everything.

418
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,838
This may cause a misunderstanding.

419
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:23,779
Did she really make Eun Chong beg for money?

420
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:28,048
Her love for him seemed genuine.

421
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,719
I also can't believe it.

422
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,749
I still want to check.

423
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:45,999
Danny, what kind of cake do you prefer for tteokbokki?

424
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,798
Rice cake? Flour cake?

425
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:49,239
I like both.

426
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:53,308
Me, too. We have the same taste in food.

427
00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:04,548
Try it like this. Open up.

428
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,158
How is it?

429
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,429
I knew it'd be delicious.

430
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:23,039
Mr. Owner, why are you stealing your customer's food?

431
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,009
I'm not sure how my sister snatched you,

432
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,479
but this is your chance. Run!

433
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,378
Hey, Mr. Owner. Just go.

434
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:32,949
This is my place. Where would I go?

435
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:36,919
Ji Seok, Ha Na, and Eun Chong are all coming this weekend.

436
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,348
- You heard, right? - I already know.

437
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:46,259
You know, my brother is really into exaggeration.

438
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,798
It's great to see such realistic siblings.

439
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:50,898
Hey, is that a compliment or condemnation?

440
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:52,229
It's a compliment.

441
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:53,568
Gosh.

442
00:26:53,898 --> 00:26:55,868
It's not so great to see.

443
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:00,338
My gosh.

444
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:04,108
You still haven't found a way?

445
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:06,279
Will you let her adopt him?

446
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,578
I'll find a way.

447
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:12,289
I can't do anything here,

448
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,658
so I'll have to lure Eun Chong out,

449
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,618
but that's not so easy.

450
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,689
What will you do after you lure him outside?

451
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:21,398
What do you think? Just stall for time.

452
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:29,368
Did she really make that young boy beg for money?

453
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:36,078
Is he taking the dressing off at the hospital on the weekend?

454
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,209
Yes.

455
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:39,908
After the hospital, we're going to Uncle Ji Chang's tteokbokki place.

456
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:44,249
"The hospital?"

457
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,519
Is Eun Chong going to the hospital to take the dressing off?

458
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:51,358
When?

459
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:52,959
- On the weekend. - I see.

460
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:58,628
Fate is on my side. That's the perfect day.

461
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:02,769
You've been so patient, Eun Chong.

462
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:04,469
Good for you.

463
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:07,608
Is there something you want to do once your hand is better?

464
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:10,808
I want to play with sand at the kindergarten...

465
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:12,679
and go to a kids' cafe.

466
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,078
We can do that.

467
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:15,749
- Really? - Yes.

468
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:25,058
You can use this hand to do everything now.

469
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,388
I'm so happy to be done.

470
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:30,328
- Lee Eun Chong's guardian, please. - Yes?

471
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,798
- Sit here for a second. - Okay.

472
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:40,709
Hello.

473
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,378
- Here's the bill. - Okay.

474
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:48,648
- Here. - Thank you.

475
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:05,999
- Here's your card. - Thanks.

476
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,298
- Thank you. - Sure.

477
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,759
Excuse me. Have you seen the boy who was sitting here?

478
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,229
He just left.

479
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:36,858
Thank you.

480
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:42,939
Eun Chong!

481
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,969
Where are you?

482
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:47,469
Eun Chong!

483
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:50,209
Excuse me.

484
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,308
Have you seen a boy in a blue jacket?

485
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:53,479
No.

486
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,578
Eun Chong!

487
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:06,729
Mr. Hwang.

488
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:08,328
Are you at home?

489
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:11,158
Can you e-mail me the edited version of the mom-daughter tour proposal?

490
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,529
No.

491
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:15,638
Mr. Hwang...

492
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:18,808
What's wrong? Is something going on?

493
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:20,739
Eun Chong...

494
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:23,108
disappeared.

495
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,539
What?

496
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,979
Today was the home visit?

497
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:28,919
I didn't hear anything.

498
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,148
This was a spontaneous visit.

499
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:34,088
So, I didn't even tell the guardian.

500
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,588
I can't let the adoption proceed like this.

501
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:41,429
She went to the hospital with Eun Chong.

502
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:43,658
- You should call her. - Okay.

503
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:52,568
Are you at the hospital?

504
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:56,108
The agency just came for Eun Chong. When will you come home?

505
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,009
I can't be there now.

506
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:01,308
You aren't done yet?

507
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:03,878
I don't think we can do this today. Please ask her to return.

508
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:06,588
What's wrong? Is something going on?

509
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:11,588
Eun Chong is gone.

510
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:14,489
What? "Eun Chong is gone?"

511
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:16,929
What?

512
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:20,269
Eun Chong is gone?

513
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,769
What are you talking about?

514
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:25,269
He was there while I paid the bill at the hospital,

515
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,039
but he suddenly disappeared.

516
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,479
"Suddenly disappeared?"

517
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:32,048
Have you looked everywhere?

518
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,919
Have you called the police?

519
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,719
- Aunt Yeo Jin. - Yeo Jin.

520
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:43,259
Eun Chong!

521
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:46,588
Eun Chong!

522
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:49,898
Eun Chong!

523
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:45,148
(Cinderella Game)

524
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:47,588
Someone must've known he'd be at the hospital.

525
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:48,759
Who could've leaked the information?

526
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,628
Didn't this look completely staged?

527
00:32:51,628 --> 00:32:53,789
I need to put a bodyguard on Eun Chong.

528
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:54,858
It's been a while.

529
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:57,328
Are you crazy? How did you know I was here?

530
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:00,669
I heard Ha Na was Hyesung Group's hidden daughter.

531
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:03,269
Why don't you adopt Eun Chong?

532
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:05,439
Why don't we take a break?

533
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:07,068
I think I know who took Eun Chong.

534
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,439
- Is it someone you know? - Yes.
