- Auntie Ha Na.
- What?

6
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,119
What's going on, Ha Na?

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,289
Ji Eun stole the outfit
the chairwoman bought for me.

8
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,390
What?

9
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:18,160
She won't pick up.

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,429
Hey.

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,059
- Did you come in just now?
- Yes.

12
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,399
I got some gimbap.
You should have some before you go.

13
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,399
I don't have an appetite.
I'm leaving.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,909
Bye. Have a great day.

(Hardship Vending Machine)

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,119
Gosh, she really won't give up.

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,890
I'll wear it for a while,
then give it back to you.

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,049
Darn it.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,759
(Bring it back with the tag!
I'm returning it to the chairwoman!)

20
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:57,729
Bring it back with the tag!

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm returning it to the chairwoman!

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's she saying?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Why would she
give back what she got?

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,000
My gosh.

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,840
Bring it back while she's nice,
you thieving brat!

26
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,409
Has he lost his mind?

27
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,579
I was just borrowing it shortly.
Why are they making a huge scene?

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,379
They're so annoying!

29
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,819
All right. Let me see you.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,359
Santa Claus is coming
to the kindergarten today, right?

31
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,930
- You'll get presents! Good for you.
- Yes.

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,200
What do you want
from Santa Claus, Auntie?

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,230
What do I want?

34
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,000
One moment.

35
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,709
Hello, Detective Min.

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,310
Do you have the result?

37
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:50,379
Yes, Eun Chong's DNA
didn't match with hers.

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,549
Is that so?

39
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,790
Yes, I understand.
Thank you for your hard work.

40
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,090
Yes, goodbye.

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,069
- Eun Chong.
- She wasn't my grandmother?

42
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,240
No.

43
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,110
I think it's good news for you.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,710
You may get to meet
your real grandma.

45
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,120
Okay.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,050
Let me see you.

47
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,530
He was the boy I met last time
at the hospital.

48
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,830
Okay. Like this.

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,979
You can't suddenly back out.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,620
The children were
looking forward to this.

53
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,159
Can you send us someone else?

54
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,659
I'll look for someone, too.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,930
Whose grandfather are you?

56
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,330
Yes, hello.

57
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,569
The children
just seemed quite adorable.

58
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,580
Excuse me.

59
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,750
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,289
- Lee Ro Un.
- Yes!

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,060
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

Grandpa, are you all right?

68
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,389
- Grandpa, are you all right?
- Grandpa, are you all right?

69
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,319
Merry Christmas.

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,060
- Grandpa, are you all right?
- Grandpa, are you all right?

00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,970
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

72
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,639
Please have this.

73
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,850
Thank you very much for your help.

74
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,750
The man we hired to play Santa
suddenly couldn't come.

75
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,949
But I thought you'd be perfect
when I saw your beard.

76
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,220
I hope the children liked it.

77
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,959
They were thrilled.

78
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,990
This isn't much,
but it's for your trouble.

79
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,430
No, it's all right.
Thank you for letting me do this.

80
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,439
Thank you
for giving me a chance to do this.

81
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,339
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,750
I began to cry more often
as I reached my old age.

83
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,810
Yes.

84
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,220
Please call me anytime
whenever you need help.

85
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:24,360
I already retired,
so I didn't have a business card.

86
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,730
Please call me at this number.

87
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,870
I'll run over anytime.

88
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,269
Yes, Mr. Han Min Su.

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,370
So,

90
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,279
- about that boy, Eun Chong...
- Do you know him?

91
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,610
No.

92
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,410
He looked very bright and energetic.

93
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,149
Doesn't he?
And he's the most considerate, too.

94
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,850
His parents
must've brought him up well.

95
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,019
Yes.

96
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,629
Santa.

97
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,839
Wait, why are you wearing
a different outfit?

98
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,509
I can't let people find out
who I am, so I change my clothes...

99
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,980
when I go out.

100
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,819
But Santa,

101
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,420
can I have a different present
than this one?

102
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,560
Why? Do you not like it?

103
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,290
Well, it's not that.

104
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,600
Instead of a present,
can you grant my auntie's wish?

105
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,569
What's your auntie's wish?

106
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:44,870
My wish is for our family
to be healthy,

107
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,470
be on good terms,
and live happily ever after.

108
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,910
It's for our family to be healthy,

109
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,350
be on good terms,
and live happily ever after.

110
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,550
All right. I'll do my best...

111
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,920
to let her wish come true.

112
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,220
You can keep that present.

113
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,259
But Santa.

114
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,459
Then, who gives you a present?

115
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:17,339
I don't need one...

116
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,639
I'll give it to you!

117
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,050
The NFS won't make a mistake.

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,250
If you still feel uneasy,
you can update it regularly with me.

119
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:39,090
And you should check
if Mr. Yoon has read his e-mail.

120
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,220
Yes, right.

121
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,000
(Unread)

122
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,659
He hasn't read it.

123
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,600
He should've left his number
instead of sending me pottery.

124
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,210
Even if I died tomorrow,
he couldn't show up at my funeral.

125
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,769
It hasn't been a day yet.

126
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,639
I'm sure he'll read it.

127
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,080
I'll keep talking to the police...

128
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,950
to make sure
they quickly transfer...

129
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,620
your daughter's DNA to the NFS.

130
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,950
Please let me know anytime
if there's anything I can do.

131
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,690
You know that
I'm always on standby, right?

132
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,929
Yes, thank you.

133
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:19,000
Also, Richard Han postponed
his arrival to Korea.

134
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,330
He must've done that
after noticing our suspicion.

135
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,139
Why does he avoid meeting us?

136
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:29,539
So, why don't you try
to get him on a video call?

137
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,399
Santa, please stay healthy.

138
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,590
Where could he have gone to
as soon as he arrived in Korea?

139
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,230
It seemed so important that
he moved up his arrival.

140
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,399
It must be about his family,

141
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,529
but he never says
anything about them.

142
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,039
The two of us
don't know anything about him.

143
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,840
It's Mr. Han.

144
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,710
Yes, Mr. Han. Where are you?

145
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,980
I need to see you today.

146
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,889
Yes, I'll see you there.

147
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,700
I met Eun Chong.

148
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,269
He was Yu Jin's son.

149
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,570
What's your mother's name?

150
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,870
Lee Du Na.

151
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,779
He said
his mother's name was Lee Du Na.

152
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,309
Congratulations.

153
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,379
Can you find out...

154
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,809
about Eun Chong
and Ms. Goo's living conditions?

155
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,080
Yes, sir.

156
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,690
And is the reinvestigation request
for a hit-and-run accident...

157
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,159
only available
for the victim's family?

158
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,820
Generally speaking, yes.

159
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,759
But if you believed it was a crime
and not just an accident,

160
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,659
then you could make a request
even if you weren't family.

161
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,629
However, even if you don't have
hard evidence,

162
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,840
you need to provide new information
or circumstantial evidence.

163
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,200
Could Eun Chong fall into danger...

164
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,169
if the reinvestigation began?

165
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,539
We cannot overlook the possibility.

166
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,230
I felt bad for her
on our way to the NFS.

167
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,629
It'd be better if she could be with
her husband in times like these.

168
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,299
Aunt Yeo Jin stayed strong
through the toughest time alone.

169
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,470
I find Uncle Sung Ho kind of awful.

170
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,169
How could he do this for 20 years?

171
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,539
It had been too long.

172
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:19,980
Anyway, we can only learn if someone
contaminated the DNA on purpose...

173
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,110
only after we learn
if his DNA was also contaminated.

174
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,950
But he won't check his e-mail.

175
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,450
Aunt Yeo Jin sent him an e-mail?

176
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,750
She didn't have
his number or address.

177
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,049
That was all she could do.

178
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,289
I hope he checks it soon.

179
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,389
I can't let him do that.

180
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,700
In my opinion, they seem
to miss each other a lot.

181
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,200
Then, why would they spend
20 years apart?

182
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,970
They were too afraid to be reunited.

183
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,940
It could feel like
the pain might return...

184
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,470
and make their lives harder.
They're afraid.

185
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,879
I don't know.
I'm not sure about that.

186
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,320
Are you free this afternoon?

187
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,450
I'm doing an on-site survey
for the Dubai tourists with Ms. Goo.

188
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:02,789
Do you want to come?

189
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:06,019
No, I'm busy, too.

190
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,669
The chairwoman requested
at least a video call...

191
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,840
now that Mr. Richard Han
postponed his arrival.

192
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,549
I'd prefer that
she asked me this herself,

193
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:29,980
but I heard it
from you again, Mr. Hwang.

194
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,750
- I'll check my schedule.
- Okay.

195
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,120
Didn't you appoint Ms. Goo?

196
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,419
- Yes.
- Could she really trust you?

197
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,230
I thought she might end up falling.

198
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,960
You want us to fall, don't you?

199
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,600
But I'm sorry.

200
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,759
The Dubai contract is
working out wonderfully.

201
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,529
You should stick to one thing.

202
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,600
If you worry about her, do that.
If you ignore her, do that.

203
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:53,769
You turned a blind eye to her...

204
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,539
when she almost got kicked out
after getting framed as a thief.

205
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,179
Now you're worried about her fall,
so it is quite confusing.

206
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,009
I hate confusion...

207
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,679
when it comes
to both people and work.

208
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,019
Ms. Goo.

209
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,659
Where are we going again?

210
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,129
I know most tourist attractions,
so we don't need to go there.

211
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,570
We'll go to a Korean restaurant
and the Kimchi Experience Center.

212
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,600
I'll get the car.
Wait for me at the front gate.

213
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,840
Yes, sir.

214
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,009
Going out to do an on-site survey
for the Dubai tourists?

215
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,450
I hope you aren't wasting your time.

216
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,309
But still, good luck until the end.

217
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,779
You must bring this
to a successful finish.

218
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,929
You don't have to mind him.

219
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,830
We just have to do our job.
Let's go.

220
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,399
Okay.

221
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,240
Let's go with Course A
and customize the main dish.

222
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,279
Yes, please leave out meat
from japchae...

223
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,080
and add in more mushrooms.

224
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,450
You can't use eggs, either,

225
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,149
so please top it with paprika.

226
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,220
Yes, I understand.

227
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,919
- We cannot have any salted seafood.
- Okay.

228
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,789
I think traditional hanbok will feel
more authentic than modernized ones.

229
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,259
Can you replace this
with traditional hanbok?

230
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,230
Then, it'll cost a little more.

231
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,600
We'll pay the difference.

232
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,799
- Please make it traditional.
- Okay.

233
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,889
- Hey.
- Mr. Han?

234
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,460
What happened, Mr. Han?

235
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,700
Your outfit and that beard.

236
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,970
Do I look good?

237
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,769
Yes, it looks natural on you.

238
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,240
Why are you in a disguise?

239
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,700
This is how I'll look from now on.

240
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,710
From now on, Richard Han's identity
will remain absolutely hidden.

241
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,779
May I ask
why you're taking things this far?

242
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,980
The reason?
You'll find out soon enough.

243
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:18,850
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,289
When we said
your arrival was postponed,

245
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,620
Chairwoman Shin requested
a video call.

246
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,960
If you turn it down,
she'll grow more suspicious of you.

247
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,529
Try to postpone it
as much as you can.

248
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
And she has begun
to look for her daughter?

249
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes, sir. A few days ago,
there was someone...

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,899
who matched her DNA on the database,

251
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,470
so she conducted
a parentage test, too.

252
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,409
She must've been greatly shocked
to find out she wasn't her daughter.

253
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,070
I see.

254
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,509
I heard her DNA was contaminated.

255
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,509
If this was intentional...

256
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,210
It must've been done by those
who are after Hyesung Group.

257
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,350
Can you find out who it is?

258
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,190
The strongest candidates are...

259
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,549
Yoon Se Young, her mother,
and Hwang Jin Goo.

260
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,990
People are always betrayed
by those who are the closest.

261
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,990
- Chairwoman Shin must know that.
- Yes, sir.

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,730
So, her approach will become
even more cautious.

263
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,579
She went to the NFS today
and registered her DNA.

264
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,349
Don't let her daughter's DNA
go over to the NFS easily.

265
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,819
Drag it out as much as you can
by using legal grounds.

266
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,119
I'll pay you as soon
as you're done with your job.

267
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,390
I need to find more ways
to get more money.

268
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,869
Director Choi,
I'll meet you there in an hour.

269
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:47,670
One moment.

270
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,170
(Se Young)

271
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,210
I'm getting another call. Bye.

272
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,279
Hey, what is it?

273
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,450
She sent him an e-mail?

274
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,279
But Uncle Sung Ho hasn't read it.

275
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,490
What if he reads it and checks
if the DNA is contaminated?

276
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,289
Do you think it's easy to prove
someone's intention?

277
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,690
You don't have to be scared.

278
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,000
You keep saying that,
but words aren't helping.

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,630
Stop whining!

280
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,900
Just trust me.

281
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,940
I have to go. Bye.

282
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,240
I taught her all her life,

283
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:28,109
yet she remained
too soft-hearted and docile.

284
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,160
Are you leaving?

285
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,029
The duck soup was still untouched.

286
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,630
You should boil it
and have it with the chairwoman...

287
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,859
Why would she eat something
that was already days old?

288
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,930
That rude brat.

289
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,470
You and I...

290
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,069
would be the same
without the chairwoman.

291
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,980
No matter what the situation is,
I'm still your in-law.

292
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,849
I'm only putting up with you
because of Jin Goo.

293
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,720
Anyway, why is she so sullen again?

294
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,190
Why haven't you found any dirt
to kick Head Director Goo out?

295
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,559
I couldn't find anything.

296
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,900
He has no girl problems like most
men do and no money trouble either.

297
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,400
If you couldn't find any dirt,

298
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,500
you should put some on him
and give him some.

299
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,569
How long are we going to wait?

300
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:30,170
We might end up
getting caught instead.

301
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,380
Do you think he's an easy fight?

302
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
When Richard Han returns to Korea...

303
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,950
And when exactly is he coming?

304
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,279
Is he actually coming?

305
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,450
Well, it was postponed,
so we'd have to wait.

306
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,220
Good grief.

307
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,259
Hey.

308
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,089
I need to find some funding.

309
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,930
Can you take out a fake loan?

310
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,299
That's too dangerous.

311
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,799
If anyone outside
hears about this...

312
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,900
I recently found
60,000m² of land for sale.

313
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,170
It's near the new town of Eunseong,

314
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,279
so it'll go up at least threefold
if you build a resort on it.

315
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,640
"Threefold?"

316
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,519
Are you sure about this?

317
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,380
Find Choi Myung Ji
when it comes to real estate.

318
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,289
Don't you know that
everything turns to gold...

319
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,990
once it goes through me?

320
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,730
There's some company fund
you can finance, right?

321
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,930
Let's start with that.

322
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,269
Goodness. My gosh.

323
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,039
Hey, duckie.

324
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,380
Both you and I are suffering a lot.

325
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:46,480
I went through a lot to make this,

326
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,250
so it would've been great
if she had a bite.

327
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,289
I didn't expect to bring it back
just the way I took it there.

328
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,759
Gosh. Goodness.

329
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,269
My goodness! Oh, no.

330
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:10,410
No! Wait, that pot. My gosh.

331
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,839
Goodness. Hey.

332
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,940
Oh, no.

333
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,390
- My goodness.
- Granny.

334
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,960
My goodness.

335
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,890
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

336
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,890
She's President Hwang's mommy.

337
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,930
She is?

338
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,200
So, she's my sister's boss' mother?

339
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,970
My gosh. Goodness gracious.

340
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,569
Granny.

341
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,509
Hey, little one. It's you.

342
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,809
Goodness, thank you.

343
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,410
Hello. Nice to meet you.

344
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,779
I heard you were
President Hwang's mother.

345
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,119
I am the younger brother
of his subordinate, Guide Goo Ha Na.

346
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,720
My name is Goo Ji Chang.

347
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,519
Is that so? Sure.

348
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,529
Good grief.
The delicious broth is all gone.

349
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,069
Goodness, what a shame.

350
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,970
This must be the duck you bought...

351
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,099
when your grocery bag was
mixed up with my sister's.

352
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,440
There's abalone and octopus, too!

353
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,079
- Gosh, it looks so healthy.
- Gosh, it looks so healthy.

354
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,009
Do you want some?

355
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,559
Why won't you eat, Granny?

356
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:36,160
Are we devouring this
and making you lose your appetite?

357
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,930
No, it's nice to see you two
eat so well.

358
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,900
- Chew a lot and eat up.
- Okay!

359
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:44,170
Then, I'll go back to eating.

360
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,269
Granny, have a bite.

361
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,480
Goodness, you're so kind.

362
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,750
Let me give you one, too.

363
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,380
Goodness, it's all right.

364
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,720
Gosh, you're making my hand
feel embarrassed.

365
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,890
Then, I'll have it.

366
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:10,089
You don't have to mind me. Dig in.

367
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,230
- Okay.
- Okay.

368
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:23,740
The tourists from Dubai
can't eat any of these.

369
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,609
- Even tteokbokki?
- No.

370
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,410
It's made with anchovy broth.

371
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:28,710
What do they eat?

372
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,480
They had...

373
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,849
Yes, they liked hotteok.
And fish-shaped buns.

374
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:37,319
Tteokbokki is the origin
of K-street food.

375
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,759
It's a shame that they won't get
to taste this in Seoul.

376
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,390
My mom makes the meanest tteokbokki.

377
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,059
I'll let you try it
if I get a chance.

378
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,400
Okay.

379
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:52,369
You have no idea your mother is
a maid for the chairwoman's family.

380
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,980
Have some. It's hot, so blow on it.

381
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,319
Thank you.

382
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:10,990
- Ouch.
- Goodness.

383
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,720
- Are you okay? Were you burned?
- Yes.

384
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,859
Hey, you just hit her.
You need to apologize.

385
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,200
Sorry.

386
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,500
How is that a proper attitude
for an apology?

387
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,799
What do you want?

388
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,569
Mr. Hwang, I'm fine.

389
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,599
It's fine, so just go.

390
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,000
We're sorry.

391
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,109
You aren't okay.
You burned yourself.

392
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,109
Please let my hand go.

393
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,480
Right. I'm sorry.

394
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,750
Where's the pharmacy?

395
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,890
Well, Mr. Hwang.

396
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,059
Someone's calling you.

397
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,519
My phone.

398
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,559
Hello, you've reached Hwang Jin Goo.

399
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,170
Yes, the interpreter. Hello.

400
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,470
Hassan is here?

401
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,299
Yes, I understand.

402
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,640
Hassan wants to meet
at Restaurant Mirim.

403
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,140
And you, too.

404
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,980
Me?

405
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,390
He said you were the savior
who found Amira's brooch,

406
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,119
so he wanted to meet you.

407
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,460
I was really happy, too. Thank you.

408
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:22,529
Why don't we have a seat and talk?

409
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,839
May I ask what suddenly
brings him here without notice?

410
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,170
He wanted to meet you today...

411
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,539
because he'd have to postpone
sending tourists for a while,

412
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,710
the ones that were to come in
starting next month.

413
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,509
What do you mean?

414
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,880
Hassan and President Hwang are
in a meeting?

415
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,119
Yes, today will be the last supper.

416
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,029
Right, I thought you said
your sister was a tour guide.

417
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,829
Which agency does she work at?

418
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,799
She works for Hyesung Tour.

419
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,369
That's a twist of fate.

420
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,039
Is that all right with you?

421
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,640
Yes, you don't have to worry.

422
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,680
So, where have you been?

423
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,390
There was someone I missed.

424
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,289
(Unread)

425
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,930
What on earth is he up to?

426
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,700
You need to check your e-mail!

427
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,410
He still hasn't read it.

428
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,509
Who could have contaminated the DNA?

429
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,920
Who would you suspect the most
if you were me?

430
00:26:56,089 --> 00:27:00,089
Someone who would suffer the most
if your daughter returned.

431
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:02,759
In that case...

432
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,759
It's my personal take, ma'am.

433
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,130
Anybody would think so.

434
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,029
Se Young and Myung Ji would
suffer the most.

435
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,670
And Jin Goo.

436
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,240
What do you think
about President Hwang?

437
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,269
Be honest.

438
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,140
I don't think
his motivation is personal gain.

439
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,609
He wanted to repay your kindness,
so he took up a job at Hyesung...

440
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,250
and decided to marry Ms. Yoon, too.

441
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,589
Well, of course,
he must love her a lot.

442
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:33,619
But I believe the foremost reason
was to keep you safe.

443
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,529
But of course, I can't tell
everything he is thinking.

444
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,930
Was it because
you have known him for a long time?

445
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,400
You have a profound trust in him.

446
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:49,710
What about Se Young and Myung Ji?

447
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,240
You must stay suspicious
of everyone right now.

448
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:56,779
And that includes Mr. Hwang,
Ms. Yoon, and her mother.

449
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,819
But it's also dangerous
to become suspicious...

450
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,480
without any hard evidence.

451
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,519
I should be careful.

452
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,390
Your business was suspended
for three months?

453
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:09,990
What happened?

454
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,859
Local Dubaian travel agencies...

455
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,230
reported his business
for breaking the law.

456
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,640
Going out to do an on-site survey
for the Dubai tourists?

457
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,069
I hope you aren't wasting your time.

458
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,480
May we check the official notice
of business suspension?

459
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,920
Yes, you may.

460
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,819
It'd be three months at most,

461
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,019
so he'd resume the tour after that.

462
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,420
I understand the situation,

463
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,220
but you are aware this may be
a breach of contract, right?

464
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,730
What can we do?

465
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,660
Let's sign a supplementary contract
apart from the original contract.

466
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,130
Please put our terms
into the supplementary contract.

467
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,140
He'll do that.

468
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,740
But of course, under the term
that Ms. Goo is the exclusive guide.

469
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,480
Me?

470
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:05,549
The original contract was sealed
under the same term.

471
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,890
- You didn't know?
- What?

472
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,059
So, you hired me
because of the contract term...

473
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,690
with the Dubaian business.

474
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,730
You couldn't seal the deal
unless I was here.

475
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,970
- Yes.
- Yet you kept that quiet...

476
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,599
and told me to come to work...

477
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,339
- like I was a charity case.
- That's not the case.

478
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,400
I tried to tell you. I did.

479
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:31,069
I kept missing
the right time to do it.

480
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,180
But all these are
nothing but cowardly excuses.

481
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,980
I have no excuses to make.

482
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:36,980
I'm so sorry.

483
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,420
You must've had fun
toying around with me.

484
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,289
I'm going home.

485
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,789
Ms. Goo.

486
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,259
Ms. Goo.

487
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,130
Ms. Goo, wait.

488
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,700
Please hear me out until the end.

489
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,069
Right, if the contract with Dubai
gets called off,

490
00:29:58,269 --> 00:29:59,700
will I automatically be fired?

491
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,740
No, it won't get called off,

492
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,769
and even if it does,
it won't hurt you in any way.

493
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:07,009
But first, get in the car.

494
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,140
I'm taking the bus.

495
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,849
We live in the same neighborhood.
You don't need to spend money.

496
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:13,349
The bus doesn't come often,
and you'll have to call for a taxi.

497
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,680
Mind your own and go.

498
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,119
What can I do?

499
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,049
What can I do to make it up to you?

500
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,789
First, you need to let go of me.

501
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,029
That hurts. Let go of me!

502
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,369
You deserve to be mad,

503
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:32,140
and I am
utterly embarrassed right now.

504
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:35,069
I wanted to tell you everything
from the start.

505
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,609
Did someone stop you?

506
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,410
Was it Ms. Yoon?

507
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,509
No.

508
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,509
- Hassan is in Seoul?
- Yes.

509
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,480
He's meeting President Hwang
and Ms. Goo at Restaurant Mirim.

510
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,890
Why is Goo Ha Na there?

511
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,349
Hassan wanted to meet her.

512
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,660
They got a call
during their on-site survey...

513
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,319
and went there right away.

514
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,430
Why is Hassan in Seoul?

515
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,460
Mr. Hwang didn't know, either.

516
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,329
Goo Ha Na shouldn't find out
we got the contract because of her.

517
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,569
If it wasn't Ms. Yoon,
then what was the reason?

518
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,869
The chairwoman also knew
I was why you got this contract.

519
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:12,779
You heard that?
Why didn't you tell me?

520
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,509
I thought she mistook me
for someone else.

521
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,609
Only I became a total idiot.

522
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,880
I apologize sincerely for this.

523
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,549
You can say whatever you want,
so just get in the car.

524
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,089
- Let's talk on our way back.
- No, thank you.

525
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,460
It's after hours,
so please excuse me.

526
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,230
You have five minutes left.

527
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,799
It's past five on my watch.

528
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,359
Your watch is too fast.
Mine is accurate.

529
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,470
So, get in the car.

530
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,240
Get in the car
and say everything you want to.

531
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,450
Man, I can't believe this nonsense.

532
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:55,019
I don't care if it's work hours.
You can't treat your staff like...

533
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,089
Buckle up.

534
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,289
- Hello?
- Where are you?

535
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,559
Are you still at Restaurant Mirim?

536
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,289
We just walked out.

537
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,630
Why was Hassan here?

538
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,029
- Who was that?
- Let go of me!

539
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:13,400
- Is Goo Ha Na next to you?
- I'll call you at home.

540
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:19,640
This is kidnapping!

541
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,309
Yes, it is.

542
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,279
So, stay still.

543
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,160
(Cinderella Game)

544
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,589
You look nice, Auntie Ha Na!

545
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,700
I earned this with my performance,
so I'd wear it proudly from today.

546
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,869
You two are wearing
matching outfits.

547
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,400
- You need to apologize to her.
- No!

548
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,799
Ms. Goo Ha Na?

549
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,240
The Goo siblings are something.

550
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,410
You're nothing but a fraud.

551
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:24,470
And you like that fraud,
so what does that make you?

552
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,440
Please wait just a little longer.
We'll meet soon.

553
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,950
Excuse me. Hey.

554
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,980
Yes, I am Eun Chong's guardian.
What's going on?

555
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,180
"Child abuse?"
