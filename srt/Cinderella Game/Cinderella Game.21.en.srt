00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,009
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,209
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,780
(Episode 21)

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,679
What's wrong? Hey.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,419
What's wrong with the dress?

7
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,289
Did you spill juice on it?

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,859
I'm throwing that out.
It's jinxing me.

9
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,489
Just give it to the dry cleaners.

10
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,100
Goo Ha Na has the same dress!

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,760
Aunt Yeo Jin bought it for her
at the department store!

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,600
It's the same dress?

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,030
I told her not to show up at work
in that dress,

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,739
but she showed up,
almost flaunting it.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,469
It felt so disgusting
to be in the same outfit all day.

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,009
I told her to get changed,
but she wouldn't even budge!

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,439
I can't believe that brat.

18
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,380
Good grief.

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,350
She was supposed to follow
her superior's order.

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,890
Who the heck does she think she is
to act up like that?

21
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,920
Aunt Yeo Jin bought it for her
because she got the Dubai contract,

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,189
so she'd wear it and flaunt it.

23
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,990
That brat was the one
who got the Dubai contract?

24
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,130
Se Young, calm down.
Your aunt might hear you.

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,369
I'd make more money
through the Dubaian tourists and...

26
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,400
It's been postponed by three months.

27
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,469
I couldn't get the kind of money
you asked for!

28
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,670
What?

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,810
Is it also because of that brat?

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,480
Darn it! She's so irritating.

31
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,090
I even got this as a present
from the chairwoman,

32
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,560
so it felt bad to hear that
the Dubai contract got postponed.

33
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,129
I'll do even better in three months.

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,000
Ha Na, come and eat ramyeon.

35
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,670
What's wrong with that?

36
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,629
What did you do
to this expensive outfit?

37
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,569
Tell me about it.
It got hazed on the first day.

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,969
I'll wash you clean.

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,379
Why did you take the bus instead
of a taxi, carrying that heavy pot?

40
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,680
You have weak wrists, too.

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,250
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,579
Why are you apologizing?

43
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,590
Se Young's family should be sorry.

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,590
Don't say anything to her.

45
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,859
She needs to know.

46
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,060
There's no need to go around
telling everyone about this.

47
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,890
It was my fault for taking the bus.

48
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,829
You aren't their maid.

49
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,930
They didn't even touch the food
you made out of goodwill.

50
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,439
The chairwoman collapsed,
so things were hectic there.

51
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,669
Jin Goo, I'm all right.

52
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,139
There's nothing I can't do
for the chairwoman...

53
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,710
to repay her kindness
for saving your life.

54
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,509
I cooked for her
because I wanted to.

55
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,349
If she enjoys it, that's great.

56
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,889
But if she doesn't eat it,
I can't help it.

57
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,349
Why should you suffer because of me?

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,590
- It's not like you're a sinner...
- I felt so grateful...

59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,189
that I couldn't help
but bow my head to her.

60
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,000
I decided to consider her my savior
for the rest of my life.

61
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,199
And I mean it.

62
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,669
I'll repay her for her kindness.

63
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,370
I'll repay her even if it takes
my whole life, so you need to stop.

64
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:50,110
You can do your part,

65
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,379
and I also need to do mine, so...

66
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,780
You need to stop this.

67
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:55,909
I'll buy some date tea for her.

68
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,050
Homemade tea is different
from store-bought ones.

69
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,120
The chairwoman has trouble sleeping,

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,719
and I hear date tea is
good for insomnia.

71
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,560
I'll give her some
and keep some at home for winter.

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,300
- Give it back.
- Don't do it. I don't want you to.

73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,060
What's with you? Give it back to me.

74
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,270
If you keep doing this,

75
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,199
I'll stop you from working as a maid
for another family.

76
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,500
You said you were bored,
so despite your wrists and knees...

77
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,139
Okay, fine. That's enough.

78
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,539
My gosh.

79
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,409
It's sweet.

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,050
Try one. It's sweet.

81
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,889
Come on.

82
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,460
It is sweet.

83
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,430
One more.

84
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:51,000
President Hwang will visit
regarding Richard Han's video call.

85
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,270
Also,

86
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,509
this was delivered to you.

87
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,909
Who is it from?

88
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,610
I do not see the sender.

89
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,520
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

90
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,319
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

91
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,670
Your daughter passed away
six years ago.

92
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,319
It was a hit-and-run accident.

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,699
No.

94
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,779
Your daughter had a son.

95
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,850
"Your daughter had a son."

96
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:14,050
"He was one year old
at the time of her death."

97
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,389
"He's now seven."

98
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,060
Yu Jin had a son?

99
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,959
Yu Jin died, but she left a son?

100
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,930
A seven-year-old? I have a grandson?

101
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:44,920
Why did the chairwoman want
to see you yesterday?

102
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,149
She asked me to start preparing...

103
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:48,990
the mother-daughter therapy tour
I presented at the interview.

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
Hey, you spoke alone with her?

105
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,689
You left a strong impression
on the chairwoman.

106
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,860
You did.

107
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:58,129
Do you also have some unknown history
with the chairwoman?

108
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,170
Anyway,

110
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm sorry for thinking
you got the job by connections.

111
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,769
Me, too.

112
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,110
I can finally tell you this.
I secretly rooted for you...

113
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,639
when you fought over the dress
with Ms. Yoon.

114
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,709
She had been pretty harsh all along.

115
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,009
She was really harsh.

116
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,610
You won, Ha Na.

117
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,420
They're going on and on
without Ms. Yoon here.

118
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,879
Isn't it hard to get used to?

119
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,990
Well, the president
also seems to adore Ha Na.

120
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,389
Maybe there is
some bewitching charm about you.

121
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:30,259
If I had something like that,
I wouldn't be sitting here now.

122
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,600
The president adores me?

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,310
You want me to work with her
on the mother-daughter therapy tour?

124
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,209
Are you asking me
to be her sidekick?

125
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,910
You're the team leader,
not the sidekick.

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,879
The chairwoman has
high expectations,

127
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,610
and you can use this chance
to forget your history with Ms. Goo.

128
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,279
Is she that amazing?

129
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:54,019
You've also become weird
after associating with her recently.

130
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,620
You're always talking about her!

131
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,360
What did you do with her all day
two days ago?

132
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,689
What do you think? Work.

133
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,360
We surveyed tourist spots,
met Hassan,

134
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,899
and went to the police station.

135
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:04,959
The police station? Why?

136
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,769
Did she get in trouble again?

137
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,100
What is it?

138
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,910
My mom brought back the duck soup
she took to your place.

139
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,139
She spilled it in the alley
while carrying it back home.

140
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,850
Wait, why did she take it back?

141
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,579
Was that why you were
at the police station?

142
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,949
Wait, why would that...

143
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,620
Everything got complicated
and stuff happened.

144
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,519
Is she mad?

145
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,829
Are you also mad because of that?

146
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,389
My mom got the ingredients...

147
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,730
from the producers
to make that and...

148
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,670
Forget it.

149
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,240
Gosh, I'm sorry.

150
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,769
I'll visit her on the weekend
and apologize.

151
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,079
I'll get mad at my mom, too.

152
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,779
Don't be so mad. Please?

153
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,649
And stop having
these useless misunderstandings.

154
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,550
I need to go see the chairwoman.

155
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,220
Okay.

156
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,990
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

157
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,490
- This was delivered here?
- Yes, ma'am.

158
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,889
Find the delivery person now.

159
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,959
- Why do you need...
- Now!

160
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,600
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,139
Your daughter had lost her memories
at the time of her disappearance,

162
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,850
so she lived as Lee Du Na.

163
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,750
She lost her memories?

164
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,529
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

165
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,259
- Please check and...
- What?

166
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,509
She lived in a children's home,

167
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,809
then she emigrated to America
with her adoptive parents.

168
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:00,809
"Emigrated?"

169
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,779
I also attached photos of her
from that time,

170
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,580
the ones I found
at the US Immigration Services,

171
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,649
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

172
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,019
Yu Jin. It is you, Yu Jin.

173
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,590
Yu Jin...

174
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,029
- Yu Jin...
- as well as her death certificate.

175
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,470
(Death Certificate, Name: Lee Du Na)

176
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,409
Yu Jin...

177
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,220
(Death Certificate, Name: Lee Du Na)

178
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,610
Your daughter had a son.

179
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,049
Yu Jin had a son?

180
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,149
Ms. Chairwoman?

181
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,120
Ms. Chairwoman!

182
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,129
- Jin Goo.
- Yes, ma'am. I'll get an ambulance.

183
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,000
Put that away first...

184
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,539
(Death Certificate, Name: Lee Du Na)

185
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,509
We'll take her home,
not to the hospital.

186
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,509
Her doctor will be there.

187
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,820
Ms. Chairwoman?

188
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,120
The chairwoman collapsed?

189
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
The chairwoman collapsed,
and the ambulance was here?

190
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,570
Yes, Mr. Hwang
and Ms. Jang went with her.

191
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,570
Which hospital did they go to?

192
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,980
They went back home.

193
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,049
He said her doctor would come home.

194
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,850
If he goes home,
he'll run into his mother.

195
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:18,649
(Mother-in-Law)

196
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,860
(Mom)

197
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,330
Why won't my mom pick up?

198
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,929
(Se Young)

199
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,169
The internal audit would notice
if I suddenly used that much money.

200
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,639
This isn't your first time
creating a slush fund.

201
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,970
Tamper with the sales,

202
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,240
the payroll,
or misappropriate the assets!

203
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,080
You can always find a way.

204
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,549
It's no longer that easy
in this day and age.

205
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,809
Did Ms. Yoon find anything?

206
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,419
Don't touch anything she does.

207
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm already mad enough that
the Dubaian tour got postponed.

208
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,789
Anyway, give me some more time.

209
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,159
And you need to take the call.

210
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,700
- Hey, what is it?
- Mom, you need to go home now.

211
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,799
Aunt Yeo Jin collapsed
and went home.

212
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,539
She collapsed? Why?

213
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,169
I have no idea,
and Jin Goo went with her.

214
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,840
What if he runs into Mother?

215
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,679
She won't even pick up her phone!

216
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,480
(Myung Ji)

217
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,789
Gosh, this is perfect.

218
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,860
I hope the chairwoman eats this
and finds her appetite.

219
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,169
What brings Ms. Jang here
at this hour?

220
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,240
Come inside.

221
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,970
This way, please.

222
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,480
- This way.
- Wait, what happened to her?

223
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,110
My goodness.

224
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,580
- Mom.
- Jin Goo.

225
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,919
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,990
Well, it's...

227
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,659
We'll talk later.

228
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,360
Oh, no.

229
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,970
(Mother-daughter trips)

230
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,230
(Mother-daughter travel destinations
for your bucket list)

231
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,279
I hope she's all right.

232
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,379
I want to be the first guest...

233
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,110
when the mother-daughter
therapy tour begins.

234
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,779
I hope she stays healthy
to find her daughter...

235
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,950
and travel with her.

236
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,429
Jin Goo will blow up if he finds out
Mother has been our maid all along.

237
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,399
Things are just getting worse
from the duck soup incident.

238
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,669
Ms. Yoon,
is the chairwoman all right?

239
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,100
Why do you want to know?

240
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,970
You're only a contract worker,
so know your place.

241
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,309
Why did she call you yesterday?

242
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,379
You need to report back
after such meetings!

243
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,379
She wanted to hear more about
the mother-daughter therapy tour.

244
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,250
She wanted to be the first guest
as soon as the tour began.

245
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,590
"The first guest?"

246
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,789
Does she want to do this
with Yu Jin?

247
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,159
Anything else?

248
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:21,070
She encouraged me
and bid me good luck.

249
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,700
So, while we're on the subject,

250
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,169
you must know
the chairwoman very well.

251
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,139
Is there something
she wants to do with her daughter...

252
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,309
Wait. I'm still thinking.

253
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,850
Right. Also,

254
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,649
I hope to have our team
join this tour proposal.

255
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,649
I'm still figuring it out,
so stop acting up and wait!

256
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,789
Yes, then I'll wait.

257
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,600
She's even considering
going on a trip with Yu Jin?

258
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,500
Did she get an update about her?

259
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,570
If it was good news,
she wouldn't have collapsed.

260
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,309
Everything looks fine.

261
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:05,779
Her low blood pressure
could worsen with stress,

262
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,580
so she needs
as much rest as she can get.

263
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,779
Please call me right away
if anything happens.

264
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,320
- Yes, thank you.
- Goodbye.

265
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,500
It was a death certificate.

266
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,600
Was it her daughter's?

267
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,470
Ms. Chairwoman, are you okay?

268
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:34,769
Jin Goo.

269
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,570
You should stay in bed.

270
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,580
What about the files on my desk?

271
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,690
I have it here.

272
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,159
I brought everything,
including the letter.

273
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,990
Did you see it?

274
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,700
I got a glance
at the death certificate...

275
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,259
and the photos.

276
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:04,940
By any chance, was it your daughter?

277
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,200
More verification is due,

278
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,110
but I think it's her.

279
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,879
She died two years ago...

280
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,549
in a hit-and-run accident.

281
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,759
Ms. Chairwoman...

282
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,860
Yu Jin...

283
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,799
Chairwoman Shin received mail
from a delivery service...

284
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,539
and collapsed after reading it.

285
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,509
(Security Department's Office)

286
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,980
What about the delivery service?

287
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,049
I looked into it,
and the deliveryman seemed odd.

288
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,149
- "Odd?"
- I tracked him from the lobby,

289
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,250
but he disappeared
into a blind spot...

290
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,759
of the CCTV
after leaving through a side door.

291
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,389
He wasn't seen
coming in on a motorcycle, either.

292
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,259
It seemed like he was
familiar with the hotel's layout.

293
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:03,789
What's weirder is this.

294
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,970
He had been watching
while Chairwoman Shin left on a gurney.

295
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,339
He must've been waiting on purpose
to see her there.

296
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,109
Did he expect
the chairwoman to collapse?

297
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,079
Probably. If the news was enough
to make her collapse,

298
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,650
it must've been
about her daughter or husband,

299
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,880
and this man came with it.

300
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,349
Her husband left for America
ten years ago.

301
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,619
Find out if he came back recently.

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,369
Attorney Ko, can we meet?

303
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,839
Can you...

304
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,809
keep this letter a secret
until I disclose it?

305
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,980
Yes, I'll do that.

306
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,619
I trust you, Jin Goo.

307
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,420
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

308
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,000
Ms. Chairwoman, are you all right?

309
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,329
Have you looked into it?

310
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,740
Yes, I looked up the visitor log
and the delivery service,

311
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,509
but his number
and business did not exist.

312
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,869
I also checked the CCTV footage
with the security department,

313
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,880
but it was hard to make out his face
behind his helmet.

314
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,950
We'll have to look into the CCTVs
out on the street.

315
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,779
I'll ask the police for cooperation.

316
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,420
It was Sung Ho.

317
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,589
He read the e-mail yesterday
and sent this as his reply.

318
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,589
But you should make sure...

319
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,059
It was him. I know it.

320
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,960
He'd always leave a sticker...

321
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,900
on the letters he wrote.

322
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,500
I need you two to help me.

323
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,069
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,440
Ms. Jang, find out
if the death certificate is genuine...

325
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,509
and look more into this
hit-and-run accident.

326
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,779
Yes, ma'am.

327
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,680
Jin Goo, go to the children's home
Yu Jin stayed at...

328
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,049
before she moved to America
and find out about Lee Du Na.

329
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,759
If Lee Du Na is Yu Jin,

330
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,630
then Yu Jin has a son.

331
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,099
"A son?"

332
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,829
If that is Yu Jin,

333
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,500
it means I have a grandson.

334
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,640
Do you know where he lives
and who he is?

335
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,170
All I know is that
he's seven years old.

336
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,779
His safety is important,
so make your moves discreetly.

337
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,150
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:39,680
Once again,
let me ask the two of you.

339
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,250
No one can find out about this...

340
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,059
other than the three of us.

341
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,990
Keep it quiet even from Se Young
and her mother for a while.

342
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,759
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

343
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:01,410
I heard the chairwoman collapsed.

344
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:02,970
I talked to Dr. Hong on the phone.

345
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:04,539
Is she all right?

346
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,039
Wait, she's asleep.

347
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,880
She needs to rest,

348
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,579
so please refrain
from talking to her today.

349
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,279
Is that so?

350
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,690
Why did she suddenly go into shock?

351
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,119
She's getting older.

352
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,220
I need to talk to my mother.

353
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,829
Yes, your mother came
to make some fresh kimchi...

354
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,640
The family I worked for
gave me a vacation,

355
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,339
and I didn't want to sit at home.

356
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,109
I can look after the chairwoman
with this chance.

357
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,470
Take the apron off, Mom.

358
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,740
Jin Goo, I'll leave
after I make this abalone porridge.

359
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,549
She needs to eat something
when she wakes up.

360
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,650
What about the help who works here?

361
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:51,559
She's on a vacation, too.

362
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,759
We also don't want my in-law
working in our kitchen.

363
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,829
It's awkward for both of us,
but what can we do?

364
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,400
The chairwoman
only likes what she makes.

365
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,269
If anyone is to blame,
it's Ms. Sim's good cooking.

366
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,200
I should be grateful
that she liked...

367
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,069
the food that I cooked.

368
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,339
I'm glad I can repay her
in this way...

369
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,680
Are you their maid?

370
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,349
Mr. Hwang, how can you
talk to her like that?

371
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,920
Would we make her work as our maid?

372
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,589
She came to do this voluntarily,
and I couldn't stop her.

373
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:27,390
She'll just make
the abalone porridge,

374
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,960
so I'll get her a cab after that
and send her home.

375
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,730
She had to bring the duck soup back
because you didn't eat it.

376
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,269
Well, you know,

377
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,799
the chairwoman collapsed,
so everything was hectic.

378
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:43,740
Bang Ul, why did you take it back?

379
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,609
We would've eaten it
if you left it here.

380
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:49,150
I guess so.
I should've thought it through.

381
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,720
Mr. Hwang, don't make us sound like
such disrespectful people.

382
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,349
We'll be family soon.

383
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,490
Mom, take a photo of yourself
in the taxi and send it to me.

384
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,900
- Don't take the bus.
- Okay. Fine.

385
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,670
You won't find a better son
than President Hwang.

386
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,900
Bang Ul... I mean, Ms. Sim.

387
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,440
I don't know about everything else,

388
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,680
but you're blessed
with the greatest son ever.

389
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,079
That's true.

390
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,750
How's Chairwoman Shin?

391
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,890
She went into shock under hypotension,
but she got better.

392
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:31,190
She couldn't recover that easily...

393
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,960
from the news
of the daughter's death.

394
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,890
- Is Mr. Hwang back yet?
- Not yet.

395
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,329
Ms. Jang just returned.

396
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,029
Ms. Jang came, but Mr. Hwang didn't?

397
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,900
It must be so important
that he forgot about our meeting.

398
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,710
May I have the number
of the director nun...

399
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,839
while Ms. Lee Du Na was here?

400
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,279
She emigrated to Canada
five years ago.

401
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,650
I can give you
her contact information,

402
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,279
but we can't reach her, either.

403
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,619
And the staff from that time
isn't around here anymore.

404
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,289
If I may ask,

405
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,930
what is your relationship
with Ms. Lee?

406
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,190
Well, I'm not her family,

407
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,900
- but I'm an acquaintance of hers...
- If you aren't her family,

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,500
I cannot give you information
about Ms. Lee.

409
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:20,000
Even if her family came and asked,
we couldn't give them anything...

410
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,569
because the files were
lost in a fire.

411
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:26,380
I see. Is there any other way?

412
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,650
I expected her to be in shock,

413
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,049
but I hoped she'd stay strong
with the news of Yu Jin's son.

414
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,990
The news must be painful,

415
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,990
but it must be comforting...

416
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,319
to know about her grandson
while she grieves her late daughter.

417
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:44,130
Ms. Goo tried to adopt Eun Chong,

418
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,400
but it didn't go too well.

419
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,200
Her history
and financial situation...

420
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,799
must make it difficult
for her to do so.

421
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,369
Will it be possible if she had
enough financial resources?

422
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,670
I want Eun Chong to be
a part of my or Ms. Goo's family...

423
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,940
before he starts school.

424
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,640
If you and Ms. Shin would
become her patrons,

425
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,980
then it'd be possible for her.

426
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,279
- Please find a way.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,950
I got a call from the children's home
on our way here.

428
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,750
President Hwang Jin Goo came
and asked about Lee Du Na.

429
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,660
He went there, just as I expected.

430
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,119
Did he ask her about Eun Chong?

431
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,789
No, it looks like Chairwoman Shin is
making discreet moves.

432
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,069
I was worried it'd reach Goo Ha Na
through Hwang Jin Goo.

433
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,769
Then, Eun Chong's existence would
come out in the open right away.

434
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:28,470
Yes, sir.

435
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,480
She'll also prioritize
Eun Chong's safety.

436
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,009
Mr. Hwang must be trustworthy,
so let's keep an eye on him.

437
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,250
Eun Chong,
your aunt can't adopt you anymore...

438
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,720
because her wedding is off.

439
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,519
Tae Hoon, you need to stop!

440
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,730
It's true.
It must be so sad to have no mom.

441
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,130
My auntie is my mommy!

442
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,299
How many times do I have to say it?
Are you stupid?

443
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,930
No, you're stupid!

444
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,940
How can your auntie
become your mommy?

445
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,339
My auntie will become my mommy!

446
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,710
I'll find my grandma, too!

447
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,880
Liar. You say that,
but nothing happens!

448
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,140
I'm not lying!

449
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,650
Stop it!

450
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,119
- No, you stop it!
- Hey, stop fighting!

451
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,250
Stop it. You have to stop!

452
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,259
No, you stop first!

453
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,690
Teacher!

454
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,359
- No, you stop first!
- Whatever!

455
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,690
Hey!

456
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,400
Boys, stop it. Break it off.

457
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,730
You shouldn't fight each other.

458
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,839
Are you okay, Eun Chong?

459
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,200
Santa...

460
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,809
Boys, why are you two fighting?

461
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,380
Oh, my. Hello.

462
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,809
What brings you here?

463
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,579
I was just passing by,
and I saw the two in a fight.

464
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,650
I see.

465
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,650
Eun Chong and Tae Hoon,
why did you fight?

466
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,390
You should be good friends.

467
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,319
Eun Chong pushed me.

468
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,619
I'll tell my grandma about you!

469
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,059
You teased me first
and said I had no mommy!

470
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,130
I said I'd find my grandma,

471
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,960
but you called that a lie!

472
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,039
Were the boys hurt?

473
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,609
I see.

474
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,880
So, why did they get into a fight?

475
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,009
I understand.

476
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,980
His uncle will be there soon.

477
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,119
Goodbye.

478
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,529
Ms. Goo, why do you make so many
personal calls during working hours?

479
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,259
I'm sorry. It was from my nephew's
kindergarten, so I had to take it.

480
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,200
This wasn't the first time
you used him as an excuse.

481
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,500
Does he always go around
causing trouble?

482
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:40,500
Start an aunt-nephew therapy
instead of the mother-daughter.

483
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,809
Do you think you're all that...

484
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,970
because the chairwoman
gave you some attention?

485
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,410
If the contact with Dubai
gets called off, you'll get fired,

486
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,950
and that'll be the end
of your mother-daughter therapy tour.

487
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,609
Know your stuff
before you start acting up.

488
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,150
Are you going to fight her?

489
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,190
But the president isn't here.
What are you going to do?

490
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,920
Ha Na, stay patient.

491
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,190
Who wants coffee?

492
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,329
It's on Me.

493
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,130
Me.

494
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,529
Okay. One, two, three.

495
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,700
Where are you, Jin Goo?
Are you not coming back to the office?

496
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,329
I have a meeting with another hotel.

497
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,970
I need to get this contract.

498
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,140
Do you think it'll happen?

499
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,539
There's about a 50-percent chance.

500
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:18,579
Why did Aunt Yeo Jin
suddenly collapse?

501
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:19,839
I told you. It was hypotension.

502
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,380
I'm sure there's a reason behind
her low blood pressure.

503
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,279
(Lee Ha Na, Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na)

504
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,680
Se Young, I need to hang up.

505
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,150
(Lee Ha Na, Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na)

506
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,250
(Lee Du Na)

507
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,250
Lee Du Na?

508
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,089
That's the chairwoman's daughter.

509
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,230
Lee Ha Na, Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na.

510
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:37,630
(Lee Ha Na, Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na)

511
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,960
Ha Na, Du Na, and Se Na?

512
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,269
Why did he hang up
at such an important moment?

513
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,700
Why did she
suddenly go into hypotension?

514
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,940
Is Mr. Hwang
at the chairwoman's place?

515
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,509
No, he's out working.

516
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,680
I heard the chairwoman's condition
stabilized.

517
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,579
Why did she collapse?

518
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,450
I don't know.

519
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,519
Has she heard an update
on her husband...

520
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,319
or her daughter?

521
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,789
I do not wish to answer questions
irrelevant to work.

522
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,529
How do you know
if this is relevant or irrelevant?

523
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,130
I asked a work-related question,
but you took it as a personal one.

524
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,269
Or do you have nothing to say
because you don't know?

525
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,369
It looked like she collapsed
after something was delivered to her.

526
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,970
"Delivered?"

527
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,039
You didn't know?

528
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,339
Find out what came in the delivery
and let me know.

529
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,650
- I want to know.
- Why do you want to know?

530
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,819
I want to know
the stuff you want to know.

531
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,160
Something was delivered to her,
then she collapsed?

532
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,160
What was delivered to her?

533
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,900
Could it be a file
related to the DNA test?

534
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,269
Yes, things have been quiet
in that front lately.

535
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,809
She had been frantic about sending
the DNA sample to the NFS.

536
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,180
Okay. Let's hang up for now.

537
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:03,950
Lee Du Na.

538
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,619
That was the name you lived under.

539
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,390
How was your life?

540
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,519
Did you meet great foster parents...

541
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,690
and receive lots of love?

542
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,960
You lost your memories
and couldn't return to your mommy.

543
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,359
You poor thing.

544
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,440
Yeo Jin.

545
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,579
Was that the file she received?

546
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,549
Are you okay?

547
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,680
Se Young said you collapsed
after something was delivered.

548
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:43,750
Yes, it was a threatening letter.

549
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:46,319
"A threatening letter?"

550
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,460
There still are people
who want to slander me.

551
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,259
I wouldn't have flinched
in the old days,

552
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,099
but I must be getting older.

553
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,430
You need to find out
who sent that to you.

554
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,230
You should've set an example
with that man...

555
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,000
at the head director's inauguration
by locking him up behind bars.

556
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,309
Jin Goo saved you many times,

557
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,180
both back then and even today.

558
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,180
You're right.

559
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,319
You should have some porridge
before you take your medicine.

560
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,019
Have you been crying?

561
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,519
It was because I just woke up.

562
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,460
Are you all right?

563
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,069
Yes. You can leave it here and go.

564
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,900
Okay.

565
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,869
Let me know if you need anything.

566
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,450
- Did you look into it?
- Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

567
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,589
I confirmed the authenticity
of the death certificate.

568
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,490
Six years ago,
Ms. Lee Du Na passed away...

569
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,160
in a hit-and-run accident
at Siwang Intersection.

570
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,130
It's true.

571
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,529
Ms. Chairwoman.

572
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,799
Continue.

573
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,210
The driver was never caught.

574
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,380
The case
remained unresolved to this day.

575
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:15,710
"Unresolved?"

576
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,250
It looked like
she was on the verge of tears.

577
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,119
What could she have received?
She hid it as soon as I walked in.

578
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:26,289
And why is Ms. Jang here?

579
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,329
- What are you doing?
- My gosh.

580
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,130
- Are you going home?
- Were you eavesdropping?

581
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,000
"Eavesdropping?"

582
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:39,400
Don't make me seem weird.

583
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,599
Did she eat her porridge?

584
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,970
She told me to leave it and go.

585
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,509
You should go.
Great work today, Bang Ul.

586
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:46,240
You have to grab a cab for me,

587
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:47,740
and I have to take a photo.

588
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,349
Please have a good talk
with Jin Goo.

589
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:55,750
Make sure
he doesn't get suspicious anymore.

590
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,190
Bang Ul. Come on.

591
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,059
Bang Ul.

592
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,430
The hit-and-run accident was already
suspicious, but it was unresolved?

593
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,059
Could it be a coincidence?

594
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,460
The accident was...

595
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,470
Hey, Jin Goo.

596
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,109
You found no document
related to Lee Du Na?

597
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,339
No, they lost everything in a fire.

598
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,549
The director nun of that time
now lives in Canada,

599
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:25,750
so it's not easy to reach her.

600
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,720
But I'll keep trying.

601
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,720
Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident
remained unresolved to this day,

602
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,319
and there are no files
on Lee Du Na, either?

603
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,589
The hit-and-run accident
was unresolved?

604
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:37,630
Yes, Jin Goo.

605
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,299
This doesn't seem like an accident.

606
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,430
Should I look more into
the hit-and-run accident?

607
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,170
I need to find my grandson first.

608
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,599
Then, I'll find Sung Ho, too.

609
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,309
(Cinderella Game)

610
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:32,150
Both the hit-and-run accident
and the DNA contamination are weird.

611
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,279
How can I guarantee
my grandson's safety?

612
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,289
I just can't tell.

613
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,150
Her quick recovery seems odd.

614
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,259
What if she heard both bad news
and good news at the same time?

615
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,990
Are you Lee Eun Chong?

616
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,329
I need to find my grandson
right now.

617
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,299
I'll do every possible thing I can
to find him.

618
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,029
Find someone who's good with safes.

619
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,299
Please tell me
where our grandson is.
