1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,509
You found no document
related to Lee Du Na?

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,750
No, they lost everything in a fire.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,820
The director nun of that time
now lives in Canada,

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,250
so it's not easy to reach her.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,260
But I'll keep trying.

9
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,929
Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident
remained unresolved to this day,

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,460
and there are no files
on Lee Du Na, either?

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,030
The hit-and-run accident
was unresolved?

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,230
Yes, Jin Goo.

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,769
This doesn't seem like an accident.

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,710
Should I look more into
the hit-and-run accident?

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,369
I need to find my grandson first.

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,240
Then, I'll find Sung Ho, too.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,719
I told Ms. Jang to look up
the IP address for the e-mail.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,049
And Jin Goo.

19
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,320
This is
only between the three of us.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,060
You cannot share this with Se Young.

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,689
I won't. Please don't worry.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,390
Please feel free to call me anytime.

23
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,299
Goodbye.

24
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,429
The case was unresolved?

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,599
But they always catch
hit-and-run drivers.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,239
Is Eun Chong all right?

27
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,950
I should meet with Tae Hoon's mother
and have a talk.

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,150
Bye.

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,019
- Mr. Hwang.
- Hop in.

30
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,629
I'm just around the corner.

31
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,730
It's a cold day.

32
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,900
Then, please excuse me.

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,040
Right, is the chairwoman all right?

34
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,709
- Yes.
- What a relief.

35
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,840
Why was she unwell?

36
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,549
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,450
I'm only a contract worker,
so I must know my place.

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,620
Don't say that.

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,920
She has low blood pressure.

40
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,629
Yesterday, she said
she wanted to be the first guest...

41
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:04,030
for the mother-daughter
therapy tour.

42
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,799
I hope she stays healthy
to find her daughter...

43
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,469
and travel with her, too.

44
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,240
She said that?

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,710
She'll probably be completely well
as soon as she finds her daughter.

46
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,340
- I hope she finds her soon.
- I agree.

47
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,210
How's the back of your hand?

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,719
Did it leave a scar?

49
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,219
No, it looked smooth,

50
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,219
thanks to the ointment
and bandage you gave me.

51
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,490
I'm glad.

52
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,590
Did Ms. Yoon apologize?

53
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,259
She's a stubborn one, isn't she?

54
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:38,659
I'll talk to her again...

55
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,270
It doesn't mean anything
to receive an empty apology.

56
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,840
I don't want a forced gesture.
It's all right.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,870
I'm now a boss
who doesn't keep his promise.

58
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,909
You can treat me to another meal.

59
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:54,110
Is that good enough?

60
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,449
- How about meat?
- Think of the menu.

61
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,319
Okay.

62
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,129
Thank you.

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,490
Have a safe trip home.

64
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,860
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

65
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,379
Are you Lee Eun Chong?

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,180
Yes.

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,620
I'm Tae Hoon's grandmother.

68
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,150
He said you hit him today.

69
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,389
Tae Hoon teased me first
about how I had no mommy.

70
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,189
I talked to him,
and he said it was true!

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,229
What are you saying
while the kid is listening?

72
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,569
Auntie Ha Na...

73
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,699
Ha Na, I'm sorry.
My mother-in-law...

74
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,509
If you were going to raise him
instead of his mom,

75
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,110
you should've done a better job.

76
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,240
What on earth did you do
to make him go around beating others?

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,610
What kind of monster will he become?

78
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,210
I apologize that he hit him.

79
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,879
But Eun Chong doesn't hit others
for no reason.

80
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,250
Did you just mean
he deserved to be beaten?

81
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,419
Listen to yourself.
This was why he never learned any better.

82
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,689
You hit him last time
and made him scrape his knee,

83
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,189
and you hit him again today!

84
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,529
Don't you know
he's a third-generation only son?

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,870
Apologize to Tae Hoon. Now!

86
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,240
Ma'am, I apologize that he hit him.

87
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,870
I'll teach him properly and make sure
it doesn't happen again,

88
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,509
but you also have to teach Tae Hoon
to watch his mouth.

89
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,040
"Watch his mouth?"

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,879
He's the only kid
who teases Eun Chong...

91
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,850
about how he has no mother.

92
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,149
This wasn't the first time.

93
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,089
There are many kids in this world
who have no mother.

94
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,519
It was nothing to be teased for.

95
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:45,990
I know he's a kid, but...

96
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,589
I'm sorry, Ha Na.

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,529
Why do you keep apologizing to her?

98
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,459
Weren't you concerned
about how your son was beaten?

99
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,699
He goes around getting beaten
because you're always like this!

100
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,399
Good grief. This is so frustrating.

101
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,769
Who cares if he has a mom?
He's worse off than a kid without...

102
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,240
Gosh, darn it. It's so frustrating.

103
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,709
Tae Hoon, you started this.

104
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,910
It's a really bad habit...

105
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,920
to say only the things
that hurt your friend very deeply.

106
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,490
Grandma, Mommy...

107
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,689
You little punk.
Stop trying to teach him.

108
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,420
Tae Hoon is
our third-generation only son!

109
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,230
You should be grateful
that he'd associate with you.

110
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,300
You better thank me for coming here
instead of the police station!

111
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,230
Do you want to take this
to the police station?

112
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,870
What?

113
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,009
I recorded everything you just said.

114
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,240
If you continue,
I'll report you for child abuse.

115
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,240
President Hwang...

116
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,149
I didn't even hit him!
How is this child abuse?

117
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,079
If you hit him,
you'll receive additional punishment.

118
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,689
If your child is dear to you,
then so is Eun Chong to his family.

119
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,560
Please leave...

120
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,620
before I add trespassing
to my report.

121
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,589
Mother, let's go.

122
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,860
Ma'am, you need to apologize
to Eun Chong before you go.

123
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,199
I've never heard anyone...

124
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,639
demanding me to apologize
to a little kid.

125
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,269
Let's go, Tae Hoon.
This is ridiculous.

126
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,740
I'm sorry, Ha Na.

127
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,240
Goodness.

128
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,920
Auntie Ha Na...

129
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,120
Is it that hard
for an adult to apologize to a kid?

130
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,959
It was easy for me.

131
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,129
There are many adults
who can't do that.

132
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,629
Right. What brings you here,
Mr. Hwang?

133
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,560
You left this in my car.

134
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,829
I was really out of it.

135
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,170
Thank you.

136
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,810
And thank you for your help
just now.

137
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,540
Thank you.

138
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:50,079
Don't let people's words hurt you.

139
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,379
I won't.

140
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,550
Mr. Hwang, one moment.

141
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:01,060
Mr. President,
do you have a girlfriend?

142
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,189
What?

143
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,670
These are
handmade confectionary and cookies.

144
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,540
I frequent many stores
thanks to my good sales record.

145
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,509
I got this from someone
who has a business in Insa-dong.

146
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:18,939
You should share it
with your mother.

147
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,980
Gosh, this is such a treat.

148
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,579
Thank you.

149
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,480
Bye.

150
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,920
See you tomorrow.

151
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,449
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

152
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,060
"I recorded
everything you just said."

153
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,100
"If you continue,
I'll report you for child abuse."

154
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,569
Mr. Hwang said that.

155
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,370
"If your child is dear to you,
then so is Eun Chong to his family."

156
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,839
And... What else?

157
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,180
"Please leave
before I add trespassing..."

158
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,420
Bingo!

159
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,319
Wait, what is that?

160
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,550
You weren't allowed to enter
people's houses without permission.

161
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,189
I would've taught her
a cooler lesson if I were around.

162
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,699
But Mr. Hwang has got it going on!

163
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,300
He's really cool!

164
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,000
Eun Chong, let's wash up. Come on.

165
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,540
That young lady must be
clever, friendly,

166
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,310
and good at her job.

167
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,879
She received something like this
from her associates.

168
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,610
She's my subordinate,
but I have a lot to learn from her.

169
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,279
And she lives with her nephew.

170
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,120
It's not easy
to find a woman like her.

171
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,250
Is he her older sister's son
or her younger sister's?

172
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,090
- Her friend's son.
- "Her friend?"

173
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,889
- She's raising her friend's son?
- Isn't that amazing?

174
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,289
Eun Chong said
both his parents passed,

175
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,429
so I said it was a relief
that he had his auntie.

176
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,500
But she wasn't his actual aunt,
but his mom's friend?

177
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:49,799
My goodness.

178
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,000
This is something you see on TV.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,539
- Something on "Screening Humanity."
- She should go on the show.

180
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:55,840
Who knows?

181
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,840
She may hear about his grandmother.

182
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,039
Should I tell her?

183
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,480
Anyway, why did
the chairwoman collapse?

184
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,549
Did she hear news
about her daughter?

185
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,820
No, it was
just because of low blood pressure.

186
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,090
And the reason why
she has low blood pressure...

187
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,759
must be because of her daughter.

188
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,529
If it was a threatening letter,
why would she hide that?

189
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,100
And it seemed like
she had been crying.

190
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,970
Aunt Yeo Jin was crying?

191
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,970
Could she have heard
that Yu Jin was dead?

192
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,610
Really?

193
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,169
No.

194
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:33,909
If that was what she heard,
she wouldn't have just collapsed.

195
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,710
If it made her cry,
could it be Uncle Sung Ho?

196
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,919
Why would she cry over a husband...

197
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,320
whom she hasn't heard from
for 20 years?

198
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,019
Ms. Jang and Jin Goo must know.

199
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,629
- Ask Jin Goo...
- He won't tell me, either.

200
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,029
He keeps saying
it was her low blood pressure.

201
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,029
Jin Goo, that punk.
I need to deal with him first.

202
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,600
He acts more like
Yeo Jin's son-in-law than mine.

203
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,570
Should I install
a location-tracking app?

204
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,639
Can you do that?

205
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,379
It's kind of difficult
because of security,

206
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,850
but I'll find a way.

207
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,220
You should get changed
and come downstairs.

208
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,629
Both the hit-and-run accident
and the DNA contamination are weird.

209
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,600
Did someone
hurt Yu Jin on purpose...

210
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,370
No, that can't be right.

211
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,539
If that really is the case,
then how can I guarantee...

212
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,740
Yu Jin's son, my grandson's safety?

213
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,860
You delivered that file to me,
didn't you?

214
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,289
Tell me where my grandson is
right now.

215
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:56,629
Stop hiding yourself.
Come and talk to me!

216
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,929
Disclose everything
behind Yu Jin's accident...

217
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,100
and the DNA contamination!

218
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,629
Why won't you show up?
How can I handle this all alone?

219
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,600
Do you want to see me
collapse and die?

220
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,470
Yu Jin is dead,

221
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,710
but if her son is alive,
why won't you show up?

222
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,179
Sung Ho, let's meet.
Let's meet in person and talk.

223
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,789
Yu Jin is no longer with us,
but we have her son.

224
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,360
We have to discuss
how we'll protect him from now on.

225
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,320
You’ve seen him, right?

226
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,929
Our grandson is nearby, isn't he?

227
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,629
I want to meet him, too.

228
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,500
I want to touch him
and hold him in my arms.

229
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,500
Please tell me
where our grandson is.

230
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,970
Sung Ho, please.

231
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,549
It's hard to tell.

232
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,049
She couldn't have heard
that Yu Jin died,

233
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,620
and she also couldn't have heard
that she was found.

234
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,519
What's something that can be
moderately sad and okay?

235
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,960
Something that's shocking enough
to make her collapse,

236
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,090
but it's something
that can help her go on.

237
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,159
Maybe she found Yu Jin
at a hospital.

238
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,399
She might be irreparably
or terminally ill.

239
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,169
Then, she would've gone
to the hospital...

240
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,039
and began a whole campaign
to save her.

241
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,679
Then, what could it be?

242
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,809
She's coming out.

243
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,620
Yeo Jin, did you need
to look at something urgently?

244
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,049
You weren't in good condition,
so you should rest.

245
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,519
Let's eat dinner.

246
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,389
I don't have an appetite.

247
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,830
It's not a good idea
to be on an empty stomach.

248
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,929
You'll end up collapsing again.

249
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,129
And the business can't benefit
if people keep hearing...

250
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,299
about your collapses.

251
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,399
You love abalone porridge.

252
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,000
You'll find some energy
after you finish a hot bowl.

253
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,070
Come and eat with us, Aunt Yeo Jin.

254
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,980
Yes, I need to eat
and find more energy...

255
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,580
to find my grandson.

256
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,659
I'm sitting here eating food
after losing my child.

257
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,590
How can I call myself her mother?

258
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,559
My daughter died
such a tragic death.

259
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,929
What's wrong, Yeo Jin?

260
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,570
I can't eat anymore.

261
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,169
Were you that shocked
because of that threatening letter?

262
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,840
Do you want some calming pills?

263
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,539
No, I need to rest.
Don't come into my room.

264
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,080
Okay. Get a good rest.

265
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,649
Get a good rest, Aunt Yeo Jin.

266
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,990
I just can't tell.

267
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,659
We could find out
if we saw that file.

268
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,360
Where could she have left it?

269
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,799
If it was that important,
it must be in her safe.

270
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,110
Yu Jin.

271
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:00,279
Mommy was such a fool.

272
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,779
I had no idea you were in America,

273
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,250
that you passed in an accident,

274
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,759
and that you had a son.

275
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,059
I was such a fool.

276
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,700
Yu Jin.

277
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,940
Where's your son?

278
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,039
Where is he?

279
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,350
Please.

280
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,519
Please come to my dream
and tell me where he is.

281
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,789
Yu Jin...

282
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,480
Sung Ho, let's meet.
Let's meet in person and talk.

283
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,389
Yu Jin is no longer with us,

284
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,789
but we have her son.

285
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:21,029
We have to discuss
how we'll protect him from now on.

286
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,889
You've seen him, right?

287
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,500
Our grandson is nearby, isn't he?

288
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,799
I want to meet him, too.

289
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,570
I want to touch him
and hold him in my arms.

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,340
Please tell me
where our grandson is.

291
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,769
Sung Ho, please.

292
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,120
He read the e-mail,
but he wouldn't reply.

293
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,090
If he doesn't reply this time,
I won't ever see him again.

294
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,190
It's really over.

295
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm sure he will.

296
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,159
Did you hear anything back
about his IP address?

297
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,460
They'll get back to me
either today or tomorrow.

298
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,929
Ms. Chairwoman, I saw this drawing
at the children's home yesterday.

299
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,840
It's titled, "Three Friends."

300
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,370
and it says, "Lee Ha Na.
Lee Du Na, and Lee Se Na."

301
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,840
"Lee Du Na?"

302
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,309
"Lee Ha Na, Lee Du Na..."

303
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,450
Yu Jin drew this.

304
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,720
- Do you recognize it?
- Of course.

305
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,549
She used to draw like this
when she was ten.

306
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,460
Yu Jin...

307
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,830
Jin Goo.

308
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,000
I need to visit this place.

309
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,470
There's no record
of her husband returning to Korea?

310
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,240
No, he never came back
after he left for America ten years ago.

311
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,610
I'm still confirming
his whereabouts in America.

312
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,509
If it wasn't him,
it could be someone he hired.

313
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,450
Where was Hwang Jin Goo yesterday?

314
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,879
He left the chairwoman's place
with Ms. Jang,

315
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,419
but he didn't return to the office.

316
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,019
Get more detail
about his whereabouts yesterday.

317
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:59,460
Yes, sir.

318
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,869
How do you feel?

319
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:12,539
I was quite concerned after hearing about
your collapse yesterday.

320
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
I'm fine. Goodbye.

321
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,049
Hwang Jin Goo must've forgotten
all about his meeting with me.

322
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,150
Yes, sir.

323
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,660
It was already surprising
to see her back at work...

324
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,690
after her shock and collapse
in just one day,

325
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,259
so where could she be headed
in such a hurry?

326
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,029
If she heard about her daughter's death,
it must be related to her.

327
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,470
Her quick recovery seems odd.

328
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,000
What if she heard both bad news
and good news at the same time?

329
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,269
That could be the case.

330
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,839
What was the bad news,
and what was the good news?

331
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,509
She was adopted here...

332
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,309
and emigrated to America
with her foster parents.

333
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,690
The girl who drew this is Lee Du Na.

334
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,519
Does anyone have more information
about Lee Ha Na and Lee Se Na,

335
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,019
the other two in the title?

336
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,960
As I already mentioned yesterday,

337
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,730
we did not have files
related to Lee Ha Na and Lee Se Na,

338
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,930
and I had only been here
for five years.

339
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:23,640
May I take this drawing?

340
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,880
If it was your daughter's,
you should take it.

341
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,309
Thank you.

342
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,779
By any chance,

343
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,650
how many seven-year-old boys
do you have here?

344
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,819
We have 3 boys who are 7 years old.

345
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,630
Are their parents all alive?

346
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,390
When did they come here?

347
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,829
May I see their photos...

348
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,269
No, may I see them?

349
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:50,029
Where are they right now?

350
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,099
Ms. Chairwoman.

351
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,880
Why is she hiding that file
this securely?

352
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,690
It's probably in there.

353
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,460
Could the passcode be
Yu Jin's birthday?

354
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,599
Wrong passcode.

355
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,670
Yeo Jin's birthday.

356
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,940
Wrong passcode.

357
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,640
It wouldn't be something
that obvious.

358
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,250
You did not enter the passcode
within the allotted time.

359
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,819
Yes, what is it?

360
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,059
Yeo Jin left with Jin Goo?

361
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,160
I asked where he was going,
and he said he'd tell me after.

362
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,859
What does she need to do so urgently
after collapsing?

363
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:53,460
Okay. Bye.

364
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,670
Hey, Detective Cho.
We need to meet for a moment.

365
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,910
What were you doing in there?

366
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,349
What? I ventilated her room.

367
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,619
I wasn't banned from going in there.

368
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,920
It's like you're suspicious of me.

369
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,519
I was just asking.

370
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,759
Did you do something
to cause suspicion?

371
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,630
Bang Ul. I mean, Ms. Sim.

372
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,259
Don't be so low.

373
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,559
You should watch your mouth.

374
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,299
Why would you say I was low
in this situation?

375
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,500
It's even weirder
to see you get so mad.

376
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,269
You have a knack
for making me feel riled up.

377
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,440
And the same to you.

378
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,839
My gosh.

379
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,809
You never let anything go, do you?

380
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:42,980
My gosh.

381
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,220
Right. Last night...

382
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,650
Did the chairwoman spill water?

383
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,319
I emptied her trash can yesterday,

384
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,789
but it was
already full of wet tissue.

385
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,299
Someone delivered a file to her,

386
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,799
and she collapsed after seeing that.

387
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,400
But you said she seemed fine today.

388
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,769
That's why it's more confusing.

389
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,799
What's something that makes her
moderately sad yet okay?

390
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,609
What could it be?

391
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,579
"Moderately sad?"

392
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,880
Hey, you won't come up
with anything useful,

393
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,980
so I need to open her safe.

394
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,250
Find someone who's good with safes.

395
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,349
I know lots of technicians,

396
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,190
but can you bring them
into your home?

397
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,359
Well, I need to find a day
when she isn't around.

398
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,059
But her schedule isn't regular,
so I can't guarantee anything.

399
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,769
It's not like I can steal her safe.

400
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,299
Should I make it look like theft?

401
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:43,009
And were you sure...

402
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:46,579
no one asked
about the hit-and-run accident?

403
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:48,180
Yes.

404
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,650
She doesn't even know
if her daughter is alive or dead.

405
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,579
I'll find someone good with safes
and call you.

406
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:55,849
Find your best man.

407
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,859
Also, I need to install...

408
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,859
a location-tracking app
on Jin Goo's phone.

409
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,529
Red light, green light.

410
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,970
Red light, green light.

411
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,140
Red light, green light.

412
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,140
Red light, green light.

413
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,490
- Red light, green light.
- Red light, green light.

414
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,519
Red light, green light.

415
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,990
Why haven't I heard of this place...

416
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,700
while combing through
every children's home in Korea?

417
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Red light, green light.

418
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,589
Excuse me, sir.

419
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,990
Have you worked here
for a long time?

420
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,329
I was wondering
if you knew anyone...

421
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,089
who worked here 20 years ago.

422
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,380
Yeo Jin, I was the most worried...

423
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,750
about how we could
keep Eun Chong safe.

424
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,390
Watch where you're going.

425
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,759
You ran into me on purpose.

426
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,900
So what?
Do you want me to apologize?

427
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,329
I know you won't.

428
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,029
Forget it.

429
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,400
Are you working on
a new personality?

430
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,740
Stop acting like you're so cool.

431
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:54,599
What?

432
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,039
Did you just sigh?

433
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,440
No.

434
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,309
(Ms. Yoon Se Young,
your photo album has been delivered.)

435
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,450
My wedding photos are here.

436
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,789
This is the concept proposal
for the mother-daughter therapy tour.

437
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,960
Please take a look at this,
then split up the tasks among us.

438
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,329
Are we taking part
in the mother-daughter therapy?

439
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,069
I wanted to do it.

440
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,230
Be quiet.

441
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,799
Did you just bring this for my eyes?

442
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,240
Look at this footprint!

443
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,210
You told me to save
on our office supplies.

444
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,980
It was your footprint,
so I figured it'd be fine.

445
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,109
You have a knack for sarcasm.

446
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,720
You must be out of your mind
thinking the chairwoman adores you.

447
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,589
You can do everything
just as you want,

448
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,190
from checking the schedule
to making a list of vendors!

449
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,319
I never said
I wanted to do this alone.

450
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,990
I already told you that
I wanted to do it with the team.

451
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,759
Sure, then I'll split up the tasks
just as you want.

452
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,299
Ms. Goo, you're in charge
of finding the vendors.

453
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:58,500
Find the places to dine
and hold therapy sessions.

454
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,200
Bring me 100 each.

455
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,470
- Did you say 100?
- What's wrong? You can't do it?

456
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,880
- I can.
- Have it ready by tomorrow morning.

457
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,710
"Tomorrow morning?"

458
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,890
Ms. Chairwoman, let's go.

459
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,619
The weather is cold.

460
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,089
- What about the drawing?
- I brought it.

461
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,690
She thanked you for the donation.

462
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,400
Gosh.

463
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,230
Goodness, that must've hurt.

464
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,400
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

465
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,509
How old are you?

466
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:38,880
I'm seven years old.

467
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,240
You're seven?

468
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,880
My grandson must be as big as you.

469
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,079
Is your grandson here?

470
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,450
- No.
- Then?

471
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:52,589
I don't know yet.

472
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,700
I need to find my grandson
right now.

473
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,700
I'll do every possible thing I can
to find him.

474
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,640
Why don't you wait
until Mr. Yoon replies...

475
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,839
I don't need him.

476
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,009
It feels like
he's trying to torture me to death.

477
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,740
How can he be
this cold and heartless?

478
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,450
He must know how I feel,

479
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,519
but he's only watching
like we're total strangers.

480
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,049
I'll find him...

481
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,920
on my own.

482
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,549
Gosh, I'm starving.

483
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,480
Whatever. I can't do this anymore.

484
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,849
If you want to fire me over this,
just do that, Yoon Se Young.

485
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,230
You were still here?

486
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,759
Yes, did you return just now?

487
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,069
I was about to leave.

488
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,400
Then, let's leave together.

489
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,099
I just need to pick up a file.

490
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,599
Okay.

491
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,819
- Let's go.
- Okay.

492
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,420
Oh, my.

493
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,490
I haven't had dinner yet,
so let me settle one of my debts.

494
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,890
If it's all right with you,
do you want to eat dinner?

495
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,460
Sure.

496
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,059
One moment.

497
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,130
Hey, Se Young.

498
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,170
- Where are you?
- I'm at the office.

499
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:48,509
I just came back.

500
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,779
Where did you go with Aunt Yeo Jin?

501
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,410
We did a round with our customers.

502
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:57,609
Ms. Jang wasn't in good condition,
so I accompanied her instead.

503
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,849
Is that so?

504
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,549
I heard our wedding album arrived
at our newlywed home,

505
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,589
so I came by to put it inside.

506
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,690
Yes, and you know...

507
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,430
I'll call you later.

508
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,700
Did you look into that delivery?

509
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,099
Mind your own business.
I don't care about it, either.

510
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,700
I guess you haven't looked into it.

511
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,140
If you're that curious,
look it up yourself.

512
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,109
Take the next elevator.

513
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,140
Right, the delivery.

514
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,470
I didn't see anything
in front of my door.

515
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,410
(Delivered to:
The front of your door)

516
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,609
What's going on?

517
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,589
I'm calling from Lala Palace
Block 4, Unit 1002.

518
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,160
- I didn't receive my parcel.
- One moment.

519
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,059
I'm sorry.
It must've gone to Unit 1001.

520
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,759
- I apologize.
- What?

521
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,970
(To: Hwang Jin Goo, Yoon Se Young)

522
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,700
Why is there a parcel here
that isn't ours?

523
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,269
I saw it by the door
on my way to work,

524
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,809
so I thought it was yours
and brought it in.

525
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,109
- Isn't it yours?
- It's the place across the hall.

526
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,710
They'll come for it, I guess.

527
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,880
Okay. Bye.

528
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,630
I heard my parcel was
delivered to your place.

529
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,789
Come in.

530
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,759
- Just give me the parcel.
- Come in and take it.

531
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,549
Eat up.

532
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,680
Thank you.

533
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,779
Wait. Let me mix a drink for you.

534
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,849
No, I'll have lemon-lime soda.
I can't take my alcohol.

535
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,559
- You should have some.
- No, I'll do it.

536
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,759
It's all about the ratio.

537
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,000
Did you work overtime
for the mother-daughter therapy tour?

538
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:33,369
Yes.

539
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,839
The chairwoman expects a lot,
so I want to do a great job.

540
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,410
Right. Have you ever
been on a trip with your mother?

541
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,609
No.

542
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm such an awful son.

543
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,049
I was the president
of a travel agency,

544
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,950
yet I've never gone on a trip
with my mother.

545
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,119
I'm sure there's a good reason.

546
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,460
If everything went as you hoped,

547
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,589
that wouldn't be your life,
but someone else's.

548
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,089
Someone else's life?

549
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,470
I'll do a great job with
the mother-daughter therapy tour...

550
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,940
and plan a mother-son therapy tour
as well.

551
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,940
I'd like to have you...

552
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,940
and your mother as my first guests.

553
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,339
- Make sure you keep that promise.
- Okay.

554
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,450
Eun Chong and me, too.

555
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,150
Join the mother-son therapy tour.

556
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,549
Yes.

557
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,150
Right! I forgot to return
the condolence money...

558
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,789
you gave Eun Chong.

559
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,960
Why are you returning this?

560
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,730
The DNA test result came out,
and she wasn't his grandmother.

561
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,029
What?

562
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,369
But you gave her a funeral and all.

563
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,470
How can this happen?

564
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,569
You can just keep it.

565
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,440
You held a funeral anyway,
so let me pitch in.

566
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,539
- No, it's okay.
- Just keep it.

567
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,349
Then, I'll give it to Eun Chong.

568
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,490
Is this good news for him?

569
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,190
That's how we'll take it.

570
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,059
If his grandmother is alive,
he'll meet her someday.

571
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:06,029
If you agree, cheers.

572
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,500
Cheers.

573
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,000
Cheers.

574
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,470
It's so good.

575
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,109
It's all about the ratio
when it comes to a soju mix.

576
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,950
Have some.

577
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,519
It's good.

578
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,490
(Cinderella Game)

579
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,029
I met a man in the director's office
at the children's home,

580
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,460
and he kept staying on my mind.

581
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,500
Who's that old man?

582
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,369
Do you think
Auntie Ha Na has a boyfriend?

583
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,670
Ha Na, do you have a boyfriend?

584
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,410
She's searching for Eun Chong
so desperately.

585
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,640
I'm afraid people will hear
that he's of Hyesung Group's blood.

586
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,640
I'll find you and protect you.

587
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,250
We should stick to our plan
and focus on Hyesung Tour.

588
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,980
I'll never crash down.

589
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,190
I'll rise even higher,
away from your sight.
